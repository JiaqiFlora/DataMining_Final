Why do minor keys sound “sad”? [closed],"The major key is present by nature in every note that is played. Therefore, it is interpreted as normal behavior, a happy day in our lives, 'cause that's what we expect to happen. The minor key is opposed to the major key and it's perceived by us (without being aware) as if there was something wrong, hence sadness or restlessness. Further explanation:
When you hear a note, what you're really hearing are vibrations. For each note there is a whole set of vibrations that take in place, and that we don't even perceive. When you play a low C, you're not hearing only C, but every other harmonic or overtone that belongs to C. That is, going from lower to higher in pitch, the low C being played, then C (octave), then G, then another C, then E, so on and so forth, each time being less the distance between the current overtone and the next one. As you may have noticed, this first 5 notes (C, C, G, C, E) form the major triad. This means that by nature, the major triad is always present. The note that results in the minor triad is E flat, which is the 18th overtone in the harmonic series. For this reason, and because the major triad is always there, it results in a contradiction that our human nature understands as sadness, unconformity, and restlessness. If you want to go deeper into this, I strongly recommend Leonard Bernstein's lectures ""The Unanswered Question"", in which he engages in a deep and detailed explanation on this and other similar matters. Here lies musical universality. Edit: It can be considered universal, as physics have demonstrated its existence in nature and, as the same Bernstein says, the major triad (and even until the pentatonic scale, which would user overtones 5 and 6) can be found in every culture around the world."
Why is the guitar tuned like it is?,"I've seen it argued that the instrument that became the guitar started with the major G chord set, the second, third and fourth string, probably in pairs, as the entire string set for the instrument. The first string was then added, and the lower strings were added in fourths to provide more bass harmony, much the same way we see the 7th string being brought in these days. Man, I wish I could source that. In a more practical manner, I play mandolin, which is tuned in fifths. For melodies, it makes great sense to tune in fifths. Scales that seem kinda haphazard on guitar just lay out so nicely on the mandolin. But chords are ugly hand-stretchers. David Grisman, a great bluegrass and newgrass mandolin player, suggests that if you have to play four-or-more-note chords, drop the root and let someone else play it. Guitars, being tuned mostly in fourths, make chords much easier."
What's the point of keys other than C and Am?,"The keys are only identical on equal-tempered instruments, but that's most modern western instruments like pianos. Wind instruments other than the trombone are built to be (mostly) equal tempered [EDIT: I might be simplifying too much here, see David's comment below], but the players can bend pitches somewhat. The trombone, all non-fretted string instruments, and vocalists have more control over small variations and only have to be equal-tempered if they're playing with other instruments that don't have the flexibility. But that's fairly academic and theoretical. You've hit the nail on the head in your second paragraph. The primary purpose of multiple keys is for modulation within a single piece, but yes, some instruments sound better or are easier to play in some keys more than in others. Any vocalist will have keys that they tend to feel more comfortable and sound better in. As a general rule, orchestral string instruments will sound much bigger and richer in keys like D-Major, A-Major and, to a slightly lesser extent, C-major and G-major. This is because the open-strings of these instruments are Es, As, D, Gs and Cs, and all of these open strings will vibrate sympathetically with the notes that tend to be used the most in those keys. On the opposite end of the spectrum, Ab and Eb Major tend to sound a little dull and muddled on those instruments. Some keys fall under the hands more easily than others on the piano. For instance, non-pianists are often surprised to see that F# and C# Major/minor are relatively common keys for solo literature, but it makes sense because those keys tend to feel nice under the fingers--especially when the thumb can just play the occasional white key while the other fingers stick largely to the black keys. I'm sure other answers will talk about other important considerations, but that's a sampling. EDIT: Oh, and I should add that all instruments have a lowest possible note, and most have either a highest possible, or at least a highest standard range of notes. Writing for cello in B-major is often frustrating because, without detuning the instrument, the lowest possible note is a C. Writing for a Bb clarinet (the key of a transposing instrument is a whole other can of worms that is related to, but distinct from, the keys you can have them play in) in Db is perhaps not the best idea since its lowest (sounding) pitch is D natural. Etc."
Why are there twelve notes in an octave?,"This requires an excursion into musical history. Originally, instruments were made to simply play notes that sounded ""right"" together. Why some notes sounded right and others wrong wasn't of great concern for most of humanity's history, until Pythagoras, (yes, the guy with the theorem) noticed that it had to do with intervals, and made a music theory based on perfect fifths. This theory had its problems, however, and was improved upon by later people, eventually ending up on what is called a ""just intonation"" Basically, notes sound harmonious if the frequency of the notes is close to a simple interval, like 3/2 or 5/4. These theories were important because it meant it was possible for different instrument makers to make instruments that could play scales together, thereby making orchestras.  But just tuning has a problem: you can basically only play the scale that the instrument is built for, because the intervals between the notes are different. If you play a tune on the wrong scale, it will sounds out of tune. This means that if you want to sing along with the instrument, you have to find a singer whose range fits the song in the scale the instrument is built for. You can't transpose the song to fit the singer. Also, musicians were exploring the limits of what you could do with just intoned instruments. So out of this came then the equal temperament. It splits the scale into equal intervals, meaning you can transpose a tune into other keys, and also means you can do dramatic chord changes and other interesting things. You can indeed split the octave into 11 or 13 notes if you should wish to do so, but to most people it will sound out of tune. But when you split it into 12 notes, you get close enough to the seven notes of just intonation for it to be bearable, except to some unlucky few supposedly burdened with overactive perfect pitch. The five tones that are in between the basic seven are, as expected, called ""half-tones"". There are equal temperaments other than the 12 tones per octave that will sound fine, but they don't generally have a integer number of notes per octave. Wendy Carlos experimented a lot with this, and made such scales as the Gamma scale with a slightly mind-boggling 34.29 notes per octave."
Is there any real-world difference between time signatures such as 4/4 and 8/8?,"A time signature is simply the composer's way of telling you how s/he is subdividing the measure.  So in 4/4 time, the composer imagines the measure divided into four beats, while in 8/8 time, the composer imagines the measure divided into eight beats.  The difference is less in the strict timing and more in the feel or pulse of the music. Try counting these out loud: All three of these take up exactly the same amount of time, but to me, the 4/4 time feels steady, while the 8/8 time feels brisk and the 2/2 time feels stately.  In all three time signatures, a quarter note will have the same value—one quarter of the measure—but in 4/4 time, it represents the pulse of the music, while in 8/8, it's two pulses and in 2/2 time, it's half a pulse. A difference in feel between 3/4 and 6/8 time can be even more obvious.  In 3/4 time, the measure is broken up into three distinct beats, as in a waltz.  In 6/8 time, by contrast, the measure is often broken up into two beats, each with a triplet feel.  Like this: If the composer writes three quarter notes in 3/4 time, it will feel like three notes on the beat.  But if the composer writes three quarter notes in 6/8 time, the second note may feel syncopated relative to the overall pulse of the music. Update: Listen to the first twenty seconds or so of La Pistola y El Corazon by Los Lobos. Is it in 3/4 or 6/8 time? Depending on how you hear it, the music has a much different feel, with the lead guitars putting emphasis on different parts of the melody. Listen a few times and try to hear it both ways!"
What is good software for learning how to sight-read?,"Jalmus provides what you are looking for and it has a MIDI interface. It is also free open source, is cross platform (written in Java, it works on Windows, Linux, and Mac), and is available in English, French, Spanish, Italian, Danish and German. From the website: Jalmus is a free, open source music
  education software helping the
  musicians, especially pianists, to
  improve their sight-reading. You can
  train to read music with both
  exercises on notes or rhythms. Update development of Jalamus stopped at version 2.3, but the software is still available for download at sourceforge"
What are the most effective ear training methods?,"I break ear training into 3 different categories: There are a lot of methods to attack each of these areas. These do all relate, but I found that it helps to treat them differently as I found that ability in one does not always mean ability in the other. Identify notes from hearing them:
The main method for this is dictation and transcription. You listen to music, or tunes and or harmonies generated by program or just recordings. It helps to start with simple things and build on this as you get better.  The ability to tune pitches:
Singing with a drone really helps with this. You really feel how a tone fits against the tonal center drone by doing this. Also, playing something like a bass line on the piano and singing the melody, and the other way around, can help with this. A lot of intonation comes from the ability to hear the tonal center of the music and the harmonies. When you can internally hear harmonies and the tonal center you can tune accordingly. Ability to ""hear"" music form looking at sheet music before it is played:
I believe sight singing is the best method for this. I strongly believe in using solfege, and fixed do solfege (as most people start to develop some sense of perfect pitch over time) is one of the best ways to do this. You can first learn to sing intervals, and then simple melodies.  When you can't ""hear"" an interval in your head before singing it you can fill in the notes between the current note and the next notes with scale notes (best to do them as quick grace notes if you can). If you are lost, you sing the tonal note (the note of the key that the music is in) and then do a scale up to the interval. Eventually, you won't need to sing these in between notes any more.   The above method of singing the tonal center or filling in notes is important. Don't play the notes on a piano before singing them because it should be coming from you and not the instrument. Worst case scenario, play the tonal center note on the piano if you get lost, and build up from there. Everything when you are learning this relates to the tonal center, not the previous pitch -- this keeps you from getting off among other things. Be Patient:
All of these skills, like playing an instrument, take time. Don't get discouraged, start with the basics in each area and move up as you get better. You start with simple intervals and scales. Then move on to navigating a key fluently. You then learn how to do transitions between different keys. Lastly, if you get advanced you work on stuff that is either atonal or near atonal. This process will likely take years, and is often something musicians work on throughout their whole life."
How can I significantly improve my hand independence on piano?,"Try Bach's Two Part Inventions (BWV 772–801). They were titled by Bach: ""Honest method, by which the amateurs of the keyboard – especially, however, those desirous of learning – are shown a clear way not only (1) to learn to play cleanly in two parts, but also, after further progress, (2) to handle three obligate parts correctly and well; and along with this not only to obtain good inventions (ideas) but to develop the same well; above all, however, to achieve a cantabile style in playing and at the same time acquire a strong foretaste of composition."" There are 15 two part inventions and 15 three part inventions.  In working through the two part inventions, myself, I found that I had developed hand independence and learned some beautiful songs in the process.  You can get the scores at IMSLP.  Good luck."
Purpose of double-sharps and double-flats?,"Often it has to do with altering notes in a key that are already sharpened or flattened, such as a harmonic minor in a key where the 7th is a sharp.  Take G♯ minor: You could write F♯♯ (or F𝄪) as a G, but then your scale would have no F note in it but two different G's.  Every time you put down an G note, you'd have to attach a sharp or natural to indicate which note is to be played.  It's clearer to have an F𝄪 and a G♯ than to have a G and a G♯.  And some will insist that every scale should have one of each letter-note. I also suspect than in just intonation there's a difference between a doubly-accidentaled note and what would be the equivalent note in equal temperament (i.e., F𝄪 is not actually the same sound/frequency as G).  This answer to another question does a good job of explaining that."
How do professional accompanying musicians (seem to) figure out songs instantly?,"There are formulas and sets of harmony formulas that musicians know of. ie. Chord Formation. I, IV, V7 sets of harmony; Chord Substitution; Fifth Motion, Dominant motion; Diatonic Cycles of Fifths, Chord Tone Substitutions, etc. Each chords in each set have their own characteristics that you need to know what they represent. I can be indicative of what each chord's character are like but the fastest way to teach you that is through you experiencing it. With that, once someone says: Gimme a C or whatever, immediately the musician knows the set of harmony ideas they must employ. And with their sense of feelings and hearing they will know what the next chord should be. Of course they do make mistakes. That is where they correct themselves along the way in real time. In my place, we call it 'bluffology"" - bluff our way through. Done properly, most people will not know our mistakes. It does takes time to acquire such skill but the mindset must be tuned that way first."
Is there a way to measure the consonance or dissonance of a chord?,"Yes, there are ways to measure it, though there are many different algorithms claiming to be more correct than the others.  This formula by Vassilakis is recent (2007). These measure ""roughness"", which is similar to dissonance.  (Dissonance is basically roughness, but weighted towards certain intervals due to cultural conditioning, which is obviously hard to measure quantitatively.)  For two sine tones, roughness vs frequency difference looks like this: 
 (Source: William A. Sethares) For more complex signals, made up of multiple tones: The roughness of signals corresponding to spectra with more than two sine components is calculated by summing the roughness of all sine-pairs in the spectrum. For tones with harmonic spectra, the net effect of the roughness between all the harmonics present produces graphs with notches of consonance at intervals that we're familiar with, like 3:2 perfect fifth:   The black curve is from the older Plomp-Levelt 1965 paper, with this description: We assume that the total dissonance of such an interval is equal to the sum of the dissonances of each pair of adjacent partials ... these presuppositions are rather speculative ... In this way, the curves ... were computed for complex tones consisting of 6 harmonics. ... shows how the consonance of some intervals, given by simple frequency ratios, depends on frequency. (So the Plomp-Levelt curve is based on summing up the roughness of adjacent partials while Vassilakis sums ""all sine-pairs"".  (Sethares wrote me and says the ""adjacent"" thing is just because computational power was limited in the 60s.  Comparing every pair is more appropriate.)) Further descriptions of this curve can be found in Marc Leman - Foundations of musicology as content processing science (which also talks about deriving the slendro and pelog scales from the same algorithm applied to inharmonic gong instruments) and Plomp and Levelt's Hidden Ratio The blue curve is from Sethares Relating Tuning and Timbre, which uses this MATLAB calculation, also based on the Plomp-Levelt curves.  (And here's my Python translation.)  Here's a MATLAB-based app that uses the 2007 Vassilakis model to also calculate the same curve for 6 harmonics (and has the M3 as more consonant than the m3). You can see the two curves disagree on whether the m3 or M3 is more consonant.  I'm not sure if this is due to calculating only adjacent partials vs all partials or if the partials have different amplitudes or what. Of course, real instruments produce lots of variation in their harmonic spectra, even playing the same note on the same instrument, so these curves are all inherently approximations.  Here's a plot I made of violin vs clarinet, showing that the M3 is more consonant when the violin is playing the higher note, due to clarinets producing mostly odd harmonics. Also, for more than 2 tones, the Sethares algorithm ranks minor and major chords as equally consonant, which is not the usual interpretation.  So Erlich and Monzo interpret Sethares' number as only a measure of ""roughness"" and require ""dissonance"" to include both ""roughness"" and ""tonalness"", where major chords are more consonant because they are closer to the root of a harmonic series (4:5:6) while minor chords are farther away (10:12:15).  I don't know of a way to quantify that for arbitrary frequencies, though."
Ten Minute Practice Techniques For Guitar?,"One thing I often do in that situation is pick a scale and play it in different positions on the neck. Or vary it further by double-picking or triple-picking each note, or using hammer-ons/pull-offs. This video has Joe Satriani showing a few exercises that would fit well in the short time frame as well. Last but not least, if you have a song you're working on and some part of it is giving you trouble, you can isolate that part in a short exercise that you can do even without going through the whole song."
How to play a song without making mistakes?,"You will always make mistakes, so the key is practicing in a way that eliminates mistakes.  ""Practice makes perfect"" is a Big Lie. If you don't practice in a smart method you will never get that good -- so what is important is not just practice itself, but good practice technique. When practicing a piece of music or song, there are really two modes I would practice in: With both of these the idea is practice makes permanent, not perfect. If you just keep hammering mindlessly away at a passage and playing it wrong, you get get better at playing it wrong. That is why you want to think before you play, and start slow. When you do this, you basically never or rarely actually play it wrong. Remember this stuff takes time, playing the same section over and over and over again for an hour in one day is a waste of time. Play a section slowly maybe 2-5 times, then speed it up. When you hit your speed limit for the day, just move on to the next section. The reason is that these skills actually develop while you sleep, so you can't really force it. "
How do you draw a quarter rest with a pen/pencil?,"From: Music Notation Drawing Rests  Theory Project 2: Preparing Scores To draw the quarter rest, draw the
  right side of a letter “R”, omitting
  the vertical, or start with a number
  “2”, but pull the horizontal line down
  on the right. Put the hook on the
  bottom and it’s done. The quarter rest
  is a letter “R” suitable for being
  placed next to a letter with a
  vertical right side. It’s right out of
  Gutenberg’s Bible. The hook on the
  bottom is merely embellishment. The “classical” quarter rest is a
  mirror-reversed 8th rest. Don’t use
  it. Some people draw a version of the “S”
  rest which was introduced in the very
  early 1800’s to replace the
  “classical” rest. The “S” rest is like
  an S or backwards “Z” with the top and
  bottom concave instead of convex or
  straight. Another way to draw it is to
  make a line down and curving left,
  straight to the right, and then
  curving left and down. That is the
  easiest way to start, and I recommend
  it to you. If you rotate that
  clockwise you have an “S” rest. Or
  copy the eighth doubled and backwards.
  Or chop away half of both curves of a
  Gutenberg rest. There is a lot of variation to be
  found in the quarter rest. The problem
  with the Gutenberg rest is that it
  takes too much vertical space and
  therefore collides with other rests or
  notes too often. For handwriting
  music, the Gutenberg rest and the
  classical rest are the worst, in my
  opinion."
Quickly flip a page of sheet music while playing,"One of the tricks you can use is one I have learned watching Gustav Leonhardt in concert. For difficult page turns, he uses a little copy of the start of the next page that he pastes on the side of the preceding right page as a flip. Not only is it easier on his memory but it allows to grab the page quickly and turn it efficiently.  Now that scanners and printers exist, this is really easy to do.
Leonhardt often copied the parts by hand (which is not bad for memory). A related thing you can do is to copy the right and left side and putting them in front of you at the same time when studying the passage. It will flow better in general, you will be less dependent of the precise moment you do the page turns, when you use the original score (which is usually required in concert for copyright reasons)."
How long would it take to learn to tune a piano?,"I would encourage anyone who is interested to tune their own piano. My personal experience is... (I am an amateur in the true sense (Latin: ""To Love""), have played piano for 8 years and probably tuned my own piano for 5 years (when I have time)) It probably took me about a week (off and on, I suppose about 6 hours) to completely retune my old piano from the ground up after having watched several hours of (slow, boring) instructional video. My tools were I actually never learned the cost to have a piano tuned, but I hear it is expensive, so I would say it is worth it. It is not that hard, although it takes a long time at first. Here are some tips. (personal experience, upright piano) When tuning by ear, (this is hard to describe), when two notes are close, but not just right, there is like a small wild ring. Also, normally the tones of two notes seem to fluctuate like long waves with sub waves. The long waves are the easiest to measure I think. The long waves of the two notes should match up. Let me know if you have any questions. This is all personal experience."
Why are there both sharps and flats? [duplicate],"Pretty basic and simple. Each key has 7 notes, with a different letter name for each. A B C D E F G but not always starting on A!! Let's take Gmajor G A B C D E F G - except the F needs to be F#. So far so good with your idea. Let's take Fmajor. F G A A# C D E F. Oops, there are two A notes - and no B. Try writing it out on the lines and spaces we call staves. See the problem? EDIT: For the commenters who may have missed my reasoning - still in key F - What would you do about a key signature for that key. Possibly put a # so the A notes get changed? Oops again! Every time an A nat. was needed, it'd have to be marked. Or, no key sig. Then # each A as needed. And there'd never be a note on the middle line, treble clef. What a waste! 2nd EDIT: maybe for the folks who found the answer difficult to understand. For simply naming the black keys on pianos, we could indeed just use sharps - or flats alone. But even that would create a dichotomy. Some would prefer sharps, some flats. The problem is actually alive and kicking on some guitar driven sites, where flats seem to have become obsolete. Any note which is not a simple letter name takes on the name of the next note down, and adds a sharp. Thus a semitone above A is A♯, that above D is D♯ and so on.  That means that a chord such as F minor gets spelled F G♯ C. Which could work. Find each 'note' on guitar (or piano, if you like), and play. Voila, an Fm chord!  Take a chord sequence, in key F major. Chord IV becomes A♯. For those with very little understanding of theory, that's not a problem. Those with more experience know immediately there's no A♯ chord (or note, even) in key F. It's called B♭ - and has been for centuries. (Unless you're German!) So, if the original part of the answer was insufficient, stuff learned by tens of thousands of musos would be invalidated by purely using sharps (or flats)."
How often should I replace the strings on my guitar?,"Depends on two factors: Some strings, like ""bright bronze"", can lose their sound qualities after a few hours of playing. Others, like ""silk and steel"", can be played for 100 or more hours. The correct answer is: when you feel that sound isn't bright as it used to be, it is time to change strings. You can prolong string life time if you "
"What is the relationship between ""do re mi"" and note letter names?","Do-re-mi-etc. is ""sol-fa"" or ""solfege"".  Sol-fa represents a major scale, with Do being the first note, Re being the second, and so on. I'm sure you can sing that scale. The A-G note names are absolute names for a certain note. An 'A' is an 'A' no matter what key you are performing in. There are two variants of sol-fa. Fixed do and Movable do. Fixed do is used in China, France, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Romania, Russia, South America and parts of North America, Japan, and Vietnam.  In fixed-do, Do is always equivalent to C; Re is always equivalent to D; and so on. Movable Do is used in Britain, Germany, Indian classical music, and the United States. In movable-do, you can pick a different pitch to start on, and sing Do-re-mi-... starting at that note. What you are doing when you do that is singing the major scale in different keys. If you are singing in C major, d,r,m,f,s,l,t,d is C,D,E,F,G,A,B,C If you are singing in D major, d,r,m,f,s,l,t,d is D,E,F♯,G,A,B,C♯,D ... and so on. In both forms, there are other phonetic names for sharp and flat names. The complete list is on Wikipedia."
What is the difference between a mode and a scale?,"A ""scale"", technically defined, is a sequence of ascending or descending ""unit pitches"" that form a palette of notes that can be used to form a melody. Most scales in Western music conform to a particular ""key""; that is, a sequence of notes that will be ""sharp"" or ""flat"" by default. Not all scales have keys; the chromatic scale is a scale of all possible semitone steps used in Western music, while the whole-tone scale is a scale composed of intervals two semitones apart. Within a particular key, there are 7 notes in a single octave, before reaching the 8th note which is named the same as the first note and is at double the frequency. The seven notes have differing intervals between adjacent notes; sometimes it's one half-step (semitone), while other times it's a whole step (two semitones). The pattern of whole-step/half-step intervals that determine the notes of a key, starting from the note for while the key is named, is whole-whole-half-whole-whole-whole-half. Within a single key, each of those seven notes could be used as the ""base"" note of an ascending sequence. Each such sequence, created by starting on a different note in the key, is a ""mode"" of that key, and each mode has a name: More reading: Wikipedia - Musical Mode"
"Changing the strings: one by one, or by taking all strings off at one time?","I have heard that it is not a problem taking them off all at once, and luthiers I have seen work on instruments will take all the strings off to clean the fretboard and alter the bridge. This website corroborates this theory, saying: It's definitely OK to take off all the strings on any fretted instrument. It's just an old husband's tale that taking off all the strings will injure the neck or any other part of the instrument. And further: ...your instrument would ""rather"" have no strings at all! Collectors and others who put their instruments into storage usually either remove the strings or detune completely. It does, however, mention the practical benefits of changing one at a time; guitars with movable bridges are best done like this to stop the bridge moving. Also, if you don't have a tuner to hand, changing one string at a time makes it easier to tune up to the right pitch."
Best method to learn to play barre chords?,"I was struggling with my barre chords, but then my teacher showed me two great exercises. I've been doing them for a week or two and--it's a miracle--barre chords started sounding good! Just hold all the strings on fret 7 with your first finger and nothing else and check if all the strings sound clear. You can help with your second finger. When all notes are clear, move to fret 6. And so on, until you reach fret 1. Hold your barre on fret 7 and with the other three fingers, do this pattern, picking one note at a time: Keep holding the barre on fret 7 for the whole exercise! By the time you get to string 1, your hand will hurt like hell, but that is the purpose - to get your hand strong. Rest for a while, and do the same thing on fret 6, and so on until fret 1. Do this every day for 2 weeks--and you'll be able to play barre chords with ease."
What's the difference between a G♭ and an F#?,"See the section on tuning systems on Wikipedia for some background. In short, most intervals do not sound best on equally-tempered scales (where the distance between any two consecutive half steps is the same) but on ones where the notes vary in distance. For instance, fifths usually sound the most in tune when the frequencies are in a 2:3 ratio. Because of this, G♭ and F♯ will often sound different depending on which scale they're being used in and which notes they are played with. As far as I know, G♭ is never higher than F♯, always lower (or perhaps the same, like on a piano)."
Why is C the base note of standard notation and keys?,"This was already partially answered here, and there's a pretty comprehensive explanation here. Notes do not ""start"" with C; C major is just the easiest major key to notate in modern notation. The concept of a major key came about long after letters were assigned to the notes. Before there were major (and minor) keys, people used modes, usually just using the notes of the modern white keys and starting and ending in different places. The Ionian mode (which became modern major) was a late addition to the modes.  So it's historical accident that C major is treated as ""basic."""
Ways to get out of a scalar rut?,"Do you transcribe other players' solos?  I find this helps me a lot, especially when I transcribe non-guitarists' solos.  The clichés and idioms on other instruments are simply different than they are on guitar, so that can help to see melody from a different perspective.  Trumpets and saxophones, in particular, sit in a similar range to the guitar but have completely different styles of play. To get the most out of transcribing solos, here are some points I think are important: Choose solos you love, but from which you can learn.  For example, I love the playing the blues and I want to expand my repertoire of blues ideas, but I don't transcribe Stevie Ray Vaughn solos.  I love Stevie's playing, but I can't learn from it anymore.  He played exactly what I would have played, if only I could play better.  This is not to take anything away from Stevie, who did in fact play better than I do, but just to point out that I won't learn much from a Stevie solo that I don't already know. On the other hand, I just transcribed Oliver Nelson's solo on ""Stolen Moments"", from his record Blues and the Abstract Truth (his solo starts at 4:14 and goes to about 5:54).  ""Stolen Moments"" is also a blues, and Wikipedia describes his solo in it as ""contain[ing] 'possibly the most famous' use of the augmented scale in jazz.""  I didn't know that at the time I started transcribing it (I just looked up the Wikipedia page as I was writing this), but I knew it was beautiful, lyrical, haunting, and entirely different from anything I would have thought of playing. Get it right. Not just the notes, but the timing and the inflection as well.  Get some software that slows music down without altering its pitch and allows you a great deal of scrubbing and looping control.  I've used both the Amazing Slow Downer and Capo, and both are very good. Getting the timing right is especially hard for me, but there's a lot to learn there.  I have a tendency to overplay and to rush, and forcing myself to absolutely nail the timing on, say, a Miles Davis solo has taught me a lot about relaxing and staying in and behind the pocket.  The inflection isn't as hard for me, but sometimes it's hard for my students.  They don't seem to hear things like grace notes, slides, bends, vibrato, etc., the kinds of things that give the solo its vocal-like quality. Write it down. This is important on so many levels.  It will improve your reading, improve your knowledge of the fretboard, and it will really force you to grapple with the timing.  Does that phrase really start on the 'and' of 3?  How long is that pause?  I thought those were sixteenth notes, but if they are, then the notes in this measure don't add up to four quarters. Hm. Writing the solo out will also help with analysis.  Once you've written it down, go back and write the chord symbols over the staff as they occur in the song.  Then analyze the solo to see how the notes and phrases work with the chords.  If you really want to go nuts with this, listen carefully to the chords that the other players are actually playing rather than the chords in the chart---they may be using alterations and substitutions, and the soloist may be playing off of those. To be blunt: if you know the solo, write it down.  If you can't write it down, you don't really know the solo. Wisdom from Miles.  Miles famously said about soloing, ""Play what you hear, not what you know.""  In other words, when you're soloing, don't think about augmented scales and minor-7th arpeggios.  Listen instead to what's in your heart and your head, and play that.  Easier said than done, obviously, but this is exactly how transcribing helps the most: it trains your heart and head to hear ideas you wouldn't otherwise have, and it trains your fingers to execute better what you hear."
How can a classical pianist learn jazz piano?,"Do you listen to jazz? I think a big part of getting into jazz as a trained musician means experimenting on your own. One of the biggest challenges for you will likely be learning the style of jazz piano, i.e. being able to play and not sound ""square"". If you want a listening list, check this out: ""100 Greatest Jazz Pianists"". The top 5 would be plenty to get you started--you could probably set up a Pandora station and be set for a good while. The best jazz musicians learned by doing. They learned the ""rules"" in an intuitive sense just by going to gigs and using their ears. Now we have jazz educators, of course, so that process can be made a little less painstaking. One such jazz educator has written the well-regarded Jazz Piano Book that may be enough to get you off the ground if you don't want to go out and find a teacher. You can also find plenty of books to get you familiar with jazz voicings through notation. The extremely popular Jamey Aebersold Play-A-Long series contains a selection of transcribed piano voicings from the existing play along CDs."
Why Is Just Intonation Impractical?,"Yes, you're right.  As for why the harmonic series doesn't produce notes that work in all keys, the simple answer is that the math just doesn't add up. Let's work out the math for just intonation: Suppose you choose X Hz for the fundamental frequency and go from there.  Then the octave above the fundamental should have frequency 2X Hz.  Meanwhile, the perfect fifth above X will have frequency 3⁄2 X Hz.  The perfect fifth above that will have frequency 3⁄2 * 3⁄2 X = 9⁄4 X Hz.  Continuing on the cycle of fifths, you can easily see that every pitch generated this way will have frequency (3⁄2)n X Hz for some exponent n. If there are twelve tones in the chromatic scale, then (3⁄2)12 X should be some whole number of octaves above X, i.e. (3⁄2)12 must equal a power of two.  But this is impossible because no power of 2 can have 3 in its prime factorization, as all powers of 3⁄2 must have.  Indeed, if you don't insist that the chromatic scale have twelve tones, you still can't make the math work: (3⁄2)n != 2m for any positive integer values of n and m. Is it close, though?  Not close enough. (3⁄2)12 = 129.74, and the closest power of 2 is 27 = 128.  In practical terms, this means that the A one octave above A440 is 440 * 129.74 / 64 = 892 Hz, which is definitely audibly distinct from the pure 880 Hz you'd expect.  The math just doesn't work—just intonation cannot produce a set of pitches that work well in all keys."
How can I overcome the fear of performing in front of an audience?,"I had a teacher who liked to say ""The key to overcoming performance anxiety is through rigorous application of technique."" This basically means: practice, practice, practice. Practice not until you get it right, but until you can't get it wrong. Practice until the technique you have to execute on the guitar is just as natural as clapping your hands. There are pharmaceutical means that are endorsed by some teachers in very rare cases (called beta blockers); a natural alternative is known by many to be contained in the common banana. I include that tidbit for the sake of completeness, but I really don't recommend it. You will reap far greater benefits from practicing more and more efficiently, and learning how to relax yourself and gain greater self-awareness of tension in your own body. Some other practical suggestions: Start out small. Many musicians encounter performance anxiety only once they go to music school and need to play for large audiences. Before you have a big performance, perform for just one person, then a small group of friends, then perhaps your studio class, etc. If you're even having trouble working up to the one person level, try performing for your cat! Memorization can be tricky, and is a personally major source of anxiety for me when I need to perform memorized. As before, apply technique rigorously to the end of being able to write out the entire piece of music note for note completely from memory. Then do the same thing on a different level (i.e. the sections of the piece, Theme I, Theme II, AABA form, Eb major to G minor, what have you). Lastly, it sounds a little like you are only playing for your friends when they ask you to, which has the psychological effect of calling you out and putting you on the spot. Instead, try preparing a piece of music that you are totally comfortable with, and then perform it for them on YOUR terms."
Found in an 1800s newspaper--what kind of march notation is this?,"It is ""a new system of music"" that was set forth in the same periodical, Scientific American, in a subsequent issue, that of March 26, 1846. The image in the question was taken from the March 19th issue. "
What does a conductor actually do?,"A good conductor: At the top level of your question, indeed, there exist ensembles that perform without a conductor. These ensembles are often heavily rehearsed, and quite often the musical leadership (that is, who decides what to rehearse when) comes from a senior member of the ensemble. (Traditionally, the first violin/concertmaster.1) However, once this is rehearsed, it is pretty much set in stone, and there is very little a large conductorless ensemble can change in the middle of a performance. But keep in mind, high-level performing ensembles often do not have copious rehearsal time! Usually, just one session, and not uncommonly zero, before a performance. In these situations it is imperative to have someone at the front who will unify all of the different musicians' interpretations of the piece in question. Furthermore, the music in the moment of performance will often require something different than what is rehearsed. The tempos might be a little bit faster, or the brass might give a bit more (or god forbid someone makes a mistake), and the conductor is there to take all of this information and synthesize it into the ensemble's performance. The simple fact that the same orchestra will sound different with a different conductor should be proof enough of this. The conductor is constantly asking himself ""What information does the ensemble need from me?"", answers that question using his ears and his internal aural image of what the music should sound like, and then executes a gesture to communicate this information nonverbally. At high levels of ensemble musicianship, the conductor may not even need to move his hands, if the music doesn't require it! See this video of Leonard Bernstein, but do realize that he is communicating and influencing the ensemble even without his hands! Of course, at lower levels of musicianship, like in a middle school, the players are likely going to need very specific beat patterns to play together, even after copious amounts of rehearsal. 1 Even in professional orchestras, it is still this first violin who makes many of the ensemble decisions like, ""where, really, is our first downbeat."" Many famous orchestra conductors are notorious for being very nonspecific with their opening gestures, and were the cameras trained a little down and to the left, you'd see the real preparatory gesture."

Will learning to play another instrument help me to become a better guitarist?,Learning another instrument will not necessarily make you a better guitarist; since the time spent learning another instrument is time that your spending not building your technical ability on the guitar. It will however probably make you a better overall musician; since playing/learning a different instrument encourages you to think about your preferred instrument differently; and will probably give you a better idea of how they fit together musically.   There are many guitarists who have got ideas for their own playing by analysing the music of players of other instruments.  Actually learning another instrument is a natural extension of that.
A (440 Hz) and A (880 Hz) are completely different sounds to me. Does this mean I'm tone deaf?,"Note: For the physics and neurophysiology covered in this answer I am going to be oversimplifying for brevity. They are not the ""same"" but they have the same pitch class. Notes that sound similar are said to have the same pitch chroma and the collection of all these notes are said to be in a pitch class. The octave, however, does differ in pitch height because 440 Hz and 880 Hz are not the same frequencies. The property you are referring to in your question is called octave equivalence. If you want a color analogy, maroon and red are clearly not the same color (different wavelengths) but they do have the same hue. Let's first note that the octave has circularity (the new scale is perceived to begin again at the next octave) and that this appears to be a universal feature in all music of all cultures. This highly suggests that it is a matter of neurophysiology and not cultural. Furthermore, this property has been observed in monkeys. There are a few possibilities for why this occurs: 1) Physics explanation: Note that the two pitches share harmonics in common. A sound at 440 Hz also includes 880 Hz as the next harmonic. If you continue the pattern for 440 Hz and 880 Hz you will see that they share a large overlap in common overtone frequencies. Due to the frequency overlap between the harmonics of the two notes, there is a large similarity in the overall sound of the two notes. 2) Neurophysiological explanation: The brain has representative ""maps"" that are reconstructed from data given to it about the world. So for the auditory system there is a ""map"" of the 3-d space in which sounds are represented in different areas by different neurons firing in the brain that preserves their approximate location. Oversimplified: Two sounds that are nearby might activate a cluster of neurons that are near each other, thus preserving proximity within the brain. This happens in the auditory cortex with what is a called a tonotopic map, but it is apparent now that the octave itself is mapped in the brain in an area that feeds into the cortex called the thalamus. Unlike the map in the auditory cortex, which is used for sound localization, the thalamic map appears to identify octaves. In a subsection of the thalamus, a note at 440 Hz, 880 Hz, and 1760 Hz would activate a layer of neurons that are an equal distance apart, forming a kind of octave map. These inputs are then combined together when they leave the thalamus (rather than being maintained as separate, distinct inputs) to be interpreted by the cortex. Essentially the brain is lowering the complexity of a signal in multiple octaves by condensing it into a single octave. These results were first seen in rabbits. There have been a couple studies showing this in humans, here is one of them. This suggests that the brain thinks they are similar enough and the thalamus is organized to reflect this. There is still work to be done in this area, but the evidence so far is highly suggestive of the idea that octave equivalence is in determined by our brains. Conclusion: You're not crazy. They are not the same pitch. But the representation in the brain means that the sounds are pooled so that they are perceived as having a similarity. This is because they share an overlap in harmonics which the brain recognizes and maps as well. So perhaps it is better to say that the two pitches are similar but not the same. Edit: I have changed the paragraph in the physics explanation to reflect the comments by topo morto."
Why does string strummed with finger sound different from the one strummed with pick?,"Per a suggestion, I am converting my comment into an answer. (uh-oh, it looks like Music.SE doesn't support MathJAX -- I am going to go ahead and post the TeX code anyway and try to explain it in plain english along the way.  I also added a meta request to see if we can't fix the MathJAX problem.) Discounting the inharmonicity due to the bending stiffness of the string, and discounting the damping behavior, the behavior of a guitar string can be modeled as a one-dimensional initial value problem (partial differential equation in space and time with boundary and initial conditions).  In english:  First line: The acceleration of any particular bit of string is proportional to the local curvature.   Second line: The two ends of the string are fixed. Third line: At the moment of release, the string is pulled to some particular shape. Fourth line: The string is simply pulled to a shape and released -- the ""plucker"" does not impart any velocity to the string (i.e., you are pulling and letting go, not ""throwing"" or ""pushing"" the string). The solution to this equation cannot really be written in a closed form for a bounded problem.  Instead, the behavior generally consists of a linear combination of eigenfunctions, which are of the form  If either you can see through this TeX code or Music.SE enables MathJAX, those who are mathematically inclined should recognize this as simply a weighted sum of the harmonics of the fundamental frequency $c$. The sound you hear is simply a function of the different $k_n$ values (where $n$ is the number of each harmonic).  Those values are simply the Fourier coefficients of the initial shape of the guitar string at the exact moment of release. I'll spare you the math on these, but in general, the rule of thumb is that the ""pointier"" the initial shape, the higher the $k_n$ values are for large values of $n$ and the more brilliant the sound.  The rounder the shape, the smaller those values are and the duller the sound. Simply put, the pick is stiffer than your finger, and it comes to a sharper point than your finger does.  If you look at the initial shape at the exact moment of release, the picked string is going to come to a sharper point than a finger-plucked string.  The $k_n$ rules above then apply, and the rest is just math. Thick guitar strings will have an inharmonicity term proportional to the fourth spatial derivative of the displacement.  This severely complicates the appearance of the solution, the end result of which is that higher level harmonics are not exact multiples of the fundamental frequency.  For the purposes of answering this question, this is immaterial. There are also damping terms proportional to the velocity of the string (first time derivative of displacement) for viscous damping, and proportional to the square of the velocity of the string for aerodynamic damping.  The general effect of these terms is that each harmonic's $k_n$ value fades to zero over time, with higher harmonics fading faster than lower harmonics.  Again, for the purposes of answering this question, this is immaterial."
(1/√π)/√⅔ as a time signature?,"I think the author of that Wikipedia page has rather misinterpreted Nancarrow's title page for the Study (linked on Roland Bouman's comment to the question). (1/√π)/√⅔ refers to a tempo ratio between two voices, not a time signature. Nancarrow was rather obsessed with canons. The canon is a form where multiple voices each play the same music at some time offset (i.e. the second voice enter a bar after the first). Nancarrow wrote tempo canons where the voices are at various tempo ratios growing more and more complex over his career. The Study for Player Piano No. 41 is structured in 3 movements, 41A and 41B are two voice canons and 41C is both 41A and 41B played together.
41A has a tempo ratio of (1/√π)/√⅔, which is what the Wikipedia page mentions. This does not refer to a time signature, a regular grouping of beat stressing, but to the ratio between the two voices in the canon. So, for example, if the first voice was at ♩=100, the second would be at ♩= 100 * (1/√π)/√⅔ ≈ 69.098829894267098 41B is in a similarly ridiculous ratio of (1/(π^1/3)) / ((13/16)^1/3) and the final movement Nancarrow notates as having a ratio of 41B/41A = [(1/(π^1/3)) / ((13/16)^1/3)] / [(1/√π)/√⅔] The article Roland Bouman mentions has much more detail and analysis of what Nancarrow actually intended by these numbers, and how precise he was actually intending to be. The most interesting section, especially for those noting how pretentious such notation is (which I think is an accurate observation) is a quote from Nancarrow about how he picked the ratio: At that time [of the composition of Study No. 41], I was looking for some irrational relationships. I had this book of engineering, and I looked up some relations that were roughly what I wanted. I didn’t want something that was so separated they didn’t even relate, or too close that you couldn’t hear it. I found that those particular numbers, transferred into simple numbers, gave the proportion more or less that I wanted. Not exact, but near enough. This was before I had written a note. and the author's commentary: Of course, by their very definition, irrational numbers cannot be specified; in order to have produced the Study Nancarrow had to approximate the proportions. Why not, then, simply use the rational equivalents? Part of the attraction must have been the gorgeous complexity of the original proportional structure. For a lover of numbers like Nancarrow, the proportion is a thing of beauty. And, of course, π means something even to the lay person: it is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. Nancarrow gives no indication, however, that he had anything grander in mind than simply finding ""some relations that were roughly what I wanted.” "
Have orchestras included any modern instrument lately?,"The biggest thing to understand about an Orchestra is that they operate ""at a loss"". To have a successful orchestra, you need to be able to have donors, ticket sales, and subscriptions.  Donors make up the most of the monetary substance. Subscriptions come in second, and ticket sales dead last.  On the other end (money out), you need to pay staff, musicians, and such for time to practice, perform, and hone their skills. Being a professional orchestra level musician is a life style more then anything else. So now you have a large money in, large money out ""business"" that makes no money itself. Most orchestras struggle just to ""survive"", but even ""thriving"", can mean just breaking even. So, the question becomes, what do you need to be able to play the most varied selection of music? Would you donate $10,000 to an orchestra that couldn't play ""Beethoven's 5""? How about one that couldn't play Opening theme from Star-Wars? What about something like Vivaldi's Four Seasons? Ok so now you have a pretty set list of players you need to pay. You have your strings, your percussion, your brass, and you wood-winds.  Now, be need a Trumpet player. Guess what there's a lot of those so we can afford 4 trumpets at around $70k each. The better ones more, the less skilled less, but averaging around $70k.  We should have some french horns. Hmm there staring around $100k on the low end. Arrg. Ok let's get 1. Now lets get an oboe player. Lots of those again, They start around $62k. Lets get 4.    You know what. I want to play a piece from Zelda, Link's awakening.  I need an ocarina player. Hmm, well theres only 3 of those in the whole world, and the only one that wants a full time gig wants $1,200k a year. Hmmm, let's re-write the ocarina part for clarinet. WOOT $36k a year. Still only need one, but wow was that better then $1,200k. And so on.  Most pieces call for a similar set of instruments. Pieces that call for ""special"" instruments can be arranged to not need them. Thus I don't have to pay for a full year just to play 1 piece.  If this year's schedule calls for 30 different pieces, and they all have the same instrumentation, that's great. If 29 pieces have the same instrumentation, and 1 piece  needs something special, then maybe I should rethink that one piece.  In the real world, most pieces have mostly the same instrumentation. It's generally close enough to pay for the 4th trumpet to just play the 3rd part with the 3rd instrument on the 4 pieces that only have 3 parts. But an odd/new instrument that's only around for one piece? What are they supposed to do the rest of the time? This is even more true if the piece the new instrument plays is part of a concert that is only given once or twice a year.  Including this player in the orchestra becomes a waste of money. Better to just contract them out for that one performance. However doing so could be  very expensive.  So while an orchestra may not actively avoid having new instruments. It also doesn't make a lot of sense to have a player on the books that isn't going to perform in many pieces. Better to have them as a ""guest"" then a ""member"".  That said, most orchestras are more then willing to have ""new"" instruments that are replacements for old ones. But an electric violin, doesn't sound the same as an ""acoustic"" one. Sound is everything in music, so.... Would you want to listen to a MIDI keyboard over a Grand Piano? No, totally new instruments simply wouldn't get enough playtime to be worth the cost, while new version of old instruments are more accepted, they also don't sound the same, and that's important. Combined, it means that orchestra companies tend to favor the same (rigid) set of instruments. "
"Is there a ""standard"" or ""typical"" drum kit layout?","Your description at the end is pretty close to the default (assuming right handed) for a rock kit, which is the most commonly used setup. There are other standard kit setups such as Jazz Kits see @Eric K's answer for a description of a Jazz kit. So for a ""standard"" rock kit you'd have: Also you'll have the middle toms and snare angled slightly towards with the cymbals at a much more aggressive angle towards you. The positioning & height of the toms allows for good runs up and down the kit and is somewhat in line with their relative positions on a musical score - or that's how I see them when I look at a score. This is a good visual representation of the heights & positions:  Once drummers get more experienced you'll see more crash, splash etc. cymbals of various sizes and other bits and pieces popping up on their kits but the above is the usual starting point for a rock kit."
Is there a standard width for piano keys?,"This question got me curious, so I started googling. Keyboard size is not officially standardized (there is no committee creating and enforcing standards), but in practice, there is very little variation.  Browsing through forum topics on www.pianoworld.com, people measured 88 key keyboards from anywhere between 48 inches to 48 1/2"". Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_keyboard) describes the width of an octave on a modern keyboard as 164-165 mm, which leaves almost a centimeter variation in width over the entire keyboard. There is also the option of buying a deliberately manufactured smaller keyboard, as described at http://www.smallpianokeyboards.org/keyboard-history.html. This would have a width as small as 141 mm for an octave, or over 2 cm smaller than a standard. I don't play piano, but as a small handed woman, that sounds pretty attractive. Historically, from both the wikipedia and the smallpianokeyboards.org sites, older keyed instruments had octave widths as small as 125 mm, but not modern pianos.  For piano-like instruments, such as midi-controllers and cheap electronic keyboards, smaller keys are common when manufacturers have goals other than producing a standard piano."

Which notes are optional in jazz chords?,"In classical theory, the necessity or lack thereof of a particular chord member is generally determined by the note's tendency to lead to another note.  That tendency comes most often from the interval of an augmented fourth or diminished fifth.  Enharmonically, those intervals are the same, but in context, they are not, and they resolve differently.  In a ""dominant seventh"" sonority, the third and seventh of the chord form a diminished fifth if the third is below the seventh, or an augmented fourth if the third is above the seventh.  In the diminished fifth, the upper note resolves down by step, and the lower note resolves up by step.  In the augmented fourth, the upper note resolves up by step, and the lower note resolves down by step.  What this means for the dominant seventh is that scale degree seven, the ""leading tone,"" resolves up to tonic, and the chordal seventh, scale degree four, resolves down to scale degree three.  Scale degrees one and three strongly imply the tonic chord of the key, so there is a feeling of resolution.  In other seventh chords, the seventh still resolves down by step.  It is possible in the dominant seventh to omit the root without changing the function of the chord.  Often, then, what would have been the lowered ninth is added, providing another diminished fifth or augmented fourth (against the fifth of the chord).  If I had a convenient way to draw all this out on a staff right now, I would. In jazz, we don't always resolve chordal sevenths.  However, we still hear the tendencies toward resolution as defining of chordal quality.  Further, there are dissonances within chords that we do not necessarily want to sound, as you have pointed out.  In those cases, we will keep the note that is more responsible for defining the chord quality (usually).  So, in your examples: Note that your assertion of two notes being insufficient to represent a chord is inaccurate.  Two-voice baroque counterpoint has clear harmonic progression throughout.  The same rules apply when the chords are simpler than those you list.  For example, in a major or minor triad, the fifth is not necessary.  In a dominant seventh sonority, the third and seventh are necessary (as the tendency tones), while the root and fifth can be omitted. Of course, if you are playing in an ensemble, other instruments may have chord members that you do not, then, need to double.  Finally, if you are performing with a soloist, it is best to avoid using the chord tones that the soloist is using.  It will be nearly impossible to do so in an improvised solo setting, but if you are accompanying a known melody line, this principle can guide your voicing choices. I am not a guitarist, but I hope this perspective generally has been helpful.  As on all instruments, technical convenience (or necessity) may guide your choices quite often as well.  Don't feel the need to include too many notes, though; sometimes doing so just makes the texture ""muddy.""  Let your ears be your guide."
Do advanced musicians still practice scales every day?,"My father was a French horn player for the New York Phil and later the Pittsburgh Symphony. It was a rare day when he didn’t go down to the basement and play a series of scales and arpeggios, sometimes for extended periods. I talked to him about it, but years ago so I can’t tell you if the following thoughts are his or mine: There’s a lot of repetition in music. If you’re getting paid to play a set, you’d better find what you love about that set, or you’ll burn out. I think practicing the fundamentals is a way of setting your mind to the task of getting past the mere rote of practice and finding the infinite depth within. When you play a complex piece, there’s always something to work on right at the surface–a difficult passage, some dynamics, some phrasing. But when you play fundamentals you focus on deeper stuff: pure tone, vibrato, subtle intonation choices, etc."
Does it really make difference to play a song in a different key?,"Music, as an art, is in the ear of the listener. As a musician, I can say there are definitely times when a song sounds ""better"" in one key than another. The primary reason this is so is when the key fits the ""natural"" range of a singer or instrument. A song may sound perfect when sung by a female alto, but as those notes sung verbatim would be at the top of a male vocalist's range or, if transposed, the very bottom, it would very likely sound ""off"" (regardless of subject matter) if sung by a male in the original key, because you will hear the strain in his voice, or the timbre changes as he moves from his chest voice into either his head voice or to pedal tones. Transposed down a fifth into a new key, the song would sound much better when sung by a male singer. The same applies in reverse. In other cases, such as stringed instruments like guitars, there is a mixture of convenience and of chord voicing. Guitars, because of the tuning of their open strings, have a few ""natural"" keys, like G and D, in which the most common chords heard in a song of that key (I,ii,iii,IV,V,vi) are easy to play. Also, because of the tuning intervals between strings and the subsequent natural spacing of notes in guitar chords, the playing of a song in a different key often necessitates the use of chord fingerings which produce alternate voicings; a different note in the chord will be on bottom and on top, and different notes will be next to each other. This can definitely make a song sound better or worse depending on key. Even in cases of instruments like pianos, where theoretically the instrument has the same timbre across the entire instrument and the same chord voicing can be played just as easily in any key, there are changes in timbre as the pitch changes. This is due to differences in construction across the same instrument (a piano for example goes from one to two and three wound strings, and then to three monofilament strings, for each key of the keyboard as you move from left to right) and due to simple physics (for instance, as notes increase in pitch, we hear less of the harmonic overtones produced as they pass beyond 40kHz, and conversely, as pitch decreases and heads toward the subsonic range, the frequency difference in notes and thus our ability to perceive said difference diminishes). This may lead to a song sounding better in a lower (or higher) key for reasons that may not be explainable at the time."
The major scale - why and how?,"tl;dr The simple answer is ""The major scale comes from the overtone series."" I don't know the history, which I suspect goes something like ""the major scale is that way because people liked the sound of it.""  But I do know the mathematics, which may help to explain why people like the sound of it. Let's start from first principles, many of which you probably already know.  To begin with, sound is vibration.  We perceive sound through the vibration of the eardrum and the tiny bones (the hammer, anvil, and stirrup) in our ears.  Most commonly, we hear vibrations in the air, although when we speak, our own heads also vibrate, contributing to the sound we perceive as our own voices---this is why our voices sound different to ourselves than to other people and why most people don't like the recorded sound of their own voice. So a note in its purest form is some vibration at some frequency, measured in Hertz (Hz).  For example, by convention in the United States, orchestras tune to a pitch at 440 Hz (an A). Now, when we say that a pitch has a certain frequency, like A is 440 Hz, that's mostly a theoretical simplification.  Most sounds aren't composed of a single frequency.  If you sing an A or play an A on a trumpet or a violin, the resulting sound is actually composed of multiple frequencies simultaneously---the fundamental frequency (the 440 Hz) and a series of related frequencies known as the overtone series.  Which members of the overtone series are present, and in what proportions, determines the timbre (or tone quality) of the sound.  It's what makes the voice sound different from the trumpet and the violin.  So again, when we hear a sound, we are most often hearing a collage of related frequencies. What is the overtone series?  The frequencies that make up the overtone series are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency.  In the case of A440, the overtone series includes 880 Hz, 1320 Hz, 1760 Hz, 2200 Hz, 2640 Hz, ....  Taking octave equivalence into consideration, we can generate closely-related frequencies within an octave of 440 Hz: All of these frequencies are present in the overtone series, and so they occur naturally, to varying degrees, when you play an A.  Contrast these frequencies with the frequencies for the major scale pitches in Equal Temperament: Pretty close, right?  And in fact, Equal Temperament is a relatively recent compromise developed in response to issues like this.  The point is: the notes of the major scale come from the naturally-occurring overtones present in sound."
Why do Guitar chords work the way they do compared to a Piano?,"Yes, you're right, it is like playing some extra notes on the piano. Note that when your friend plays a C major chord, he probably plays 5 strings (but for other chords, e.g. the G major, it might be 6). The guitar strings will be playing the following notes: a middle C, a middle E, a middle G (the same notes as you are playing on the piano) plus a high C and a high E. You can play those last two notes on the piano as well with your other hand to hear the difference. Due the nature of musical tones, whenever you play, say, a middle C, you hear not only the fundamental frequency of the middle C, but also higher harmonics, one of them being the high C. Therefore, higher tones will (usually) not change the 'essence' of the chord (but they can add to the 'richness')."
What are some chord substitutions for a I-IV-V blues progression?,"There are a ton of easy and great-sounding substitutions, and you can use them in the turnaround or anywhere else you want.  Here are a few of the most common: Some of these substitutions sound better in a jazz context than a pure blues context, but either way they'll spice up your playing.  Also, the same principles apply to your soloing: for example, if you're soloing over a G7, feel free to play a D♭ pentatonic or mixolydian scale, which will still sound good but add a bit of unexpected color."
I accidentally composed a song that sounds like a famous song,"What do you mean by 'rhythm progression?' If you mean just the chord progression (the chord chart I found online shows Am G D Am for the verses) that wouldn't be unique enough to be a copyright violation. If the melody also is too similar to the Tom Petty song, you have a potential copyright problem. When you describe it as the same as Mary Jane's Last Dance, but with different lyrics, I imagine your melody is too similar to the Tom Petty song. I have a quote somewhere (see edit below) that makes this point: a dilettante is unwilling to revise their work and a true composer is willing to change their ideas and explore possibilities. In that spirit I suggest applying all the techniques you can to modifying what you produced. Some of the results may seem forced, but going through the process is the important part. If you try these things with the Tom Petty song, it will probably all sound lame, because you will be effectively destroying a cool song. That's probably how it will feel. But the processes and judging the results are the main point. Do any alternatives work? Would they work with a different lyric if the song mood has changed too much? Try it, keep what works, then move on. Hopefully in the future you will notice sooner when you are recreating an existing song and steer it in a different direction before you are fully committed to an idea. EDIT: Below is a scan of a notebook page I cut and pasted (the old fashioned way with paper, scissors, and tape) of a quote from Seigmeister, Harmony and Melody along with an transcription from a Beethoven sketchbook of five edits for a string quartet theme. I put this together for myself for inspiration. "
"Why isn't there a classical composer like Beethoven, Chopin or Mozart today? [closed]","I believe two factors are at play here: In its day, classical music was tied in to the main influence structures of society: nobility, and the church.  This meant that classical composers who made it in the day were akin to Michael Jackson or The Beatles today. Becoming a part of the influence structures at the time was hugely difficult, and very few had the means to do it.  Mozart for example was fortunate enough to be taken round royal courts from a young age along with his sister, almost as a novelty.  But through that exposure - along with his talent, a lot of work from his father, and possibly the fact that he was male - he was able to cultivate his talents in front of the influencers that made him a cultural icon of the day. In metaphoric terms, imagine a small X-factor panel decided what was worth sharing, and nothing else got through.  That panel was the nobility and the church, and Mozart was Susan Boyle. It's no coincidence that Mozart and Beethoven were around the same time, because classical music for its beauty is a genre based on harmonic rules.  Both Mozart and Beethoven had access to the people who not only defined those rules, but expanded upon them (Notably Haydn and Bach). One of the advantages of a set of rules is that you can work within them to make increasingly elaborate and beautiful examples. The reason there was a set of rules ties largely into the church's views on music, but what's important is that they don't apply anymore. Nowadays, you don't simply have a genre of music that's worked on and elaborated.  You have tens of thousands.  What was once a giant pile of influence is now a thousand little piles. Most genres have what you'd consider their own Mozarts. Some names immediately come to mind if I say say Pop, Country, Progressive Rock, Dubstep, Jazz, Time Lord Rock (Okay maybe not Time Lord Rock).  But they're all big fish in smaller ponds.  The splitting of a preferred music genre into a thousand smaller genres means that there are a thousand separate rule-sets, and divisions people who love them. -- Some people love Michael Jackson's Music; some hate it.  For the ones who hate it there are thousands of other artists and genres. How can one flavour of composer arise when all tastes are catered for?"
Why are some people so paranoid about music theory?,"tl;dr People don't like it because they don't actually know what it is. There has been and will always be a stigma against music theory and studying it. Some of the reasons I've heard on this very site are: There are many more arguments and while I could counter each and every one, it outlines a problem that needs to be addressed. The biggest problem is people don't understand what music theory is. People take or see an intro music theory where your hand is being held to learn and compose a certiant style and it scares most people away without them seeing a bigger picture.  Music Theory in the simplest is the study of what works and what doesn't in music and mainly focuses on tools that help you get there by dissecting a piece of music. The tools that you are given help by formal Music Theory really help in this aspect with the only flaw being they are specifically geared for a specific era of music and while it lines up pretty well with most current ones, it's not a exact. The theory itself won't tell you if it sounds good or bad to you, but it will give you the tool and terminology needed for you to find if in a more objective way. So while there is a formal path for studying the subject, simple things like someone listening to a song and figuring out what you like and what you don't is also music theory. Every musician I know does this even the ones that speak out against theory, just the ones without theory have a much more round about way to get there/describe it. Most people only equate music theory to an intro class that focuses on the classical era which most modern types of western music are rooted in, but there is so much more. There are pop, jazz, blues, and rock music theory classes and books that focus much more on modern songs and deconstructing them so people can learn what works and what doesn't and even focuses on slightly different types of analysis that are better geared for them. People who study music theory in depth eventually tailor their ideas towards what they find works and what doesn't using what they learned as a foundation for this and utilizes this in what they compose. This to my knowledge is the only subject that has this problem. Even in other artistic fields like film and art the study is extremely important and no one complains about that affecting the artistic value or creativity of them. "
How do you identify a good acoustic guitar?,"What should I be looking for? Don't look, listen and touch. Too many poor guitar purchases are made when you shop with your eyes and not ears and your hands. Here is my general advice for buying a guitar, stands for acoustic or electric: Do you guys have any suggestions? Yup: play everything you can! Be ""that guy"" at the music store who's asking every guitar to be taken down for a quick spin. Especially if you're new to guitar, you don't really know what you like the sound of or what feels good in your hands. The only way you can remedy that shortcoming is to get experienced and the only way to get experienced is...well, you know the answer to that now. :)"
Glossary of Guitar Effects,"Delay is an effect in itself, and also the basis of some of the other effects1. Delay is simply the effect of playing the input signal some time later than it was fed into the device. Delays can be as short as a couple of milliseconds, as long as a bar, or more. Usually, but not always, the delayed signal is combined with the original signal, because players want to hear what they play the moment they play it. Often it is mixed such that the original signal is louder than the delayed signal. Originally delay was achieved using a loop of magnetic tape - first on improvised arrangements with a reel-to-reel recorder, and later on dedicated machines. The tape would pass through a recording head, then a playback head, then an erase head. The timing of the delay could be adjusted by moving the heads, or changing the speed of the tape. Tape adds its own colour to sound, so the echo would have that added warmth. Later, analogue circuits were developed to achieve delay, first with tubes, then with transistors, each of these adding a certain colour to the delayed signal. Digital delay inevitably followed, and of course, now we have digital delays which attempt to model the effects of the analogue devices of history. When the delay is very short, the signals tend to interfere with each other in interesting ways -- see Phaser and Flanger. When the delay is slightly longer -- close enough to still be considered ""on the beat"" -- you get what is known as doubling echo. This sounds similar to having two instruments playing in unison. The delay is simulating the slight difference in timing two human players would have. Chorus is a variation on doubling echo, in which the delay varies -- the tape loop speeding up and slowing down continually. This means your ""virtual"" duet partner is slightly off time by a varying amount, and also slightly off-pitch by a varying amount. See the separate answer on chorus. When the delay is longer still -- long enough that you begin to be able to hear it as a distinct note -- this is known as slapback echo. It's an effect frequently heard in rockabilly guitar and the ""skanking"" guitar parts of reggae. When the delay is even longer, delay becomes a melodic tool -- you are effectively duetting with your earlier self. Many U2 songs, e.g. ""Where the Streets Have No Name"", are built around this effect. It's common to feed the delayed signal back into itself so that you get echoes of echoes, each (usually) quieter than the last. Using this fed-back delay on short delays creates a crude reverb effect. With longer delays, it becomes a rhythmic/melodic effect. For example, it's common to add delay to parts of drum patterns to create a complex rhythm part. With analogue delay (and simulations thereof), each subsequent echo is not only quieter, but also more distorted. Dub reggae tracks often make prominent use of this effect -- look out for the effect where the engineer momentarily turns a knob so that the echoes get louder instead of quieter, surging and distorting before he turns it back down again so they can die away. 1Note that no signal processing is instantaneous, so every effect adds some small delay. For digital effects, this is the measurable and sometimes notable latency of something millisecond-ish (hopefully not more than a few ms). In simple analogue effects like distortion it's at most in the nanosecond range and basically neglectable. Any equaliser/filter component also introduce phase delay, which can be interpreted as delaying various frequencies by different amounts; but this too is normally not noticeable and works quite differently from a digital delay."
Does 3/4 time signature differ from 6/8?,"Actually, in terms of fractions, 3/4 is the same as 6/8. But time signatures are not fractions. 3/4 means each bar has 3 notes of 1/4 each. 6/8 means each bar has 6 notes of 1/8 each. And yes, the difference is in the way you count it: In 3/4 you count 1,2,3 and in 6/8 you count up to 6 and the notes are shorter. The accents change as well; 6/8 is an even signature while 3/4 is odd; you usually emphasize the first beat of each measure in 3/4 while in 6/8 you could emphasize beats 1-3-5, or just 1 and 4 (which ends up feeling like triplets), or 2-4-6..."
Guitar practice: more often but less time or once in a few days but for a few hours?,"What's better: pick up a guitar every day for a few minutes or play more rarely, but having a longer session? Neither. It's not length of time, but what you do with it when you have it. If you spend your time playing the same three songs over and over again, you'll not likely improve save to be able to play three songs endlessly. That's a simplification, but it serves to illustrate a point. If you're not spending your time working on things that you have trouble with, or working with tools and methods that help you improve, whether you do it for 10 minutes or 10 hours doesn't really matter. Lets say you have an hour to dedicate to practicing (as opposed to just playing) your instrument, here is how I would suggest you break it down: Always with a metronome all of it. The combination of continually stretching your knowledge and your technique and the use of devices like a metronome to ensure you're performing consistently and measuring your success so you can push your limits on the next practice session are what yield results fast."
"What are the differences between tone, note, and pitch?","A pitch is a particular frequency of sound, for example 440 Hz.  Wikipedia goes into a lot of detail about how pitch is subjective, and frequency is objective; the frequency that you think you hear (the pitch) might not be the real frequency at all, due to overtones (see below) and other factors.  You can read that article for more details, though for our purposes the definition as ""a particular frequency"" is sufficient. A note is a named pitch. Arbitrarily named, of course, by us humans.  For example, Western music generally refers to the 440 Hz pitch as A, specifically A4.  A note can refer to an occurrence of such a pitch as well.  Playing A4 twice can either be talked about as ""playing one note twice"" or ""playing two notes"", depending on the context and how specific you want to be.  Notes that are even multiples of other notes share the same name; for example, 880 Hz (double 440 Hz) is also called A, specifically A5. As Kos points out in the comments, a note can also carry temporal information.  For example, given the same tempo, a whole note is held twice as long as a half note, which is in turn held twice as long as a quarter note, etc. When a sound consists of multiple pitches is when things get slightly messy.  If a sound consists of multiple pitches, it could either be multiple notes played at once or a single note with overtones (see my answer here for more information on overtones and harmonics).  You cannot determine the difference purely from the sound alone, you have to look at the actual physical action.  Striking two strings on  guitar will produce two notes; striking one will only produce one note, even if that single note consists of a fundamental frequency plus overtones. Timbre has to do with the other qualities of the sound.  Only a sound produced electronically can have only one pitch; all other sounds consist of multiple pitches.  The mix of frequencies in a sound results in the timbre.  For example, playing A4 on a guitar will actually result in a sound composed of the following frequencies: 440 Hz, 880 Hz, 1320 Hz, 1760 Hz, etc.  The particular strength, or amplitude, of the frequencies results in the timbre.  One sound might have very little 880 Hz present in it while another has a lot, for example, and we can pick up on that difference.  It's how we can tell that an A4 played on a piano and an A4 played on a guitar sound different. ""Tone"" is sometimes informally used as a synonym for ""timbre"", but more often ""tone"" is synonymous with ""note"".  It can basically replace ""note"" any time you would say ""note""; e.g. ""playing two tones"".  Some would argue that it more commonly refers to a single pitch — e.g. a note is a tone plus overtones, and a tone does not consist of overtones — but unfortunately the usage is inconsistent.  ""Tone"" can also be synonymous with ""step"": A half-tone is a half-step, and a whole-tone is a whole-step.  For example, from C to C# is a half step or half tone, whereas from C to D would be a whole step. I don't like to use the term ""tone"" because of the possible confusion about its meaning.  It's better to use timbre, pitch, note, or step when appropriate and leave tone out altogether."
Why is a C7 chord named a dominant seventh chord?,"It is so called because B♭ is the 7th note of the C dominant scale (also known as the Mixolydian scale). The 5th is known as the dominant, because it is the ""most important"" interval (among other things, it's the first harmonic other than the octave).  However, try to forget the ""English"" meaning of the word ""dominant"" -- otherwise you might expect C to be the ""dominant"" of C. It's not. In C, C is the ""tonic"". G, the 5th is the ""dominant"". Other intervals have names like ""subdominant"" (4th) and ""mediant"" (3rd) , which at least don't confuse you by having instinctive meanings. 5th relative to C is G. So since the C major scale is C,D,E,F,G,A,B, then the G dominant scale is G,A,B,C,D,E,F ... and the chord of G dominant 7th  is the triad plus the 7th from that scale - G,B,D,F The C dominant scale contains the same notes as F major, since C is F's 5th:  So the chord of C dominant 7th is C,E,G,B♭. Since in most Western music, major is the ""default"" scale, we might expect ""C7"" to denote C major 7th - C,E,G,B.  However in pop/rock/etc., the major 7th is relatively rare, and dominant 7ths are very common. Hence people organically settled on the convention of using ""C7"" to denote the dominant 7th and ""Cmaj7"" to denote a major 7th. "
"Why are pianos traditionally tuned ""out of tune"" at the extremes?","There are physical and psychoacoustics reasons behind it. A vibrating string held by its two extremities can only vibrate at certain frequencies (cycles per second, expressed in Hertz, i.e. 440 Hz = 440 cycles/second), which relates to the characteristics of the string (e.g. its weight per unit of length, its flexibility) and how it is used (e.g. the vibrating length — which is fixed by the instrument and the player; how much force is used to tense it — which is how you tune a stringed instrument). These are called partials. For an ideal string, that is a string which offers no resistance to being bent or rolled, there is a lowest frequency at which the string can vibrate, the fundamental; every other frequency at which the string can vibrate is a multiple of this frequency. These particular cases of partials are called harmonics. For example, the string of a middle A in the piano can vibrate at 440Hz, 880Hz = 2*440Hz, 1320Hz = 3*440Hz, 1760Hz, … When you hit the string with the hammer, the string typically vibrates with a combination of several of these frequencies. Now go an octave higher. The fundamental of that A is 880Hz, with harmonics at 1760Hz, 2640Hz, 3520Hz, … As you can see, the harmonics of the higher A all are harmonics of the lower A. Thus, they sound right together. In the middle range of the piano, its strings can pretty accurately be considered perfect and partials tend to be true harmonics. But if you go to the extreme range of the piano, it’s not the case any longer. The heavy string of the low notes can’t be rolled so easily (they are too large). This means that the partials are not harmonics any longer. For example (totally fictional and probably wildly inaccurate), the frequencies of a low A tuned to 55Hz could be 115Hz instead of 110Hz, 172Hz instead of 165Hz, … But this means that if you play a low 55Hz A with the A an octave higher, 110Hz, well, there is a 110Hz vibration (the higher A) and a 115 vibration (from the low A) at the same time. These conflict and you can hear that something is out of tune (you could hear a 5Hz beating, e.g.). To avoid this, the low A is tuned flat, let’s say at 52Hz, with partials (still fictional) at 110Hz, 167Hz, … Now when you play the low A alone? Its fundamental is at 52Hz, which your trained ear might perceive as a bit flat. But when you play both As together? Now there is way less conflict between their partials. They sound good together. Same with the high range on the piano: the very thin, highly constrained strings are far from an ideal string; their partials also are not true harmonics. So you tune them sharp (once again, to your trained ear) to ensure they sound good together with the lower strings."
What does a small x-like symbol before a note mean?,"I'm assuming that you're talking about the one that looks like a blocky X.....this is a double sharp.  Instead of shifting the tone up one half step, it shifts the tone up 2 half steps (i.e. 1 whole step).  This image shows G double-sharp in the treble clef, and E double-flat in the bass clef.  G double sharp is enharmonic with A natural, and E double-flat is enharmonic with D natural.  Coincidentally, Moonlight Sonata is the piece where I first encountered double-sharps, too!"
Why do instruments have a key?,"There are two concepts and ideas that happen in music which, when combined, explain why this happens.  The first is that the way certain instruments are constructed affects what sounds they can produce. The E♭ alto saxophone, the B♭ clarinet, and the horn in F each can easily play in the key designated. Typically, when learning to play these instruments the scales and pieces you would play would be in the key of the instrument. Those instruments can be constructed in other keys and sometimes are, but the popular key that they are built in tends to best take advantage of the timbre and the range of that instrument.  The second is that we tend to center the basics of what an instrument can play around C. So combined with the fact that instruments are built with one key being easier to play in than the others, it's common to call the easiest key to play in ""C"" even though it may not actually be C.  This may seem confusing, but there is one big advantage to doing this which is that someone who can play an instrument in a transposing family like the saxophone can keep the fingering the same in the notation. Wikipedia sums it up nicely: The instruments in these families have differing ranges, with the
  members sounding lower as they get larger; but an identical pattern of
  fingerings on two instruments in the same family produces pitches a
  fixed interval apart. For example, the fingerings which produce the
  notes of a C major scale on a standard flute, a non-transposing
  instrument, produce a G major scale on an alto flute. As a result,
  these instruments' parts are notated so that the written notes are
  fingered the same way on each instrument, making it easier for a
  single instrumentalist to play several instruments in the same family."
Why can't drums produce melody?,"Instruments don't just produce one frequency at a time. When you play a single note on a melodic instruments (like piano, wind instruments, string instruments, etc.), you produce many different frequencies at a single time--a whole spectrum is produced. But this spectrum isn't random. It pretty closely follows the harmonic series, which can be thought of as the ""ideal"" values that most appeal to our ear. When a single note is played, the higher, often fainter frequencies that are produced are called overtones. (To read more on those, check out my answer here.) When the overtones match the harmonic series, it sounds harmonious and we get the sensation of hearing a single note/pitch. Here's an example of a waveform produced by a flute:  http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Music/imgmus/fluw3.gif But when you strike a drum, the spectrum of frequencies deviates quite a bit from the harmonic series. Yes, there's often a single loudest frequency, but the overtones don't match what we expect to hear from a single-note/melodic instrument. As a result, our ears don't get the same sensation of hearing a single, defined pitch. It sounds more like a blunt collision than a defined note. For this reason, it would be much more difficult to recognize a melody on a drum than on a violin. This is called inharmonicity. A single strike on the timpani produces a spectrograph like this:  https://i2.wp.com/wtt.pauken.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Kolberg-Timpano-Spectrum.jpg?zoom=2&resize=389%2C301 According to hyperphysics, the timpani's overtones would theoretically would be these multiples of the lowest/fundamental frequency: 1, 1.35, 1.67, 1.99, 2.30, 2.61. This deviates quite a bit from the ideal-sounding harmonic series, where the overtones are integer multiples of the lowest/fundamental frequency. This might raise the question: why aren't the overtones of a drum harmonic? What physical quality of an instrument causes this inharmonicity? (Harmonic = integer multiple of the lowest/fundamental frequency.) It comes down to this: a vibrating circular membrane has an extra dimension within which it can vibrate compared to a 1D string or a 1D column of air. This extra dimension gives rise to both symmetric and asymmetric vibrations. For timpani, the symmetric vibrations all produce inharmonic frequencies which aren't integer multiples of the fundamental frequency. And only 5-6 of the asymmetric vibrational modes are harmonic. Those are called the ""preferred modes,"" and they're far and few between compared to the overtones of a melodic instrument. But beyond this, there's another logistical reason why drums aren't as well-suited for a melody as melodic instruments. Drums are tuned in advance of a performance and many can't really be re-tuned on the spot. However, there are jazz drummers who use a technique called ""melodic drumming."" One of the most well-known is Ari Hoeing. Here's a video from his YouTube channel of him playing You Are My Sunshine. You'll see him pushing down on the drums to increase the tension and produce a higher pitch. It's definitely recognizable, but perhaps compared to the saxophone, it's a little harder to distinguish the notes that the drums are playing. 

"
Why does the scale have seven (or five) notes? Why not six?,"I think your question is largely about the chosen notation for the Western system, which most answers haven't really addressed. The notation we have is actually pretty natural and logical, for a simple reason: there are twelve different notes in the Western system, but only a subset of these -- seven, in fact -- are used in a given scale such as the major scale. Let's use individual semitones as the basis for a notation as you suggest; so, let's say the note A is still denoted by A, but now A# (or Bb) is denoted by B, and then the remaining notes are C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, and L (twelve in total). I understand why you'd want to do this; it removes synonyms. But at what cost? What does an actual key look like now? Take C major as an example. In the new notation, the notes are D, F, H, I, K, A, C. This is confusing and hard to remember. Compare with C major in normal notation: C, D, E, F, G, A, B. It just cycles through the seven letters. What about other keys? Let's take F major as another example. I won't write it all out in the new notation again because you just get another confusing list of letters, but in normal notation, it's F, G, A, Bb, C, D, E. Hopefully now you see the benefit of this notation: it's easy to think about every key, because, ignoring accidentals (i.e. the flat on the B) they just cycle through our seven letters. You lose uniqueness of note names -- though in fact, not really in practice, for example you'd never call Bb ""A#"" when talking about the F major key -- and the usefulness of this feature of the notation far outweighs this minor problem."
What Does a Compressor Pedal Do?,"A compressor ""compresses"" the signal that your guitar produces by normalizing the dynamic range of the audio input signal based on a threshold value. This effect is used virtually everywhere in recording. Everything you hear in music that is produced today is compressed in some way--and it can sound anything from a subtle barely noticeable effect to a thick, dampened squish. The benefit of a compressor lies in that every note played will be at nearly the same amplitude, and therefore nearly equal in volume. This will help normalize tones that are sometimes lost in the mix because of complex overtones, and it will result in a more articulate sound. Notice that if you don't pick all notes of an arpeggio at exactly the same pressure you will likely get a different sound for each note, especially if you are playing a tube amp. Tube amplifiers react dynamically to stronger and weaker signals--it's the allure of them--and thus the non-uniformity of picking at different strengths will be exaggerated. A compressor will fix this problem and normalize all notes of the arpeggio regardless of the player's technique and equipment, which is consequently why many soloists prefer them. Compressors also have the ability to increase the sustain of notes beyond sounds that are normally usable on the instrument; yet another reason the effect is a popular tool in the soloist's arsenal. The tiniest signal can be normalized to the same amplitude of a fierce pick attack, and a trailing note will resonate at the exact same volume until the string stops inducing a signal on the pickup. Drawbacks of a compressor mirror their benefits. More expressive musical genres such as blues rely on the dynamics of the player. Picking technique and signal volume become part of the performance itself. In this case, a compressor will nullify exactly what you are trying to preserve. However, I have seen some blues guitarists use compressors so this is obviously not true universally.  Compressors also dampen the attack of plucking a string. This will make the note sound a bit squishy and with less snap. This is related to how fast the compressor reacts and normalizes the amplitude of the input signal. Slower reaction times result in a more natural uncompressed tone, while faster reaction times result in the trademark squishy sound. Some people consider the ""squishyness"" of a faster attack time a plus, while others don't like it. Nearly all compressors allow you to adjust this parameter, but it can never be completely transparent. You can get quite close with parallel compressor designs that blend the original signal into the affected signal, but the nature of the effect will still color the sound; that's what it's supposed to do."
How to know what notes will go together while improvising?,"Learning improvisation is a long trip.
Most people start with one of two ways: Soon you notice that it's not either one way or the other, it's a combination of both. Good improvisers are able to go either ways. If you want to go by ear, you need to know how the chords sound. You need to know the song's harmony by heart. Then you need to know how to play the notes that you are hearing in your head. To help you do that you can:  If you want to be able to play by the written chords, you can: When it comes to your second problem, do you mean improvising several tones at the same time? It would be wise to concentrate on improvising a monophonic melody first. That said, you need to learn how to spell chords (see above, learning what scale is associated with what chord) in order to know what combination of tones you can play on a given chord. It should be obvious, you need to know how to play the chord in order to play a chord based on it. To your last question. It's good that you can improvise if given the current key (here F major). There several reasons for other notes than that of F major being played in a song in F major: Now that you can play in the key of F, you should ask your friend to play a blues in F. Ask her to show you the scales associated with a 12-bar blues (F7, C7, G7), train on these scales, learn in what order they come and how long they last. Play along with her while she plays the chords. Or ask her to play the F blues, listen to the chords many many times, listen to many blues based songs (there are incredibly many), and play to her chords by ear. One good thing with blues is that you can play a single scale on the whole chord chart (the blues scale) and it sounds nice. But if you want to match chords, you can go on and learn which tones ""fit"" on one chord and not the other ones. Playing these tones at the right place makes things a bit more interesting. As a side note, if you hear that some tones you play do not sound good, then you are not tone deaf."
Key signature for writing in modes other than major and minor,"The convention generally follows that which we see for minor key signatures. There is not a 1 to 1 relationship of key signature to root, rather, the key signature is there to tell us what notes exist in the scale. Then, we use the music itself to figure out where the root is. If you were writing in D phrygian, for example, would you have two sharps in the key signature and then naturalize all Fs and Cs while flatting the Bs and Es? I should hope not, that would be confusing as all heck as far as I'm concerned. You would write two flats and be done with it. And yes, it's true, writing a natural key signature for G mixolydian could easily be confused for C major. OR for A minor. OR for F lydian, D dorian, or B locrian. We already have this convention for major and minor (i.e. Ionian and Aeolian), it's just that most people don't realize there are other possibilities. When they start seeing that in the music, they'll realize soon enough. The ""church modes"" as we know them, are the ones with the most background in western tonality, so I consider this convention to apply primarily to them. When you're talking about scales like super locrian or lydian dominant, there exists far less precedent. These most commonly occur in jazz music, where the key signature (if any) is most likely going to be a simple representation of overall major or minor key. The key signature matters less in this situation, since the scale/mode is going to be changing with the chords every bar or so anyway. Similarly, when you have scales that are less common in western common practice, like the Arabic scale, Ukrainian minor, what have you; there is little history of these being notated according to western traditional rules. In many cases the musical tradition would not be notated, or there would be an alternate system of notation. In contrast, the common usage of modes like mixolydian or dorian would be in a harmonically inactive setting. This lends itself to using one key signature for the entirety of the piece. If you're trying to notate non-western-traditional music, feel free to make up your own rules, but if you're using these types of scales in a jazz or highly harmonically active context, your key signature is probably not going to be directly related (should it exist at all)."
What to look for when buying a digital piano for a beginner?,"Digital pianos really have come a long way from where they were 15 years ago, when I started playing. I started on an unweighted 61-key touch-sensitive keyboard (touch-sensitivity is, by the way, essential, but implied on the weighted keyboards.  You cannot play classical piano music even remotely musically without touch sensitivity.  Organ music is a different story).  It's great for playing ""Mary had a little lamb"" and even ""Fur Elise"", but when you start hitting the more involved classical repertoire, you need to have weighted keys; it's simply too hard to play without the proper resistance.  It's impossible to play more advanced classical pieces on this keyboard, because you run out of keys.  The last major drawback was that it made playing on real pianos very difficult, since it doesn't let the student develop the musculature required for playing for long periods of time on a real piano (I'm only talking a half hour, here).  That's because while they're often used as such, unweighted 61-key keyboards are not designed for use by classical pianists; they're designed for use as synthesizers.  I still have this keyboard, and whenever I have to rock out a Katy Perry or a Taio Cruz, that's the instrument I turn to. I then bought a piano, but from the sounds of it, the piano itself and the upkeep are way too expensive at the moment.  I will say that I never bothered to keep it in tune (I've tuned it maybe 3 times in 10 years), and I regret that irresponsibility every day.  That being said, it still works!  The greatest drawback is the noise level; pianos are LOUD!  With keyboards, at least, you can pop in headphones, and it'll be mostly silent (you still have to deal with the thumping of the keys, but it's tolerable). My latest keyboard purchase was a Yamaha Portable Grand.  It's an 88-key fully weighted keyboard.  Keep in mind that fully-weighted is just what it means: it feels like a real piano and is heavy as anything (My estimate is 50-60 pounds; I feel that portable should have been in quotes on the packaging).  It sounds beautiful and never requires tuning.  This particular keyboard has something like 500 voices (which is actually useless; I never use anything except the stock piano voice, and occasionally an organ).  This is the sort of keyboard you'd want for advanced classical pieces.  The only major problem that I have with this particular keyboard is that the sustain does not last as long as in a real piano.  This leads to sloppy pedal work, which does require a little bit of concentration to adjust for.  The other minor issue is, as I mentioned before, the weight. It's worth noting that not all fully weighted keyboards are that much of a pain; I am in particular a fan of Casio's Privia line.  They're lighter, and I wish that I had picked that one up.  I have not played with them enough to be able to comment on whether or not they have the same issue with the sustain pedal (It took a year before I noticed it on my own keyboard). Finally, halfway between unweighted and fully weighted keyboards, you have half-weighted or semi-weighted keyboards.  I personally hate the action, but I hate it less than I hate unweighted keys.  I have successfully played somewhat intense classical pieces on them, and if it'll save a few hundred bucks on the cost of a new keyboard, it might be worth it.  When it comes to picking an action, make sure your wife plays it and likes how it feels; that really is the most important factor.  When I was buying a piano, my parents dragged me around to three or four warehouses full of pianos so that we could find one with an action that I liked.  (By the time I found a handful of good pianos, my fingers were very, very sore!) Lastly, you'll need to choose the number of keys your keyboard will have.  Your choices will include 44, 61, 76, and 88 keys.  More keys means harder to move (my 88-key keyboard is depressingly close to as tall as I am), but also means less technically limiting.  That being said, I don't think that I've ever used all 88 keys on my keyboard at once.  I will reiterate, though, with a 61-key keyboard, you will eventually run out of keys and it will make practicing advanced pieces harder. Make sure that you get a footswitch with your keyboard.  You will need them for pedaling on many, many pieces.  I don't believe that springing for a ""piano-style"" pedal will make a difference for beginners; it's mostly useful for half-pedaling, which is a technique that comes along later.  But there are a lot of inexpensive ones out there, so if you really want it, it won't hurt! It sounds really obvious, but also make sure that your keyboard comes with its own speakers!  Some professional keyboards will not have built-in speakers; they assume that you're going to use a keyboard amp, and so putting onboard speakers would add weight and complexity unnecessarily.  To clarify, you really don't need a keyboard amp at this stage of the game, so steer away from these keyboards. Good luck picking your keyboard.  If I've left something out, let me know!"
"What is the difference between a xylophone, a glockenspiel, a marimba, a xylorimba and a marimbaphone?","There are actually quite major differences:     There are also a range of other similar instruments, and all of the above have variants in terms of materials, tuning, shape etc."
"What's the difference between ""modal music"" and ""tonal music""?","""Modal"" and ""tonal"" both describe works that: The difference between modal and tonal are in the harmonic languages surrounding the tonal center.  Tonality implies the system of common-practice harmony well-established by the eighteenth century that uses major and minor keys.  The tonal center of a tonal work is the first note of the major or minor scale in use as the pitch collection.  The harmonic implications of tonality are more than just the use of major and minor scales, as functional harmony is also a feature of tonal music.  The progression from the dominant sonority (a major triad with or without a minor seventh from the triad root based on the fifth note of the major or minor scale in use, or a similar-sounding substitute such as a fully-diminished seventh chord based on the leading tone) to the tonic triad to end a work is just one characteristic of functional harmony.  This characteristic is so important that, if the dominant sonority is instead a minor chord (thereby lacking the leading tone), the work no longer sounds tonal.  This means that even in a minor key, the seventh note of the scale is very often raised so that it becomes the leading tone. Modal music uses diatonic scales that are not necessarily major or minor and does not use functional harmony as we understand it within tonality.  The term modal is most often associated with the eight church modes.  The tonal center of these modes is called its ""final.""  All the church modes use a pattern of half and whole steps that could be played on the white keys of a piano.  You may notice that there are only four different patterns among the church modes; the difference between e.g. ""dorian"" and ""hypodorian"" is whether the final occurs at or near the bottom of the melodic range or whether the final occurs in the middle of the melodic range.  The term ""modal"" has expanded in more modern music to encompass any non-tonal music that uses a diatonic pitch collection and has a tonal center. There are many types of music other than modal and tonal.  Some examples include: I did not even touch on music that does not use pitches at all; for example, an unpitched percussion work would clearly not be modal or tonal. There are entire books on functional harmony, modes, etc., but I hope this has been a reasonable summary to answer your question."
Why are orchestras tuned differently?,"It is often a matter of tradition inside the orchestra that becomes out of control for conductors. When they create their own orchestra they have the pleasure to decide this for themselves. The conservatism from musicians has several reasons: Some Orchestra have a concert hall with a large organ which is tuned for this frequency Wind players usually complain because refitting a wind instrument to a central tune can be expensive and dangerous. They have a certain capacity of adjusting the tone by technique and with wood especially they have to do it anyway because of temperature and moisture during a concert but it is easier to start from the reference they know. First players, old members and conductors with absolute pitch complain and use this as a power mean. An established orchestra's staff changes only gradually. New musicians are hired a few at a time. Musicians passing job interviews know about it and comply to get hired."
"In live performance, what is a ""monitor""","In many live music contexts, musicians have the problem of hearing themselves clearly. Typically when playing loud, musicians are positioned behind the main speakers (heard by the audience) to avoid feedback, and for the safety of their own ears. In that basic scenario, musicians only hear: This is far from ideal for the band members. On-stage, the guitar and drums might drown everything else out - but even they have to contend with delayed echoes from the back wall (in a large room) which throw their timing out. Acoustic instrumentalists and singers can't hear themselves at all. One solution to this is to have speakers on stage, facing the band members. These speakers are quieter than the main speakers, but loud enough to let the band hear a clear version of what they need to hear. This is called monitoring, and the speakers used are called monitor speakers or just monitors. One very simple case for a small electric guitar band in a small venue, is for guitarists to simply monitor from their own amps, and for the vocalist to have a monitor through which they hear only vocals. From there, the sky's the limit for complexity. A bigger band will have a separate mix to be heard on stage - often with fewer effects applied, so musicians can hear exactly what they're doing. The most sophisticated setups may have a separate mix for each musician, so each one can hear a mix tailored for their particular needs. Any speaker placed for the purpose of the musician hearing their own performance is a monitor. However some speakers are specially designed for the purpose of stage monitoring. For example, many are made in a wedge shape, designed to be positioned at the musician's feet, projecting sound up at them.  Although usually quieter than main speakers, there is still a danger of feedback from monitors, and so care has to be taken in positioning them, and in positioning microphones. An advantage of the wedge position is that a vocal microphone is typically pointed directly away from the monitor speaker. Purpose-made monitors often have built-in EQ facilities, which can be used to prevent feedback. One alternative, or adjunct, to monitor speakers, is in-ear monitoring, in which the performer hears through an earpiece. Next time you're at a concert, it's worth looking at the stage layout, to see how things have been set up so the performers can hear the right things. Bear in mind that for big venue rock concerts nowadays a lot of the ""sound equipment"" on stage is a prop. That wedge the rock singer is stepping onto might be a monitor -- or it might be an empty box for theatrical effect. That huge guitar amp might be producing sound -- or it might not be plugged in, with the real sound coming from a less visually impressive amp off-stage. Note that the term ""monitor"" is also used in the studio. It has much the same meaning -- providing what the performers and producers need to hear -- but the motivation and implementation is slightly different."
"When were the terms ""Major"" and ""Minor"" applied to keys?","I hope no one minds that I got curious, and did a bit of digging into this on my own. I discovered what appears to be an excellent resource answering this very question. The book is entitled Between Modes and Keys: German Theory, 1592-1802 by Joel Lester (1989). I do not have access to a copy of the book, but I've been able to see several relevant portions online (thank you, Google Books!). Even though it deals primarily with German music theory, it does occasionally touch on the rest of Europe. I'll try to summarize what I've gleaned so far, although I may not not be seeing the whole picture, since I'm not reading through the complete book. The primary development that necessarily preceded the concept of major and minor keys, was triadic harmony (rather than intervallic harmony). Johannes Lippius (Synopsis musicae novae, 1612) coined the term ""triad"" to describe the three-part harmonies that had emerged in the late Renaissance, and, being part-theologian, compared the concept to the Trinity. He also recognized all the inversions of intervals (and triads), including the fact that major 3rds inverted to minor 6ths (and vice versa). Any set of consonances could now be reduced to a triad, and placed in root position. He classified the 6 pairs of modes as being constructed around either a major or a minor triad, with an additional interval of a fourth either above or below. This classification didn't take hold right away; indeed, Germany seems to have been especially resistant to abandoning the old concept of modes (this seems to be a major theme of the book). Apparently, as late as Haydn, traditional German musicians were still advocating the use of modes. In fact, throughout the Baroque, there seems to have been widespread confusion, even among musicians, over the exact definition of a mode. Were modes defined by the octave range in which they sat? Were they defined by their final tone? Or by their ""reciting tone""? Or by the mood they evoked? Or by the melodic and harmonic phrases and patterns that they accommodated (especially around cadences)? Or the patterns of tones and semitones they formed? What about transpositions? And what of the chromatic alterations that were becoming popular in theatric music? Are we better off sticking to the older traditional 4 pairs of ""time-tested"" church modes? The practical solution, oftentimes, was to avoid the question altogether and just list out a handful of permissible ""keys"" (as in, on a keyboard) that could be used as the final, along with their corresponding signature (initially either blank, or containing one flat). The key of G, for example, could be used with either no signature, or a single flat. As additional keys were added to these key lists, they were classified, not by the quality of their third, but by whether they included flats, sharps, or neither in their root triads. Thus what we call ""G-minor"" would have been classed along with what we call ""B-flat major"" as a ""flat key"", while our ""C major"" and ""D minor"" would be examples of ""natural keys"", and so on. Andreas Werckmeister, a church organist and theorist, whose works (and well temperament) were well-known to Bach, had a solid understanding of modes, and describes them as being important to understand (for which he would later be dismissed by proponents of keys). But he also acknowledged that, outside of chorales, only two were in popular use in his time. In Musicae mathematicae, (1687) he gives us this description of the system then in use, along with his own proposed nomenclature (which was not adopted): Today's music is entirely different... and only some four modes are in
  use: Ionian mixed with Mixolydian, and Dorian mixed with Aeolian...
  [which each differ only in the upper fourth of their octaves].
  Thus no more than two modes can now be established. And that is not so
  unnatural... If we take Lydian, on account of the tritone... there is
  such an unnatural progression in it that even the ancients themselves
  never or hardly ever used it. Who uses Phrygian in today's music?
  Nobody. Who Mixolydian? Hardly any. Therefore... according to today's
  style of composition, we want to maintain only two modes. But because
  these can take their names neither from the Dorians, the Ionians, nor
  from any other nations (because they did not have our present style of
  music), therefore we want to name them according to their nature and
  character, so that they can be differentiated. The first can be named
  the natural mode, because it always maintains the major third in
  the beginning over the fundamental note... the second can be named the
  less natural mode, because the root numbers in its natural progression
  are further removed from perfection, and therefore do not
  establish such a happy harmony as the preceding... We can also name
  one mode perfect, and the other less perfect. Some performers
  name them dur and moll; e.g., C E G is C dur, C E-flat G
  is C moll... We are not happy with these names... nevertheless,
  because these terms are now used so commonly, they will probably
  persist. Lester claims this may be the first published usage in German of the terms dur [hard] and moll [soft] to refer to major and minor keys, but the process was already said to be widely used by performers. Also mentioned is that Werckmeister originally envisioned the minor as being derived from Dorian rather than Aeolian. Lester also shows that ""By the late seventeenth century, French works routinely differentiated keys solely on the basis of major and minor."" One reference refers to the distinction of ""major"" and ""minor"" keys as being according to the ""French opinion"". The first published recognition of all 24 major and minor keys is from a French mathematician named Jacques Ozanam, who in his Dictionaire mathematique (1691) explains: There are twice as many modes as there are notes in an octave: each of
  these notes gives its name to two modes, of which one proceeds by the
  major third and the other by the minor. Since the octave contains
  twelve notes, there are twenty-four modes. Note here that each key is called its own mode, rather than transpositions of two basic modes. An earlier French quote, from a 1689 basso continuo manual, refers to two types of modes: a ""sharp"" type that ""reduced to C,"" and a ""flat"" type that ""reduced to D,"" (here again is the Ionian/Dorian distinction). As noted by Robert Fink's answer, in Germany it is not until 1711 and 1713 that Johann Heinichen and Johann Mattheson enumerate a full list of all 24 possible major and minor keys along with their proper key signatures (using Aeolian as the relative minor). Heinichen connects them into a circle of major and minor keys, a formalization of a ""well-known"" device he learned from his organ teacher. There is also a series of letters between Mattheson and Fux, in which Fux complains that Mattheson's 24 keys are all just transpositions of two modes. Mattheson argues that each key is still distinct, due to differences in its temperament. It's interesting to note that, as late as 1722, J. S. Bach's title for the Well-Tempered Clavier refers to the 24 keys rather obliquely: ""preludes and fugues through all the tones and semitones both as regards the tertia major or Ut Re Mi, and as concerns the tertia minor or Re Mi Fa."" (Re Mi Fa could even be seen as indicating that the minor third is still rooted in the Dorian mode). In conclusion: If it could be said that there was one single thing that changed, which slowly but inevitably pushed music towards a natural distinction of major and minor keys, and made the modes obsolete, it was the recognition of triadic harmony, and the understanding that those triads could be inverted into various positions. Once that was recognized, early in the 17th century, it was only a matter of time before the concept of modal finals was replaced with that of a tonic triad, of which there could only be two types. Much of this process took place intuitively over the course of a century, with theoreticians describing the system after the fact, and traditionalists often regretting the loss of modes in the modern style of music."
How do I make piano chords sound interesting when playing along with popular songs?,"A guitarist has exactly the same problem as you do. If you just strum the chord on the downbeat, or on every beat, it sounds boring. You have to play more interesting patterns. The guitarist does have a couple of advantages over a pianist in this respect. Early on, a guitarist learns to get more rhythmic interest out of a basic chord, by varying the rhythm of strokes, and by muting. Some of these effects are more difficult on a piano, and some are impossible. The simple guitar chords a beginner learns are in a variety of inversions, so that level of interest is added ""automatically"" to a beginner's guitar playing. At the very basic end of what a guitarist might also do: Of course, from there, there are plenty of variations. Learn by copying. But you're on a piano. Fortunately, all of the above have direct equivalents on a piano keyboard: In addition, some songs are driven by their chord progression, so you can get away with block chords without it sounding boring. Some songs have few, or no, chord changes, and interest is provided by the riff. In cases like these, you're going to need to create an approximation of the riff (or develop your own riff that fits). On piano in particular, straight major and minor chords can sometimes sound a little basic, and a lot of the piano accompaniments you hear include dissonant extra notes - ninths, flat 7ths etc. It's hard to say when it's right to do this, but experiment and see what you like the sound of; and look at sheet music to see where they do it (ragtime sheet music is a good place to start). As with all music, listen to the sort of stuff you'd like to sound like, and copy what they do."
What are the practical reasons for still having transposing instruments?,"The TL;DR answer: We already have a huge body of work written for transposing instruments, and virtually all musicians playing those instruments are very familiar with reading for those instruments in their transposed keys. Changing all that requires editing every piece of music that's ever existed before being able to put it in front of people trained to read the instrument in concert pitch (or an adjusted simplified transposition), and retraining all existing musicians (or maintaining transposed and concert-pitch versions of all sheet music until all the traditionally-trained musicians retire/die off). The bass clef reads the way it does because of its position in the grand staff; ""Middle C"" (C4) is exactly one leger line above the bass clef and exactly one leger line below the treble clef. That's why middle C is so named. It makes more sense, given that explanation, to keep it that way than to try to change it. If you like, you can move the bass clef up one line, to indicate that the top line represents F, creating the subbass clef; the staff would read exactly like the treble clef then, but you'd confuse the hell out of most bass-clef readers. The longer answer: First, although there has been considerable standardization of instruments, and most orchestral instruments can now play chromatically, many instruments in the modern orchestra are variants of an instrument normally taught to beginners; most clarinetists learn to make their first squeaks on a Bb soprano clarinet, and then candidates are typically culled from that group to play the alto and bass clarinets, with a few occasionally given a piccolo clarinet. Saxophonists are typically steered first to the Eb alto sax, then branch out to the Bb soprano sax and tenor sax, or the Eb bari sax. The oboe (C) naturally leads to the cor anglais (F). The idea with these is, you play the written note with the same or very similar fingering, thus allowing you to more easily switch instruments without completely starting over. For these families of instruments, transposed keys are still very useful for their original purpose. However, that could still mean that we could have only one or two transposed keys, by picking one instrument of the family and not transposing its part (making that the ""C"" instrument), and then others would be transposed relative to that instrument (so Bb saxes would become C instruments by simply writing Bb as Bb and not C, and Eb instruments would become F instruments; almost all transposed instruments would then be either C or F). Another big reason, highly related, is that even though an instrument can play any note does not mean that it is easy to do so. Woodwinds are a big one here; they have a ""native key"" which is played primarily by simply lifting and pressing one's fingers over the open holes in the body of the instrument. Other keys, usually ones on the opposite side of the instrument's tuning and especially ones more than a few ""shifts"" away from the native key on the Circle of Fifths, become difficult to play because they start bringing in a disproportionate number of the ""banana keys"" (or ""bar keys"" or whatever they look like on the instrument in question), which are typically placed wherever it's possible to put them and for the player to get to them, which is usually not the ""logical"" place to find a key that opens that pad.  To reduce the use of these more difficult keys, alternate tunings of the instrument are available that have pretty much the same range (unlike the saxophones and the alto/bass variants of the clarinet/flute) but have parts written so that the note with the same fingering gets the same written pitch, but produces a different note thus giving the instrument a different ""native key"" that allows the player to use the instrument that is closer to its native key when playing in the concert key.  While we could still pick one instrument and call it the ""C"" instrument, for the clarinet at least, that position is already filled; there are A, Bb and C clarinets in existence (A and Bb are the ones typically seen in American ensembles but the C clarinet is still available). There are also trumpets and cornets with partials tuned to C (but, many low brass instruments are available in both Bb and C partial tunings, and yet those parts are usually in concert pitch, so one could argue that the trumpets and french horns could simply get with the program). The biggest reason is that music is like history; it is the sum total of everything that has come before. So, if we were, at some point, to say ""OK, from now on, we'll teach all new entering middle school band students in concert pitch and do away with all this transposing"", we'd have to go back and transpose every piece of music that has ever been written for those instruments. Then, all the existing master instrumentalists would have to re-learn how to sightread for their instrument (something I don't think they'd be keen on, meaning for the next 50 years or so you'd have to keep and differentiate between ""concert key"" and ""transposed key"" versions of the part for each transposing instrument and each piece). It would be a painful transition, and we in the U.S. don't tend to like changing basic learned patterns, even if it would ultimately make our lives easier (one of the reasons the U.S. still hasn't fully switched to metric, and most of us still type on QWERTY keyboards, which are difficult to use by design)?"
How can I improve my piano sight reading?,"The first thing you need to do is: Stop writing the letter names!!! This applies to piano or any other instrument. If you keep doing this when you practice, you won't be practicing your sight reading, only your technique. In other words, this is training you to play an A when you read the letter ""A"", instead of the musical notation for it. If you can identify the notes, and it just takes you longer than you would like or than what is practical, try exercises in which you read notes out loud as fast as you can (not singing, so it doesn't have to be in tune, as that's a whole different animal). The point here is to train yourself to stop hesitating on identifying the note you see in the printed music, or to do so as little as possible.  Remember that to be able to do this, your eyes need to be reading at least a little bit further than the note you are playing/singing.  I know it is hard, because I was there too, but the sooner you stop writing the note names and force yourself to identify it on the spot, the sooner your fingers will start getting used to reaching somewhere in specific as soon as you read a note. It might be a slow process at the start, but if you hang in there, it will be worth it!"
WHY do harmonics happen?,"It's a simple question with quite an involved answer.  First a quick primer on wavelength, frequency and pitch.  Frequency is how many times a vibration repeats in a period of time. Wavelength is the length of a single vibration, which for something like a guitar string, corresponds to the length of time it takes to repeat. You can see that if the wavelength halves, the frequency doubles. Conveniently, the wavelength of the sound from a vibrating string is proportional to the length of the string, so we can talk about the two almost interchangeably. Doubling the frequency (halving the wavelength) takes us up an octave. When you hit/pluck/shake anything, it will vibrate at all kinds of frequency. Most of those frequencies will die away very quickly. Here's why.   These are conceptual pictures of a string vibrating. Think of one end as the nut of a guitar, and the other as the bridge. The bottom one is ""not a resonant frequency"", because the line doesn't end at the bridge. I could perhaps have drawn the last part of the wave with a steeper curve, so it reached the dot, and that would have shown what happens to waves of that frequency -- rather than work with the length of the string to reinforce itself, it works against the length of the string, gets cancelled out, and dies away. Now look at the other waves. They sustain because they ""fit"" into the length of the string. They would carry on vibrating that way forever, if it weren't for the sound board, the friction of the air, and so forth, perhaps the magnetic field of a pickup, taking energy away. I've shown the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th -- but they keep going on, at various levels of loudness.  The complex waveform of a guitar note is the result of adding all those resonant frequencies together. Here are some waveforms:
  Here is a frequency analysis of single guitar note - horizontal axis is frequency, vertical axis is amplitude. Each spike is a different harmonic.
 It's the precise mixture of frequencies, and how quickly each one dies away, that provides the timbre of the instrument. A good way to get a feel for this is to play with an analogue synth (or a simulation of one). These use ""additive synthesis"", in which an oscillator produces a pure sin wave, and you build up a timbre by adding in ""harmonics"" using more oscillators, choosing the relative pitch and volume for each one. You may have noticed that your guitar sounds ""boomier"" if you pluck it near the 12th fret, and more trebly when you pluck it near the bridge. That's because when you pluck near the middle of the string, you're giving lots of energy to the 1st harmonic, and very little to the other harmonics. Now, what happens if you gently touch the midpoint of the string? The result is that you subtract the fundamental note, and a lot of ""odd"" harmonics, leaving a harmonic that's an octave up, and some of the higher harmonics. The result is a sound with fewer harmonics that therefore sounds ""purer"". A great way to get a feel for this is to play the open string, then listen carefully as you gently touch the midpoint, to see how you achieve the octave by subtracting part of the sound."
Why learn scales? What are they for?,"Scales are important for a guitarist, just as learning good grammar is important to speaking properly. If you are intent on ""playing"" guitar then learning the language of music is going to be inevitable. From my own personal and teaching standpoint, guitar music should start with Chords.  As opposed to notes.  To me they are the most practical form of music as they are immediate.  Consider chords to be words.   So like a child, you are taught ""MUM"", ""DAD"", ""YES"", ""NO"" - so you might learn the chords G, C and D.  That may suffice you if all the conversations you will ever want to do on guitar is in the Key of G, eg.   But soon you will want to know other things, like Em, Am and now the intensity and complexity of MORE KNOWLEDGE comes into play. Well that's where SCALES comes in.  They are the alphabet of the chords that you play.  It can make a difference from a chord progression / accompaniement sounding like ""GOOD MORNING"" to ""GOOD MORNING, HOW ARE YOU? I FEEL FINE!, ISN'T IT A GREAT DAY TODAY?"" Scales can set the tone.  Knowledge of this alphabet allows you to add twiddles and trinkets to your rhythm work... that is, adding little fills based on your knowledge of scale shapes or forms or even better - true music theory where you know whether a particular note is a flat 3rd or diminished 5th and whether it is a Lydian or a Phrygian mode of a scale.   All this KNOWLEDGE of SCALES allows you to set the mood and tone of your playing. Now the connotation of scales is another thing entirely.  In my mind, metal and hard rock styles have tinged the learning of scales slightly as SCALES often gets equated to SHRED.  But that's not the case.  Even styles like Blues and Jazz and Latin all have their tones and styles completely defined by the SCALES that are dominant in their music structure. Last week, for example, I was explaining to one of my students the elusive difference of the MAJOR and MINOR scale change of a Blues progression.  This was invaluable information to him - because it now explains what he can hear in records/songs.  He knew there was something going on but he didn't have the vocabulary to explain it - which translates into better technique and conscious choice in what notes to play.  SCALES will lead to understanding; the ability to know and recall relationships between notes; this leads towards understanding the relationship between chords and how this sets an emotional mood; this leads towards understanding good composition and song writing; this leads towards good technique and more interesting rhythm work; this leads towards a roadmap for soloing and knowing various melodies to play over the right chords at the right time; this leads to complete mastery of the guitar. LEARNING SCALES can do this for you.  It's invaluable and will open up the guitar for you."
What does it mean to write a song in a certain key?,"To understand the answer to this question you need and understanding of these concepts: A song is regarded as being in the key of C major if the pitch C is its key center, if the notes in the song chiefly fall in the C-major scale (as opposed to the C-minor scale, or one of the other scale-modes based on C), and the chord triad of C major serves the function of the tonic chord throughout the chord progressions in the song. There are exceptions to everything. A song would generally be regarded as being in the key of C major if it started out in C major, even if it ended in another key. Some songs stay in the same key all the way through, and some songs change keys. Or it could start in C major but incorporate chords borrowed from other keys, use melody notes outside of the notes in the C major scale, or it could leave the key of C major entirely at one point, only to return to C major before it ends.

List of average genre tempo (BPM) levels?,Let's start a list! Hip Hop is around 80-115 BPM Triphop / Downtempo around 90-110 BPM Concert marches are typically ~120 BPM. House varies between 118 and 135 BPM Techno 120-160 BPM Dubstep is around 140 BPM 70's to 100 (mostly 80-90) Screamers are usually 130-150 BPM Hardstyle is around 150 BPM Juke/Footwork is around 160 BPM Drum and Bass averages a BPM of 160-180 Grime 140 BPM Some of the basic tempo markings See the discussion on the terms Lento and Agitato as they relate to tempo.
Is there any practical difference between 3/4 and 3/8 time?,"These two time signatures both indicate simple triple time (also known as waltz time). They are mainly used in the same genres:   All of these genres commonly use simple triple time i.e they have three beat per measure (usually with the first beat being the strongest). The obvious differences between 3/4 and 3/8 are the number and length of the beats (there is one other simple triple meter, 3/2). 3/8 has three quavers and 3/4 has three crotchets. However, 3/8 time usually suggests a higher tempo or a shorter hypermeter than 3/4. This is not always the case as there is no strict rule, but it is often implied."
How to transcribe music by ear?,"For transcribing music, one does not need ""perfect"" pitch, just ""good enough"" pitch. And practice. If you can identify chords or harmony progression, a very common set of chords will be I, IV and V (so for the key of C major, those would be C, F & G). One thing you'll need to memorize is the circle of fifths (and how to fill out, or derive, a scale from the name).  Because a lot of western music uses I, IV & V chords, you should/will learn to recognize them.  Sample songs with typical chord progressions:
I, IV, IV (then back to I) - La Bamba (Richie Valens)
I, IV - You Can't Always Get (Rolling Stones)
IV, V, I - Mr Tamborine Man (Bob Dylan).   So when you're listening to something and you hear a lot of E♭, F and B♭ chords, then it is extremely likely that you're listening to something in B♭ major. "
Does the difference in harmonic series between instruments have a significant effect on the consonance of the sound?,"Is it an important thing to consider in Orchestration? You have in fact stumbled onto the very foundation (and art) of orchestration. Orchestration is about not only knowing how each instrument sounds, but how to blend those sounds together to get the effects / textures you're looking for. Composers generally don't think about blend in terms of harmonic series, but as Tim alluded to, we think about character. To illustrate my point, I'll give a couple brief examples. To extend your (the OP's) point, not only does each instrument have a unique base timbre, but that timbre also changes not only throughout the instrument's pitch range but dynamic as well. Let's, for a moment, think like an orchestrator: EXAMPLE 1 All of this is wonderful to know, but it's also important to know that clarinets also get buried easily. If we wanted the sound to cut through the ensemble, you could pair the clarinet with oboe, trumpet, or piccolo, for example. If you wanted a softer, fuzzier sound, you would blend the clarinet with flute, especially in the flute's lowest register. Every instrument has unique characteristics dynamically (in terms of the dynamic range they are able to produce, which in fact does change throughout the instrument's range; such as the oboe at the bottom of its range!), timbrally, and unique characteristics due to the nature of how the instrument makes sound (for example, woodwinds have a more difficult time playing fast, repeated notes, where brass and strings would not). Composers and orchestrators have go-to combinations that are tried and true and deliver confident results (ever wonder why ""movie"" music sounds a certain way different than other types of orchestral music?) There are too many to list here, but there are many, many books written on the subject. Thoughtful question and I hope my answer is helpful."
Why do octaves sound equivalent?,"There are indications of an underlying neurological (and arguably evolutionary) basis for perceiving octaves as equivalent, see for example this discussion.  This phenomenon is pretty fundamental in that it is also seen in monkeys and other mammals, but not (apparently) in some songbirds.  There has been quite a bit of work on the neurological basis for octave equivalence, however I'm not aware of corresponding work that assesses the neurological basis involved in the perception of other intervals."
"What instruments are inexpensive, portable and not too loud?","An attempt to synthesise the various answers given, while giving some opinions of my own. Portability 'Portable' is a bit of a vague requirement. Some instruments fit in your pocket. Some instruments fit in a small backpack. Some instruments fit in a large backpack. Loudness I'm not sure what's too loud for a dorm room. It depends on your neighbour's patience. It depends how good you are (much more pleasant to hear someone good practising). It depends on how much you play and at what time of day/night. The problem with inherently quiet instruments is that one day you may want to play to an audience, and having some volume would be desirable. But you can't have everything. So with those things in mind: Electronic instruments Can be played with headphones, or an amp turned low. Small keyboards are available. You'd probably find them limiting fairly quickly. MIDI flutes, guitars etc. exist but the affordable ones are essentially toys. Electric instruments Can also be played with headphones, or an amp turned low. Electric guitar is the obvious candidate. You can get travel guitars, but they're still in the large-backpack category. Acoustic string instruments A uke is a pretty good candidate. It's not pocket size, but it fits in a small bag. Cheap ukes are cheap. It's worth spending a touch more to get one with reliable intonation. If you get good, you can graduate to some really quite lovely instruments. I'm mostly a guitar player, but I've been known to take a uke on business trips, so I have something to practise on in the hotel room. The downside of most string instruments is that they're not all that robust. I wouldn't like to put a backpack containing a uke into a coach baggage trunk, or airport baggage handling. Skills you learn on a uke are somewhat transferable to guitar. There are other string instruments. Travel guitars. Violins. Violins can get pretty loud, and sound awful when you're starting out. More obscure: autoharp, strum stick, cigar box guitar Wind instruments I'm not going to mention any brass instruments, because they're loud. The smallest of the woodwind instruments are very small and pretty robust compared to string instruments. At the cheapest end, there's tin whistles and recorders. For the sake of your neighbours, try and find an instrument with good intonation. Cheap recorders can sound dreadful. Flute, oboe, clarinet - getting progressively louder. Some wind instruments come apart. Even a tenor recorder is pretty portable, since it separates into three robust pieces. The lower the pitch of the instrument, the quieter it tends to be, since all the energy comes from your breath, and you have to move more air to make deeper notes. Smaller instruments might technically be quiet, but they can be shrill and the sound can carry. Er, ocarinas are small and quiet, and surprisingly capable. Melodica was mentioned, and seems fun. Bellows instruments Melodeons and accordions are designed to be loud. However concertinas are quiet and in the small-backback category. Reed instruments A category just for the harmonica. It fits in your pocket. Your first one will be cheap. You will be welcomed by blues/rock guitarists. It's not quiet though. If you get into it, you'll probably end up buying more of them, in various keys. Exotica Thumb piano, musical saw, etc. These are fun, but perhaps odd choices as a primary instrument."
What are some useful and effective exercises for training absolute pitch?,"Perfect Pitch has some different Definitions:
There are different levels of perfect pitch and absolute pitch. They are all about being able to either identify or generate (i.e. sing) notes without a recent reference. People's ability range from being able to guess right some of the time, to instantly telling you which note is not being played when someone bangs 11 out of 12 notes as a cluster on the piano. I emphasized ""recent"" reference, because in many ways what most people call perfect pitch in a way is just relative pitch, except you are using relative pitches that you haven't heard even that day. Generating Notes without Reference:
I'm going to focus on the ability to be able to sing a note when you first wake up. This is often a good starting point for people that ""don't have perfect pitch"". The reason is, and here is the kicker, many people do and they just don't know it. The way you can discover this is by first thing in the morning, try think of a piece you were playing the day before. Think of what key that was in, sing the not of that key, and see if you are right. Yes, you are just guessing, but what many musicians who practice a lot discover is that they guess right quite often (not always, but more often than not). If you look at my ""ability to hear music before it is played"" section in this answer, I talk about learning to sight sing by only playing the note of the key as a starting reference. If you ""guess"" by using your memory of a various pieces in different keys you know before you play the note, you might find you tend to guess right there as well. From this, over time, many people start to develop some sense of what many people call ""perfect pitch"". I think it is part learning to trust your instinct, and part developing the ability. Like many things in learning music, this process will probably take years.  I think the most important thing about trying to learn this ability is to have fun ""guessing"", and if it just never happens for you it is not really a big deal, many great musicians don't really have this ability."
What is the origin of the up bow and down bow symbols for bowed string instruments?,"Last year I was told by a Baroque and Renaissance expert cellist/gambist that the ∏ and ⋁ signs originate from abbreviations of the latin nobilis and vilis. This blog post also says something along those lines. Apparently, french composers liked to write n above important notes, demanding that they be played in a particularly beautiful, noble fashion. To the players, this was generally a prompt to play those notes from the frog for best control. v was the opposite, indicating that these notes didn't need to be payed to much attention to, which was then generally used as an opportunity to bring back the bow. The composers probably didn't really care about that, only about the tone, hence didn't directly write p and t which would have literally expressed pull or push. But instead of elaborating on these tonal qualities, I suspect many teachers just taught the simple rule “n means down-, v upstroke”, so the original meaning got lost and the n symbol became a symbol most today wouldn't recognise as such."
"As a guitarist, how can I learn to sight-read music?","Yes, unfortunately it's all about practice. But there are some things you can focus on to speed up the process:
- Learn the notes on the neck by heart, and the associated intervals. That is, learn the notes on the low E-string and the relation between those notes and the notes on the higher strings so that you without thinking can fret a certain interval. When this works, continue with the other strings.
- Play scales and say the names of the notes out loud as you play them. This will improve your familiarity with the placement of the notes on the neck.
These two exercises help you into thinking in tems of notes rather that fretboard positions. Why I focus on the guitar neck rather than the sheet reading itself is because playing to sheet music is a twosided thing: Understanding the score as it is written and mapping that onto the guitar. As you are saying you are picturing a piano keyboard for the mapping, but you need to start mapping onto the guitar, and preferrably not do any mental calculations for the mapping at all as the notes position on the neck becomes intuitive. That leaves only the reading of the music and that just takes determination and practice. Good luck!"
Does an accidental apply to all octaves?,"Wikipedia has it right. An accidental that is written in, as shown in the example above, only applies to the note in that octave until the end of the measure. You may be confusing it with the sharps and flats in the key signature which do apply to every octave. It's also possible that in the pieces you are playing you are seeing a courtesy accidental instead of an actual accidental. Courtesy accidental are unnecessary, but are typically deemed helpful for the reader."
Why do I yawn while singing?,"One cause of yawning can certainly be that your body needs more oxygen, so key to solving the problem is getting enough breaths in. Some scores have breaths marked, but  for others you'll need to work out for yourself where you can fit your breaths in. You can train for bigger breaths but some people find it difficult to breathe properly.
I know a couple of people who were asthmatic and had this problem, and they found swimming helped them learn to breathe more deeply and take deeper, more controlled breaths."
"Is there any ""research"" in music theory?","My PhD is in Music Composition, but it was a heavily theory-focused program. I also have many theorist colleagues. Your question is interesting, and difficult to answer in total detail without writing a book, so I won't try to be exhaustive. Let me first say that the understanding of ""Music Theory"" is most definitely not complete, and that there absolutely is continuing research.  A lot of people use the phrase ""Music Theory"" as synonymous with ""Theory of Common-Practice Tonal music of the 17th–19th Centuries in Europe,"" but it the actual field is vastly larger than that. There are so many different genres and types of music throughout all human eras and virtually everywhere on the globe. Even a study of just the music happening throughout the world right now on September 10th would be a massive study requiring a huge number of sub-disciplines of theory, composition, musicology, history, ethnomusicology etc. Historical research involving fragments of music notation from Ancient Greece and from Assyria and Babylon is ongoing and complex. Academic study of the musical structures and cultural impacts of pop, rock, hip-hop and other recorded forms of music is a fairly new and exciting field (for example, although my primary compositional world is centered on various kinds of ""atonal"" chamber music, my dissertation was a close analytical reading of several albums by a band called Nine Inch Nails). Ethnomusicological studies of Brazilian music and Hindustani music are being taught at my school, and new insights are being made constantly. But even if we restrict ourselves to notated music more-or-less within the lineage of European ""classical"" music, theory is far from complete. Composers at the turn of the 20th-century in Europe and America began exploring new harmonic and melodic pitch combinations that are almost totally different than those favored during the common-practice era. They weren't just throwing random notes together, however (until later composers like John Cage occasionally experimented with that too!), they were developing new ideas about how to construct music with its own internal logic. For many composers of a theoretical bent, such as Arnold Schoenberg, this lead to definitions of entirely new theoretical systems. They were primarily interested in composing, but this was simultaneously ""research"" in new music-theoretical areas. For example, a new theoretical system called ""set theory"" developed as a way to, among other things, classify and catalog every possible combination of pitches in the 12-TET system. And although that set-theoretical cataloging process is complete, research into the effects of different set combinations, and the musical impact of different set choices, and the ways that one set can be transformed into another set (a sub-branch called Transformation theory) are very much open areas. In fact, I'm almost certain that research along these lines and others is a fundamentally open field that will never be truly exhausted. But even if we restrict ourselves to only common-practice music of the 18th-century and Europe, there is plenty of ongoing research both historical and theoretical. I think it's fair to say that the underlying basics of common-practice music theory are essentially set and complete by now. The genome has been sequenced, if you will. But research into the specifics of how a particular composer realized those theoretical defaults in particular pieces is essentially inexhaustible. Just because the majority of, say, Beethoven's music has been analyzed, doesn't mean that people aren't finding new ways of looking at his musical choices or previously unexplored measures every year.  I'll try a mathematical analogy. In a sense, the field of polynomial algebra is complete once we've expanded the concept of ""number"" to include the complex numbers. We can say precisely how many solutions any given polynomial equation will have and confidently state that all of those solutions exist within the complex numbers. However, actually finding the solutions to, for example, a 12th-order polynomial is an entirely different matter. And even if we discover a full-proof, finite method for solving all polynomials of every possible degree, that still doesn't mean anything about whether further research in numbers beyond the complex numbers such as Quaternions and Octonions is worthwhile. And even if it did, that still wouldn't mean there wasn't more research to be done in calculus, or field theory, or statistics, or any other field of mathematics. Research in a field as vast as Music Theory will never be complete, because we can always discover or create new vistas to explore."
Why is the double bass the only instrument in the violin family tuned in fourths?,"It is because the double bass, essentially, comes from a different family of instruments than the cello, viola and violin. This is a controversial assertion among music historians, as these things evolved continously, but many scholars do not consider the double-bass to be a part of the violin family at all. The argument goes like this: About two centuries before the violin, viola and cello were invented, there was the viola da gamba family: the violone (the double-bass viol), the viola da gamba, the tenor viol, and the treble viol. These instruments came into prominence in the late 1400s, after originating in Spain. These were instruments of six strings, tuned in fourths, like the modern guitar. (and they had frets, too.)  Instruments of the viol or viola da gamba family, from the violone on the left to the treble viol on the right. The violin, viola and cello were newer inventions that came along almost 200 years after the first appearance of the viola da gamba family. The violin family of instruments came from Italy, and as they were originally conceived, there was no bass instrument in that family. The lowest-pitched instrument of the violin family was the cello.  Violin-family instruments have four strings tuned in fifths. They also have structural differences which give them a much stronger, louder sound than the relatively quiet viola da gamba family instruments. Once the newly-designed violin, viola and cello came on the scene, the viola da gamba family fell out of usage, because they could not compete with the loud, cutting sound of the violin, viola and cello. Since there was not originally a bass member of the violin, viola and cello family, luthiers adapted the existing design of the violone (the bass viol, six strings tuned in fourths) to make it better able to accompany the new violin-family instruments. Along the way the violone became longer in scale length, to increase string tension, tone and projection, and it lost its two highest strings. It also lost its frets. This became the modern double-bass. The structure and design of the modern double-bass still has more in common with the earlier viola da gamba than with the cello -- even if, superficially, they look similar. The Wikipedia article on the history of the cello explains the relationship of the older, lower-pitched Spanish violone (tuned in fourths) to the younger Italian cello (tuned in fifths)."
Can a flute soloist sit?,"Absolutely.  Nobody ever expects (extreme case) Itzhak Perlman to stand. Personally, I'd be a happy audience if a flautist sat on a barstool, as many guitarists tend to do.
Now, performing while on a unicycle..."
Why does conventional playing style give the string manipulation to the left hand?,"Your logic fits and, as some of the commentators have stated, I've pondered about this in the past. Usually your dominant hand naturally can handle doing a lot more work, like you've stated.  In playing instruments, the dominant hand also should be used for doing the ""big jobs"": This also goes for the guitar.  If you're playing rhythm, the dominant hand is doing all of this work, upstrokes, downstrokes, arpeggios, string skipping, etc., whereas the other hand is simply fretting a chord.   Picking/strumming can require big/quick/exact movements.  Fingering and fretting gennerally requires smaller, more dexterous movements. I guess the misconception/myth is that picking/strumming is less work than fretting.  I wouldn't say that one is more than the other, it's just different types of work, and generally, the dominant hand is better suited for picking/strumming. Note: There are some people who are dominant right-handed and play left-handed, and vice versa.  In the end, it all comes down to whatever is the most comfortable for you.  Nowadays, there is no lack of left-handed guitars available, so if you find it easier and more comfortable to play that way, go for it! Also, see this page which has some more information in deciding whether to play one way vs. another."
Major scale of one note is the Minor scale of another note?,"You’ve discovered a very deep fact about music that is referred to as “mode.” It isn’t ridiculous at all to say that the same notes can have a different emotional quality depending on how you use them, in fact that’s a huge part of what composition is about! Most western composers use the same twelve notes to express everything from rage to joy to anhedonia. The seven classic modes are all defined as a specific sequence of whole and half steps: some version of WWHWWWH. What I mean by “version” is that any starting point in that sequence can be used if we just rotate the sequence. For instance, I might start with the first half step: that gives me HWWWH, and then I finish up with the part of the sequence i skipped from the beginning, WW. The complete sequence is HWWWHWW. If I start my scale with an E, that gives me EFGABCDE, and this mode is called E Phrygian. You’ll notice this is the same notes as C Major—CDEFGABC—only rotated so that it starts on E.  But what a difference it makes! C is the home note of C Major, and it can be approached by a half step up from the B below it. E is the home note of E Phrygian, but it can’t be approached from below by a half step. However, it can be approached from above by a half step. The most common resolutions in C major involve an upward push, but in E Phrygian they involve a downward fall; that’s bound to have an emotional effect. There’s a reason that Phrygian scales are very common in heavy metal music, but C major is quite rare.  If I rotate the step sequence in a different way, I get WHWWHWW. If I start on A, that gives me ABCDEFGA. You referred to this as A minor, but actually it would be better to call it A natural minor, or, better yet, A Aeolian. That’s the name of this mode. It doesn’t have a half step on either side of the home note, and thus has yet another set of potential emotional qualities. However, the world of true A minor is more complicated: sometimes the sixth and seventh notes of the scale are raised by one half step from their “natural” state and at other times are left natural. You should look up harmonic minor and melodic minor scales for more details on this. The upshot is that A minor is more complicated than A Aeolian, since it sometimes use F# and G#.  One last example of how order can matter: the sentences “I’m a genius, am I not?” and “I’m not a genius, am I?” Same collection of words, different meaning. "
How to start playing by ear/improvising?,"I started by learning to recognize intervals with some ear-training software. This sort of practice is quite frustrating at first and you'll make lots of mistakes. The error rate goes down quite gradually, but you do get better over time. It's best to do it a few minutes a day, and don't ramp up the difficulty too quickly. Singing or humming each interval before trying to recognize it really helps, so I recommend it even if you're not all that interested in being a good singer. After some of that, you should be able to figure out the intervals for simple tunes like ""Jingle Bells"" that you already know how to sing. (Again, expect to make lots of mistakes and improve slowly. In a song, you will want to figure out where each note is compared to the tonic.) The next step is to learn melodies that you don't know well from recordings of music you're interested in. It's useful to have software that lets you repeat a few bars of the song so you can work on it until you get it. Again, you want to learn to sing or hum each section before playing it, because your voice is an essential part of recognizing it. I'm still learning this and that's as far as I got. There are some other good answers in the ""Related"" list on the side. For example:
What are the most effective ear training methods?"
Why doesn't my synthesized note sound natural?,"I haven't been able to listen to the files, but I think Pat's comment is very likely to be closest to the mark. From the spectrographs, it looks like you may be missing two things: Some suggestions: Edit after hearing the file: The sound of a piano note changes over time. Your synthesized sample is only 1 second long. You should be comparing the sound for the entire life of the note. Once you have a decent sound, one thing you might do is double it, since most of the range of the piano has two or three strings per note instead of one. Once it's doubled, slightly detune one (or two) of them. And I mean slightly. Good piano tuners get them very close but they still might differ by .5 Hz or so. Note that a beat frequency of .5 Hz takes 2 seconds to complete a cycle, so that's another reason why a 1 second sample is not enough listening time. Overall I think your synthesized sample is pretty good. It is missing some of those components mentioned above, and you should also start comparing lower and higher notes to see how your algorithm holds up."
Why do notes have multiple names?,"The reason there are multiple names for notes is that the same note may function differently in different contexts. If you just play a single note with no context, then it could have a multitude of different names. For example if you played the note in between F and G you could call it F# or Gb or more obscurely E## or Abbb. They are all valid names and are referred to as enharmonic equivalents, but if you gave more context like you were playing the G major scale or playing a Db minor chord certain note names would make more sense.  Typically notes are named based on the scale, chord or interval they are in. For this, we'll just look at examples in 12 tone Equal Temperament, where are 12 unique notes that repeat every octave. A majority of scales in music contain 7 notes. Each scale degree gets a letter from A to G based on the root of the scale and type of scale. The naming convention for the 12 notes makes the C major scale have no accidentals in it. Using the scale pattern for major the C Major scale has the notes C,D,E,F,G,A,B,C and can be seen below.  The C major scale has only naturally named notes and the pattern is nice and simple. No accidentals and you see one of each letter name. If we were to start the major scale on D, we would have the notes D,E,F#,G,A,B,C#,D as shown below.  Like C major you see one of each letter name, but now there are two accidentals F# and C#. Because of the major scale pattern these notes are named this way. Their enharmonic equivalent Gb and Db would not make sense in this context as if they were used we would have the notes D,E,Gb,G,A,B,Db,D as shown below.  If the D major scale's notes were named this way there would never be an F or C and key signatures would be useless. Intervals are named based on how far the letters are apart from each other and then by how far the notes are from each other. Because of this the name of the notes affect what the interval is. One example is the notes C to Eb make a minor 3rd which is a common interval seen below.   The notes are C and Eb are a 3rd apart and it can be seen from the skip from one line to another. The enharmonic equivalent of Eb (which is D#) is not a third away thus the interval of C to D# is an Augmented 2nd instead of a minor third.   They sound the same, but they function differently. These intervals are the building blocks of many chords and whether a note is a 3rd or 2nd away makes a difference.   Chords are a collection of 2 or more notes (usually at least 3) and typically they are built in 3rds. The intervals between each of the root note and the other notes is how the chord is named. For example a C minor chord has the notes C, Eb, and G in it. From the C to the Eb is a minor 3rd and the C to the  G is a perfect 5th.  Because chords are defined by their intervals, typically there is only one enharmonic equivalent that is appropriate to spell the chord. If D# was used instead of Eb the chord would look like the this.   It is not easy to see that the D# is acting as the 3rd of the C minor chord because it looks like a second. If there are double flats or sharps in a score most likely it is to show what a certain note is functioning as in a chord. For example a C fully diminished chord is spelled C, Eb, Gb, Bbb and consists of a root, minor 3rd, diminished 5th, and diminished 7th.   Typically someone will write the enharmonic equivalent of Bbb (A) to avoid someone reading double flats.  The above is show within the context of Equal Temperament, but the idea is the same if not more important in other temperaments. The only difference is that in other temperaments is not all the harmonic equivalents used above are the same frequency so the distinction is much more important as writing for example an A♯ vs a B♭ will sound different."
How to interpret half notes combined with thirty-second stems?,"This type of notation is used to indicate tremolos. A single figure is made up of two noteheads of identical value (in this case, half notes) that are beamed together in a way that indicates the speed of the tremolo. The rhythmic length to be played is that of one of the beamed half notes. You would alternate between the two noteheads at a speed of 32nd notes for the duration of two beats. In this 6th bar you see a variation of this, where the triple beaming stays constant to indicate 32nd note tremolos, but the rhythmic duration changes from two beats (half notes) to one beat (quarter notes) to three quarters of a beat (dotted 8th notes)."
How to minimize the pain for a beginning guitar student so they won’t give up before they develop calluses?,"Learning the guitar as a beginner has many inherent challenges from the very start. For one, you are asking the new guitar student to teach their brain how to tell their fingers to contort in very strange and unnatural ways that they have never before even remotely contemplated.  And the finger strength needed for many chords has not been developed yet.  On top of that you add the rather significant pain factor associated with pressing metal strings against metal frets with tender finger tips.  And we haven’t even thought about the dreaded F barre chord yet. Because of these challenges, it’s easy to understand why so many beginning guitarist, give up before they can play their first chord progression. I would like to share a method that has kept many aspiring future guitarist from giving up on learning guitar.  I think it will be valuable for anyone who is about to begin their journey, or who may have tried to learn guitar in the past, but were not willing to endure the pain. The following advice assumes that the student will be learning on a steel string acoustic guitar. First thing we need to do is create our own custom FINGER FRIENDLY set of strings for our acoustic steel string guitar.  To do that we will need two sets of strings. First set is a ""Silk and Steel"" set - such as the Martin M130 or M1400 standard gauge strings.  The wound strings have a thin layer of nylon fiber that acts as a padding or cushion around the steel core – making these strings much more forgiving to play.  Also, because they have less metal per string (nylon as part of the core) they tune to pitch with less tension making them easier to fret with less pressure.   
Silk and Steel guitar string But we will need a second set - because even though the wound stings are padded, the unwound plain steel strings are just as brutal on tender fingers as the guitar’s original strings. So to get the other two strings for our custom set we need the least expensive electric guitar strings in the lightest possible gauge (ultra light or super light) which will have a high e string of .008 inch diameter and a b string of .011 inch diameter.  These two plain steel unwound strings are very thin compared to the .0115 and .014 inch diameter of the silk and steel string set. You need electric strings to get the two steel strings, because acoustic strings don’t come in those ultra light gauges.  The two unwound (plain steel) strings we need, are made of the same material on either acoustic or electric sets.  What’s different about electric strings is the wound strings are wound in nickel so the magnetic pickups will work better with them.  You do NOT want to put the wound strings from an electric set on an acoustic guitar – because the tone will not be as pleasing as wound strings made for acoustic.  So unless you also have an electric guitar, give the other four strings from the electric set to someone you know who owns an electric guitar – or recycle them. Remove the existing strings from your acoustic guitar and replace them with the four wound strings from the silk and steel set and the two very thin plain steel strings from the electric guitar set.  This gives you a custom set of steel strings that will tune up with less tension and be way more comfortable and less painful to play.  On some guitars, the very thin electric plain strings may be a little too close to the frets to avoid some buzzing (because the nut slots will be bigger than the string), but don't worry about that right now - we are just learning - and a little string buzz won't be so noticeable when a beginning student is struggling just to make a note.  This custom set is for temporary use, to permit less painful practice during the beginning stages of learning to play notes and form chords.  They will still have enough metal (unlike nylon strings) and require enough tension to slowly build calluses, while minimizing the pain to a tolerable level.  It’s like training for a marathon and starting out running a mile per day and gradually working your way up as you build stamina and endurance.  They won’t sound as good as a regular set of strings, but trust me, a student just learning to play is happy to get any semblance of a note to ring out as they press down on those strings.  So until the student is ready to perform in front of an audience, the way the strings SOUND is far less important than their ability to press them down hard enough just to make a note (other than the sound of plucking a muted string). Soon the student will starts to build some callouses, and gain some success forming some chords and changing chords and begin to gain a sense of satisfaction with their progress and a feeling that they actually CAN learn to make music with a guitar.  And - since practice is now far less painful, they are likely to progress much faster than they otherwise would – because they will spend more time practicing. Before long the student will be ready to switch to a regular set of light acoustic strings.  Along with the advice of installing the custom set of easy to play strings, it is important to encourage moderation in practice in the beginning.  Start with short 15 minute practice periods spaced out during the day, so that the skin on the fingers (and muscles) will have time to recover from the stress before any damage is done.  Gradually increase these practice sessions a few minutes every few days until you can comfortably practice 30 minutes at a time. Here is another  thought.  If a new guitar is to be purchased, a shorter scale acoustic guitar such as a Taylor GS Mini (Around $499 US new and $300 used) will be easier to play because the shorter strings will require less tension to tune. Learning to play guitar is not easy.  So taking as much pain out of the process is an important compromise to make in the beginning, to increase the likelihood of success in the long run.  I sincerely hope this will help many beginning guitar students get past the painful beginning to become lifelong guitar playing enthusiast. Best of luck - and don't give up! You can do it!"
What do 'vent holes' do on a music stand?,"They save weight. They don't save a large percentage of the overall weight of the stand, but they make it less top-heavy and therefore more stable when raised high or angled back a long way. Just to expand on the question of ""why not just make it thinner?"" - the reason for that is because a thicker sheet with holes will be stiffer than a thinner sheet with no holes with the same amount of metal in. It won't necessarily be stronger in every loading mode - indeed it may be weaker in some - but with a structure like a music stand, wobbliness becomes a problem long before breakage does."
What do you do when a string breaks or you drop your pick on stage?,"I recall seeing a show years ago. fIREHOSE was doing a ""50 states in 50 days"" tour, and this show was a triple bill with Madder Rose opening. Madder Rose's bassist popped his E string, and he just knocked the bassline up an octave, which really kicked the song into fifth gear. He then spent minutes trying to beg, borrow or steal a bass or bass string, which just knocked all the momentum out of the show. Later, Mike Watt popped his G string. (I still have it.) He nodded to George Hurley, who started in on a drum solo. Maybe a drum solo isn't the most punk-rock thing ever, but it filled the space while Mike changed a string and tuned up. At the end of it, there's Mike Watt, Greg Norton (ex-Husker Du bassist) and me, watching George get his thing on, with Mike looking at me and nodding toward George, as if to say, ""That's my drummer. Isn't he good?"" And he was. The point of it is, it happens. It happens to starting out opening bands and it happens to top-of-bill bands. Things fall apart. It's scientific. But there are a few takeaway points. 1) Be able to do without - The first bassist really took the song to the next level just by knocking the bass up an octave. Word is that Jeff Beck dropped a pick, started playing with fingers and decided to always go that way. There might be things you can't do by picking with fingernails, but maybe what you can do will work out for a while. 2) Have spares - the SEALs say ""Two is one. One is none."" Have spare strings. Have spare picks. Have spare cables. If you need it, have two in case one breaks. If you play a Floyd Rose, getting the balance back will take longer than a song, so bring a second guitar. That being said, it's a good idea to have several spare windings on the tuner of Floyd Rose guitars, so if the break is near the bridge, you can unlock the bridge and the nut, run some more string, and get it back together fairly quickly. 3) Have a plan - In my story, Mike Watt went to the drum solo when he had to change strings. On the Dead Kennedys' Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death, there's a live track called ""Night of the Living Rednecks"" where, after East Bay Ray had a string break or something, the rhythm section went into a jazz groove while Jello Biafra told a story about being a punk being harrassed by rednecks, and it's my favorite track on that album. Anything is better than 5 minutes of silence while you try to get your act together. 4) Take it up a notch - 10s are a little sturdier than 9s, which is why I tend to go 10s.  5) Take it down a notch - Do you need to strum that hard? It may look like you're playing all intense, but there's only so hard you can pluck a string before it makes no difference. There's other sorts of stagecraft to look all hard and intense and be easier on your strings. 6) Don't play with knives - I used to have these Hot Licks brass picks from Dunlop. They're thin, and they sound bright and jangly, but they're metal and don't bend, unlike plastic thin picks. I was playing acoustic rhythm in an otherwise electric rock band, with in-ear monitors, and I simply could not hear myself unless I developed a strong picking technique, which I've been trying to dial back since. But I was carving the windings off my wound G string, because I was in effect sharpening this pick to get really sharp. I like it, and I use it on electric where I have a much more mellow strumming style because I have amplification backing me up, but I moved to an unwound G on an acoustic just so I wouldn't have to change strings so often, just because I didn't realize my pick was carving up my strings. Other players may have other issues. Burrs in the saddle are common reasons why strings break. If you have a recurring string-breaking problem, the problem might be with your gear. 7) It is important - I saw Madder Rose two years later. They had another bassist. I don't know the story, but clearly, if you can play but you let the band down enough when they need you, they can find another person who can play."
Why do many songs in major keys use a bVII chord?,"I would argue that your premise that the chords used in a song should be comprised of notes that occur in the scale of the tonic key doesn't really hold.  Yes, the majority of songs tend to use almost exclusively diatonic triads, however, there are many example of non-diatonic chords, for instance, borrowed chords and secondary dominants. In traditional analysis, the bVII in a major key is considered to be a borrowed chord, meaning that it is borrowed from the parallel minor, or another parallel mode. A possibly more useful (albeit unconventional) way to think about this is that this chord is acting as sort of a IV of IV chord.  A typical chord progression with bVII looks something like this: I, bVII, IV, I.  In C major, for instance, that would be C B♭ F C.  B♭ is IV in F and F is IV in C, so there is some symmetry to this sequence, which is what makes it sound so natural.  In addition, the lowered 7th sort of ""pulls"" downward to the 6th scale degree (the third of the IV chord), making the progression from VII to IV feel very natural and satisfying."
How not to touch neighbouring strings?,"Shorten your nails as much by possible, but not by cutting. The problem with cutting them very short is that the tool compresses the fingernail and pulls it away from the skin. That causes the separation and pain. You should cut your nails only to a comfortable point, and then from there continue to shorten them by filing with a diamond file. The nails on your fretting hand will get shorter over years as you cut and file them back regularly. That is to say, the line where your nail departs from the skin will recede somewhat. Look at a side by side comparison of my left and right pinky, which I assure you started life being identical twins.  You can see that the left pinky (shown on the right) has more padding at the tip, and the nail is shorter. The changes are from playing guitar and only took a few years.   Another thing: get a guitar with a scalloped fingerboard. Or perform scalloping (or have someone do it) on an inexpensive instrument: get a $50 guitar from Craigslist, some half-round files in a couple of sizes and whittle away the fretboard. Scalloping refers to valleys that are filed in the fingerboard between the frets. The extra clearance might do the trick of allowing your nails to clear the fingerboard. Nail clearance isn't what scalloping is specifically for, but for some people, it can be one of the benefits. The purpose is so that no part of the finger comes into contact with the fingerboard. This means that all the pressure is on the string, which improves fingering, and there is no fingerboard friction, which improves bending and vibrato. Also, scalloping lets you achieve a more ideal angle against the string during a bend or vibrato.  This is a picture of what a bend looks like on a scalloped fingerboard:  This shows how a nail can clear the fingerboard. For this shot, I used my right hand, of course, whose nails are long for classical playing. "
Why are the white and black keys on the piano placed the way they are?,"Interesting question, although my answer might be more historical than you'd like ;-) One answer is that it gives you all the notes of the diatonic scale on the white keys, so by transposing to C major you can play any major-key melody that doesn't modulate using only the white keys. Another way of saying this: assume that you are working in our musical system, which has twelve-tone equal temperament as the background ""system"", but within that the diatonic major scale is the most commonly used set of pitches. Then assume that you want to have one particular diatonic scale easy to play, and that you'll put the other pitches on harder-to-reach keys. Subtract the diatonic pitches C-...-B from the set of all twelve pitches and you are left with C#/Db, D#/Eb, F#/Gb, G#/Ab and A#/Bb. Put these ""between"" the diatonic keys, in the right order in the chromatic scale, and you have something very close to the standard piano keyboard. (You can't add any more ""half-steps"" between E and F, or between B and C, without expanding your tuning beyond 12-tone equal temperament). Wikipedia and Grove Music online (subscribers only, unfortunately) note that the original organ keyboards (13th century) had only the pitches of the C major scale, plus B flat, because that made up more or less the entire pitch resources of the religious music sung at that time (and instruments would have been used only for accompanying sung music -- at least in church). On those keyboards B and B flat were both ""white keys"", with no ""black keys"" at all. The first surviving organ with a fully chromatic keyboard, from the late 14th century, still has B flat as a ""diatonic""/""white"" key. I would guess that as keyboard music developed as its own genre, it became much more useful to be able to play fast runs in the major scale -- lots of early keyboard music is based on existing pieces of vocal music with the addition of fast, ""improvisational""-sounding ornaments. At least at first, the chromatic notes would have largely been used in chords, not scales, so it would be an acceptable trade-off to have those keys harder to get to in exchange for being able to play the main scale quickly. Even quite a bit later, around 1600, there are pieces which are written in G major or F major, but where all the fast bits ignore the key signature sharps or flats and just use the diatonic keys -- it was easier to play fast scales on the ""white"" keys with the technique they used.  Finally, it's worth noting that people have often built keyboards with more than twelve tones to the octave. In the 16th century it was common to have the Eb/D# key ""split"", with the front half playing one of the two pitches (Eb) and the back half the other (D#). This was done by people who valued having perfectly-tuned chromatic notes over being able to easily navigate all scales at high speed. The extreme of this way of thinking, pre-20th century, is probably the 1555 Archicembalo, which has 36 keys to the octave! And 20th/21st century microtonal musicians have done lots of similar things. There is a nice introduction to different tuning systems both historical and modern at Kyle Gann's page."
Software that allows playing in different temperaments,"Logic Pro has built-in controls for using different temperaments.

Is it possible to write a song without a key?,"First, a key is only really a basis.  You can have an F# in a piece written in C Major without having the piece ""switch"" keys. Second, keys are defined arbitrarily.  Sure there is theory about what sounds good and that sort of thing, but at the end of the day it's just a group of notes that's just as valid as any other group of notes.  This is made clear by modes where you have 7 different scales starting on F, 7 starting on G, etc. There's also plenty of non-Western music that doesn't even use the same notes and intervals as us, so applying our concept of keys to that music doesn't make sense, although they may have their own analog to keys. And it's entirely possible to compose music outside a currently-named key.  I'll compose a song right now based on arbitrary frequencies: In sum, your question amounts to ""Is it possible to type a letter sequence that isn't an English sentence?"""
Hands-separate piano practice doesn't seem to help with hands-together playing,"Your experience is quite typical. Playing two hands at the same time is completely different than playing both separately. But the point of learning parts separately is NOT about making it easier to play both hands together. It's about learning all the ""other"" stuff (like correct hand position, articulation etc.) without having the distraction of the second hand."
Forgetting the musical notes while performing in concert,"Mistakes are inevitable.  Learning to play through mistakes is its own skill, one that has to be learned.  The technique for learning to play through mistakes is different than the technique for learning to play a piece. I've learned two ways to practice a piece: Practicing for perfection, and practicing to perform.  They compliment each other, but are done differently.   When practicing for perfection, it's important to not repeat mistakes, lest they become muscle memory.  As you probably know, if you make a mistake when learning a piece, it's important to stop, slow down, and play the difficult part correctly several times before continuing.  That's because once you've played a section wrong a few times, it's going to be muscle memory that will take a lot of work to correct.  But if, after making a mistake, you stop, slow down, and correct the mistake a few times before continuing, you'll have a much easier time of learning it correctly. Unfortunately, this way of practicing can have a side effect: It trains us to stop whenever we make a mistake.  But you must not stop during a performance.  So the way we practice to learn a piece correctly can give us a bad habit that hurts us when we play. That's why there's a second mode of practice: Practicing to perform.  After I've learned a piece using the above, careful technique, then I will practice it for performance.  During practicing for performance, there is no stopping, for any reason.  If I forget a part of it, I pick it up where I remember.  If I play a wrong note, or chord, I keep going as best I can, however I can. While practicing to perform, I remember where I goofed up, or what I forgot, or what felt difficult.  Because after practicing to perform, I go back to practicing for perfection and carefully work on the parts I had trouble with.  After which, I go back to practicing to perform again.  It's an iterative process. The key part is that every time I start to play the piece, I deliberately put myself into one of these two practice modes.  If I am practicing for perfection, then I will stop and correct mistakes.  If I am practicing for performance, then I stop for nothing. During the next practice section, I will practice the piece for performance, cold.  That's to check what it will be like when I perform it for others.  This will probably show me weaknesses which will lead to some practicing for perfection, which is followed by practicing for performance."
"Why are violin bows longer than viola bows, than cello bows, than double-bass bows ?","It actually has to do with the physics of sound production for the bowed string instruments.  The sound is produced on the viol family of instruments by the string ""slipping across"" the bow. That is, the bow catches (by friction) the string, displaces it a certain distance, until the restorative force from the tension in the string overcomes the friction and snaps back to original position (here using the common fact that static friction is stronger than dynamic friction, so once the string starts moving, it will essentially return to starting position before being caught by the bow again). Now, the pitch produced by the string is given by the frequency of the string vibration. For higher pitched instruments the frequency is higher: the string must vibrate faster. To build up resonance, you must pull the bow at the same speed as the vibration speed of the string (else you may set up destructive interference making the bowing ineffective). To attain this faster vibration, the bow needs to displace the string at a higher rate.  Therefore the typical bowing speed is higher for higher pitched string instruments. Because you bow faster on a violin, to hold the note for the same length of time without returning the bow requires a longer bow than on, say, the cello. This is why the higher pitched string instruments have longer bows. (Note that the viola bow is only marginally shorter than the violin one; the two instruments have three strings in common.)"
Is there a difference between 2/4 and 4/4,"Go for a walk. Count each step, in twos or fours. Tread heavier on the ones. One two One two One two One two One two three four One two three four They feel different, don't they? This is the difference. And yet there is an equivalence between them. Walk at the same tempo, but count to four twice as fast, so you're stepping on the One and the three. One (two) three (four) This feels like the 2/4 rhythm again, except for the in-between-steps counting you're doing. This sort of equivalence comes up all the time. In environments where musicians play without sheet music, it's quite possible that the drummer thinks he's playing in 4/4 (with triplets), while the guitarist thinks he's playing in 12/8. In this example, what the drummer calls a triplet, is three 8th notes for the guitarist. When a composer scores their music, they choose the time signature that they believe conveys the feeling most clearly to the musicians, while being easy to read. 4/4 with 4 crotchets to the bar at double the tempo. -- that's mostly a readability choice."
Etiquette of Quitting a Band,"When you quit a band, you should treat it as any other professional job. This means let them know in advance, and follow through on any commitments where not following through would leave them in a serious bind.  So if you quit a week or two before a show, be willing to do the one last show if they can’t find a quick replacement. If you’ve got a written contract with a section on leaving, follow the contract. The challenge is that quitting a small band is both quitting a job, and quitting a small social group. If all people are willing to treat you leaving as a professional decision, rather than a social rejection, it is easier to maintain good relations afterwards. In this case, it sounds like the band is not a particularly professional outfit, if the members haven’t practiced in weeks. This makes quitting professionally a little harder, since there’s no expectation of professional behavior, and if other members are treating you quitting the band as you quitting their group of friends, it is hard to persuade them that really, it’s just the music that you can’t handle, and your decision to quit really is non-negotiable. There is nothing you can do about their reactions, so just continue to make it clear there’s nothing personal in your choice. You started out well, with telling the leader why you wanted to leave. When he suggested that you stay, and things would change in a month or two and you agreed to stick around, you should have pushed for something definite. So if your biggest grievance was that rehearsals were unproductive (for example), you would give him 2 rehearsals to start improving things, and if he didn’t, you should have told him that things still weren’t working out, and given the date you would quit.  If the leader gets angry, and wants you out NOW instead of the date you suggested, you have no obligation to do that final show with him, even if he comes back begging because he can’t find your replacement in time. Highlighting the reasons for leaving is a gray area. It is potentially useful to know why someone left, but for a group like a small band, your reasons for leaving are going to come across as personal, even if it really isn’t. If you’ve been unhappy for three months, with no rehearsals in weeks, it’s safe to assume that the other band members know what’s wrong with their group. You can limit your reasons to a simple “This isn’t working out for me anymore. Been nice working with you, good luck in the future.” You’re gone. The chance that your parting words are the catalyst they need to turn their whole act around is very remote, and wouldn’t benefit you in any case. If they specifically ask for your input, give it, but otherwise, keep your opinions to yourself once you’ve left."
Why is music theory built so tightly around the C Major scale?,"1. Bias against ""unorthodox"" notes Western music tradition (and some others) was, and to a large extent still is, based on heptatonic scales, that is, seven unequal divisions in an octave. So, in a given musical context, all twelve notes are not created equal. For instance, in a musical phrase in C major, natural notes (ones with no accidentals) are the norm, others are there to add color (hence the name chromatic, from the Greek word for color). So, treating these extra notes as second class citizens makes a lot of sense. For guitar, you position your hand and set your mind to the scale given in the key signature and only break the pattern when you encounter an accidental. The presence of an ""alien"" accidental makes it obvious that you're breaking the pattern. 2. Avoiding accidentals You don't avoid accidentals. You use just as many as necessary, neither more, nor less. Even though G# and Ab sound the same in twelve-tone equal temperament, their functions are still different. For instance in a C major context, G# is a raised fifth and tends to resolve to A, like when modulating to A minor. On the other hand Ab is a lowered sixth and tends to resolve to G, like when using an Italian sixth. They are notated differently to convey this information, not to use fewer accidentals (but see the next part for an exception). If you look at it the other way, when you use the G#/Ab pitch as a modified version of the fifth degree (G), e.g. as an approach note to A, you notate it as a G#. When you use it as as a modified version of the sixth degree (A), e.g. as an approach note to G, you notate it as an Ab. It doesn't matter that they sound the same in isolation, they don't sound (feel) the same in context and it's a useful information to convey. 3. Key signatures At least half of the 30 theoretically possible key signatures are not used in practice. You will rarely encounter the ones with 7 accidentals and the ones with 8 (or more) are practically nonexistent. Enharmonic equivalents with 5 or 4 (or less) accidentals are used instead. With little practice their distinctive shapes and orderings are actually pretty easy to remember. 4. Interval qualities If I understand correctly, you imply that a system based on the number of chromatic steps would be more logical. It's not so. Like I tried to explain in the second part, G# and Ab are not equivalent. In C major, the first is an augmented fifth and the second is a minor sixth. They have very different functions. 5. Interval numbers Here, I mostly agree with you. But remember that the more mathematical system would have its problems too. Most people are not used to start counting from zero. It would still cause some confusion. Conclusion Having said all these, I have to agree that there are some shortcomings of the current musical notation. But it evolved to have its present form throughout centuries with compromises, trying to make some things easier while not making some other things unreasonably difficult. Like most compromises, it's probably not optimal but it works well in practice."
What are modes and how are they useful?,"Let's take the C Major scale which consists of C, D, E, F, G, A, B and back to C.
The bare basic way to think about the modes is: play the scale starting at another note. So, the C major scale can be played starting at C: Or starting at D: It's the same exact notes of the scale, you just start at the 2nd note & end at the second note. This is Dorian. You can keep on going; start & end on the 3rd, then the 4th, then the 5th, then the 6th and finally the 7th. Putting it all together we get 7 modes of C Major Again, you take the basic C Major scale & start & end it on another note. Same pattern, same intervals, just change where you start & end it. The usage is 100% up to you. If you want to play in C Major (continuing the example) you now have more options. You can play any of the 7 C Major modes and still be in key. Another great use of the modes is that you can string them together. Since each note shows up on the fretboard many times you can string modes together to help you move up and down the board. Play C Ionian on the 8th fret of the 6th string; when you get to the C octave on 4th string fret 10 you can then slide into 12th fret of the 4th string (which is a D) and start Dorian. Now you're starting up an octave and you've moved hand position up the board by a couple frets. You can continue that all the way thru. Creatively string together the modes (you don't have to play all the notes each time) yield you a decent little solo =)."
"My son is 6, and his guitar teacher wants me to buy him a 4/4 guitar!","I can answer this question from the kids point of view. When I was 6 I also started guitar lessons in a group of 3, just like your son. 
The first lesson I arrived with a 2/4 sized guitar and my teacher also recommended a full sized 4/4 guitar for me.
My parents got one for me and I learned for about 5 years with it. At first we only played simple melodies and learned reading notes at the same time. This took quite a while and the size of the guitar was no hindrance there at all. 
After about 1 year we started with the first chords. The songs were picked carefully and only contained easy chords. These were chords without bar chords, as pressing down more than one string at the same time with one finger is quite hard, especially for small children. Also the chords were picked so they did not contain the low E string, as reaching that one is quite hard for little hands, too. 
After some while, we learned to combine chords and melodies and only after that we got to chords with the low E string and bar chords, as we could play them properly then.  In the whole time I never had the feeling, that the guitar was too big for me or that I couldn't play what my teacher expected me to do. 
She picked the songs well and made sure we were able to play them properly despite having a slightly too big guitar. 
After a while I knew the distances which I need to shift my fingers from one note or chord to another. I am pretty sure that learning that distances again would be pretty frustrating, as it interrupts learning new songs and returns you to learning the old ones all over. With that in mind, I would recommend you to trust in the abilities of the teacher. Since he seems to teach kids for a while, I am sure he knows about the limits your son will have for a while and will look out to play songs only with notes and chords he can reach. "
Why do people sometimes write notes as E♯ or C♭?,"NReilingh gave a good general-case answer. I'll give you a specific case just to demonstrate that the concept is useful. First consider a C major chord. C-E-G, right? Then you make it into a minor chord by flattening the third, to get C-E♭-G. So far, so good. Now, consider an A♭ major chord: it's spelled A♭-C-E♭. But what happens when you want to make it minor? You need to flatten the third again, so you get A♭-C♭-E♭. You might think that it is somehow ""simpler"" to spell it as a B, but this is only superficial. It would imply, for example, that the first two notes (A♭ and B) are adjacent to each other in the scale -- that there is no note in between them (because, after all, A and B are adjacent in the alphabet). But if you look at the full scale, there is a note between them: B♭. The whole point of a ""diatonic"" scale is that you can only have a single note for each letter. So if 'B' is already used in a B♭, then the next note higher needs to be some kind of C. And since it is a half step lower than a regular C, it must be a C♭. Similarly, the whole point of a tertian chord (such as a triad) is that it's built from ""every other note"" of a scale (e.g. a ""stack of thirds""), so seeing some kind of A next to some kind of B sends a musician a signal that this isn't a proper third, and that it might instead be some type of inversion or suspension, which wouldn't be the case. So in short, you have to look at the note's position within the context of a complete scale to know how it is properly named."
What exactly does practising scales teach?,"A lot of the benefit is in how you practice them.  If done mindfully and effectively, playing scales can give you a way to focus your practice on the building blocks that make up most of the music you play. Don't think of scales as a series of notes. Instead, think of them as the foundation pieces that music is built around. Here are some examples of effective ways to practice scales. Remember, think about what you are playing. Don’t just blow through it for the sake of saying you did.  First, try playing as fast as possible. Then as slow as you can, holding each note until you run out of breathe or bow (that last bit only applies to certain instruments, obviously). Play variations Stepped scales: Play notes in patterns going up and down the scale. This will familiarize both your fingers and your ears with small chunks of notes that commonly show up in music. I'm writing out the first two examples in both note names for the C major scale, and numbers representing note positions. 1 represents the first note of whatever scale you are using. 2 the second, and so on. Examples: thirds: CE DF EG FA GB AC BD CE, 13 24 35 46 57 61 72 1 Up and down in thirds and fifths: CEGEC, DFAFD 13531 24642 35753  Up a thirds, down a scale: CEGFEDC 1354321 2465432   Up in intervals: C CDC CEC CFC CGC CAC CBC C CCC 1 121 131 141 151 161 171 More advanced (4): start at 2, then 3, then 4, etc. 2 212 232 242 252 262 272    Rhythms: Find a 2 or 4 beat rhythm you like or that you struggle with. For each note in the scale, play it in that rhythm. For more of a challenge, play a stepped scale in rhythm. Play chords: Play the most common chords associated with a key. This will probably be the I, IV, and V chords for beginners. The I chord is the major chord starting on the first note in the scale, the IV starting on the fourth, and the V starting on the fifth.      When you play a musical piece, you need to focus not only on the individual notes and phrases you play, but also on making the sound musical, and playing a desirable interpretation. Practicing scales gives you a chance to work on the smallest building blocks of music without worrying about interpretation. It also provides a very easy way to break the music down into very small pieces. You can get a lot of the same benefit by going through an entire piece of music 1 measure at a time, breaking it down into tiny pieces, but that's about as interesting to work through as scales are. The most common way to play scales it to simply blow through them mindlessly. The benefit at that point is low. It gives you a tiny, tiny bit more practice knowing where you put your fingers, and a little more benefit in that you have to think about which sharps and flats are associated with each key. Knowing what sharps and flats are in what key is extremely useful: it helps you figure out what notes are in a piece in that key, what chords to expect, that when something sounds off, and it is a note not found in the key you are playing in, that that is probably the reason. But you don't need to learn to play scales to list what notes are in what scales.  Hmm. I think I've been neglecting my scales lately: I should go practice them more."
What exactly should I have to learn to understand why certain combination of chords are harmonic when played in a sequence?,"You ask an enormously deep question that could (and does) comprise whole books of material.  I'll try to boil down the bare essentials for right now, and I'll expand on them later. My teacher told me that Joe Pass said this, although I'm sure it's probably a misquote. The sentiment, though, is right on.  There are essentially two kinds of chords, two kinds of harmonies: those that create tension and those that release it.  V chords, and all the chords that are functionally equivalent to V chords, create tension.  I chords (and their equivalents) release it.  That's the largest, most big-picture idea you should understand about harmony and how melody interacts with it. Far and away, the most common chord progression in Western music is the I-V-I.  It's so common that it sounds corny or hokey a lot of the time; it's cliché.  But it's also the most fundamental.  The I chord establishes a key center, the V chord creates tension, the I chord releases it.  All the other chord types are, in one way or another, functionally equivalent to these two.  IV chords, for example, are functionally equivalent to V chords and can be used as a lead-in to a V chord, as in the exceedingly common I-IV-V progression.  Ditto ii chords, as in the standard ii-V-I progression in jazz. I should explain about the numbers.  We use Roman numbers to mean the different chords in a certain key.  We use numbers rather than the note-names for the chords because the numbers are relative to the key rather than based on a specific root note, and therefore serve the same functional purpose no matter what key you're in.  In other words, in the key of C, the V chord (which is G7) serves the same functional purpose as the V chord serves in the key of E (in E, the V chord is B7). Okay, so how do the numbers come about?  Start by writing out a major scale; for purposes of illustration, I'll use the C-Major scale.  Its notes are: C D E F G A B C Assigning numbers to each note, starting from 1, and you get that C is 1, D is 2, E is 3, etc. Now, on each note, build a chord by stacking thirds.  For example, to build a chord on C, you build a C, an E, and a G (and in jazz, a fourth note: B).  These notes—C, E, G, B—form the I chord, so named because its root is the first note of the C-Major scale. For the second note, D, the chord is D, F, A, C, and these notes therefore make up the ii chord.  Repeat this for each note in the scale, and you'll get the following chords: You'll notice that some chords use uppercase Roman numerals and others use lowercase.  The uppercase chords are the ones that contain Major triads (C, E, G, for example) and the lowercase chords are based on Minor triads (e.g. A, C, E). The great thing about the number system is that the chords will be the same type no matter what key you're in.  This isn't some magic or convenient coincidence—it works this way because the chords are made up of notes from the major scale of the key you're in, and every major scale (by definition) is composed of the same intervals relative to its root.  For example, consider the key of E.  The scale is: E F♯ G♯ A B C♯ D♯ E Building the I chord on that, you get E, G♯, B, D♯.  That's a Major-7th chord, just as the I chord is in the key of C (C-E-G-B).  In fact, without having to think about it, I know that the I-chord in any key will always be a Major-7th chord. With this in mind, what are the types of chords for each number? This is tremendous.  I can now write chord progressions for any key and know that they'll work and how they'll sound.  I can learn a song in the key of C, show up to a jam session where the bandleader says ""let's play that in F"" and know immediately how to transpose the chords correctly.  While jamming with other musicians, I can hear someone play a dominant chord and know not only that they're creating tension, but how they're planning to release it, and I can respond accordingly. Okay, wow.  I wrote a lot more than I expected to at first.  This should get you started thinking about harmony the right way, though.  I've outlined the biggest ideas, but you should sit down with your guitar or keyboard and actually work through them.  Pick a key and find the seven chords that go with that key.  Then pick another key and do it again.  Pay attention to where the notes in each chord fit within the scale.  Play some different chord progressions, paying attention to the functional role of each chord: what number it is, whether it creates or releases tension, etc. As I said when I started, there's a ton of ideas and material to explore here, and this is just the barest of beginnings.  But it's totally worth the effort: the more study you put into understanding harmony, the more you'll hear and understand in music of all kinds."
Why is my guitar's saddle at an angle?,"The angle is there to improve the intonation.  If you've ever set the intonation on an electric guitar with individually-adjustable saddles, you'd see that the bass strings are slightly longer than the treble strings.  This is due to the gauge of the strings: heavier strings need to be slightly longer than lighter-gauge strings.  The B-string anomaly that you point out has to do with the fact that it and the high-E string are plain steel instead of wound, and so their intonation adjustment is different than for the wound strings.  Still, though, because the B-string is heavier than the E-string, it needs to be slightly longer. When you set the intonation of a string, you want the 12th fret harmonic to match the pitch of the string when fretted at the 12th fret.  But when you fret a string, you increase both its length and its tension slightly.  Given two strings of equal length, their fretted lengths will also be equal, so since the tension of a string is proportional to the product of its mass and its length, the heavier string's tension will increase more than the lighter string when fretted.  Therefore the heavier string's pitch will increase (slightly) more than the lighter string's pitch when fretted.  To compensate for this greater increase, the heavier string needs to be slightly longer than the lighter string. Update: I'll just point out that if you look closely at the photo, you'll see that the saddle itself is carved in such a way that the point of contact for the low-E string is towards the back of the saddle while the point of contact for the G string is in the front.  So not only is the saddle angled, but the strings contact the saddle itself at different points, increasing the differences between their lengths."
What is the difference between a riff and a lick?,"A riff is thematic.  It serves as the main musical idea for a (section of a) song.  Often it's repeated and developed, sometimes with variations, sometimes in different keys, but always recognizable as the same main musical idea.  Because a riff is a main theme for a song, it often becomes inextricably associated with that song---if you heard the riff out of context (say, someone trying out guitars in Guitar Center), you'd associate it with the song.  Think ""Kashmir"", ""Smoke On The Water"", or ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"".  If the song is a hit, the riff becomes quotable, and anyone else who plays the riff is making an allusion to the original song. A lick is musical idea, too, but often it's incomplete.  It might be a fragment of a solo or a portion of a riff.  By itself, it doesn't usually become thematic---in fact, a lick that forms a theme essentially becomes a riff.  A lick combines with other licks to form a complete musical idea.  Because a lick isn't the main theme, it doesn't have that same association with the song, and so it's transferable: it can be used in other songs without necessarily having to allude to the original. Here's are a few examples of what I mean: FWIW, I disagree with the idea that licks are necessarily single-note phrases.  For example, check out Joe Pass's solo in Sarah Vaughan's ""I've Got The World On A String""--- the lick I'm referring to comes at 3:01.  It's chordal, but still very much a (delicious) lick. My point is that the difference between a riff and a lick has more to do with the roles they each play in the song than whether or not they involve chords."
"How should I ""store"" my guitars?","This answer has been copied, pasted, and updated based on a related question that I answered.  I will answer your question related to hanging your guitars on the wall after I give some basic context on how to properly store a guitar in general. I think it's worthwhile to provide some context in which to answer your question. In essence, when it comes to guitars, you want to control a couple of main factors: temperature, humidity (relative), light, and outside damage. This applies to both ""artwork"" guitars and your average everyday player. How rigorous you are with this will affect the outcome of how well kept your guitar is. Temperature & Humidity A guitar is an organic instrument. It is made from wood, and wood has some interesting properties. First off, it's hygroscopic; this means it absorbs water. That makes sense based on what we know about trees :D. A guitar, despite the fact that most are sealed by either a polyurethane or a nitrocellulose finish, will absorb water from its surroundings and consequently move around a bit. Luckily, most designers and luthiers already know this--so it's highly unlikely that your instrument will warp to an unusable state just because you don't have a perfectly controlled environment. However it is recommended that you attempt to avoid extreme changes in environment--which includes both temperature and relative humidity--as these kinds of radical shifts can damage finishes of all types, cause bindings to pop loose, and all kinds of other nasties. Typically both acoustic and electric guitars like to live at anywhere from 30% to 50% relative humidity--which is good, because we humans like that range too (at least I do). Any wetter than 50% and things start to mold, and any drier than 30% and you could potentially see the finish checking or even cracking in extreme cases. Grab yourself a hygrometer, many places sell them, and at minimum be aware of the room parameters where you keep your nice guitar. No real need to be paranoid about it. I have a 1930's Kay (not worth much, but old as the hills and sounds divine with a slide) and I keep it in the same room I keep my R8, Telecaster, and Firebird. Light As with any fine piece of artwork, the constant abuse of photons on a surface can cause some wear and tear over many, many years. You can search the internet for pictures of 50's Les Pauls that used to be tobacco burst, but are now very much approaching an iced tea burst. Years of direct light can cause finishes to fade and check. Although this is highly unlikely to be a problem in most cases, if you plan on keeping a guitar for many years then place it in its case when you aren't using it and do your best to keep it out of direct sunlight. Outside Damage This is the likely reason any guitar would be damaged. Kids playing, cats being curious, or dogs being rowdy--your guitar will get a ding. The only way you can prevent this is to lock it away in a safe, or a sealed glass case. The only advice I have here is don't be super paranoid about it, and make sure to place the guitar in its case when the relatives come over. If you are truly using an expensive guitar as a piece of art--something along the lines of the PRS private stock line--and never have plans on playing it, I would recommend a glass display case. This would reduce outside sources of damage but allow you, your family, and everyone else to enjoy the beauty of the piece. If you are simply worried about your 1958 reissue getting a ding then I think a glass case or safe is likely overkill; the guitar's case will protect it adequately. Safes are useful to store very valuable guitars for future generations to enjoy, but for anything outside an original 1950's Les Paul, Stratocaster, or Telecaster/Nocaster it's not really worth the investment in my opinion. Additionally I think that you should enjoy it anyway--we all eventually take a dirt nap. If you spent a ton of money or time procuring or building ""your"" special guitar then you should enjoy it before you pass it on to the next lucky owner. Should I hang my guitars on the wall?  Well, you can--but do so with caution. Some finishes dislike the cushioning that wall mounts use and it can cause some issues. Additionally, there's a chance that your guitar might be knocked off the wall--which certainly would cause more damage than storing it in its case or keeping it on a stand. I wouldn't recommend hanging very expensive guitars without researching some sturdy, finish friendly mounts, of which I have found none. Some stands can also damage the finish of your guitar when left in contact for long periods of time, but placing an old used T-Shirt over the cushions can fix that issue (this also works on wall hangers if you go that route). In general I would recommend placing an unused guitar safely in its case or on a protected stand if you plan to play it frequently. I think that a well placed guitar can improve the aesthetics of a room quite nicely--or maybe I'm just lucky because my wife doesn't seem to mind at all :)."
Noise while not touching guitar strings or metal parts,"Your guitar is picking up mains hum. This is very common, and as you correctly surmised is due to how the components are grounded and shielded.  Usually this is simple to fix. The first items to check are:"
What's so special about minor and major scales?,"First some background if you weren't already aware: in any tonal key, say, C major, the first note of the scale, i.e. the root, is called tonic, the fifth is called the dominant, and the 7th is called the leading tone. Quite a lot of common practice harmony exists due to the properties inherent in the harmonic series. If you're not familiar, it starts with an open 5th interval, and then above it is in the shape of a dominant 7th chord. (From the bottom going up starting on C: C, G, C, E, G, Bb.) A major triad sounds the way it does because it fits into those first notes of the harmonic series. The flat 7th (in C major, Bb) actually used to be the norm, if we go back quite a ways in early music. The German musical system even today uses B to refer to what we call Bb, and H to refer to what we call B natural. In common practice, the dominant 7th is a chord that resolves to a tonic chord because chord tones only have to move by a half step . Think G-B-F (G dominant 7th) resolving to C,-C-E (C Major). These half steps are important: the B natural in C major is just a half step below the tonic, and we call it the leading tone. Another part of the answer has to do with how major and minor are generally defined by triads, not by entire scales. If you take a major scale and start planing triads up and down diatonically, you're going to get mostly major and minor chords, plus one diminished triad based on the leading tone. The fact that lots of music was written in just one key meant that major and minor were the primary chords available for use since you could make them both with the notes present in the major scale. Also, traditional minor breaks a lot of the rules of diatonic modality to fit with common practice. The flat 3rd stays the same, but if you look at a melodic minor scale, the natural 6ths and 7ths are used in addition to the flatted ones."
What is the difference between sharp note & flat note?,"Actually it depends on the instrument.
Some instruments can produce different notes for A# and Bb, others can not. There are different ways to intonate. On one side you have a just or harmonic intonation which is built on harmonics scale (each tone has a a matemathical relation between the base tone), this makes each tonality have its own intonation; on the other side you have temperate intonation which makes a compromise between frequencies and different keys, dividing the interval octave in equally distance semi-tones, to make possible one instrument to play in different keys, always using the same notes. Here is a good explanation about this. Alsto worth to read this. In practical terms, to be able to fine tune a chord (just/harmonic intonation in the guitar or different instruments playing/singing together) you must raise or lower some tones. Often the third in the chord needs adjustment. For example the third in F# chord (A#) should be higher than a Bb. If your instrument can't play it (like a piano) you land on tempered intonation, if you can play it (or bend the tone guitar/harmonica/etc) then you can get a just/harmonic intonated chord. Wheat Williams posted this very clear table on his answer to another question.
Notice how the third in the chord is higher or lower depending on the intonation model you are using. (the A# in my example of the F# major chord).  About the mathematical relation between tones in the harmonic scale:

"What makes an interval ""Perfect""?","My answer builds on the answer contributed by DR6. Based on your reaction to other very good answers posted here already, your question seems to boil down to: ""Why do humans innately feel that certain intervals are consonant"". And so much so that they are willing to call them ""perfect"". Before getting to that question, let's look at why Western culture might consider them ""perfect"". My answer to your question will be rather freeform because the truth of the matter is there is not really good answer to your question outside the music theory-based explanations given above. The modern Western music system has been inherited from some of the groundwork set by Pythagoras. It has been heavily modified to the point now that the modern 12-tone equal temperament we use now has the spirit of the original ideas from Pythagoras even if it differs greatly in many other ways. To Pythagoras, and possibly many Greeks at the time, certain intervals sounded very pleasing to the ear. Mathematically, these intervals are superparticular ratios [(n + 1)/n) or multiples [(x*n)/n]. For example, 4/3 is a superparticular ratio and 3/1 is a multiple. In other words, when the two frequencies resonate together and the ratio of the frequencies comes out in either of these forms many people in Western culture would agree they are pleasing. The perfect ratios display this quality in the best sense: 2/1 is an octave, 3/2 is a perfect fifth, and 4/3 is a perfect fourth. There is the least amount of conflict in the frequencies between the notes allowing for more complete symmetrical intersection between the waveforms. This is probably why Pythagoras liked these intervals - the Pythagoreans loved this kind of mathematical perfection. He liked it so much he tried to develop a tuning system out of it (Pythagorean Tuning) which ended being impossible without introducing a tuning error (the Pythagorean Comma).  I am not too clear on how Pythagoras's discoveries exactly carried over through time but his ideas were often used and cited by other musicologists through time. One example is Ptolemy who created scales based of Pythagorean tuning that included other less consonant intervals (thirds). What I am getting at here is that our assumption of the ""perfect"" intervals derives from the fact that the system's originator (and possibly his culture) deemed them to be perfect. It's hard to say why the name persisted through time but needless to say, thousands of tunings systems were developed after Pythagoras, most of which tried to preserve the perfect fifth, fourth, and the octave while allowing wiggle room for other intervals to fit together in the scales (I'm oversimplifying but that's the idea). But is it pleasing to humans in general? That depends. Many cultures developed other systems that don't necessarily have this obsession with the perfect intervals or used many others equally. Other cultures (Persian music) have divided the octave into 53-tones, 24-tones (some forms of Indian music), and other divisions. One response to this is that the majority of non-Western cultures tended to develop music systems that were melodically complex: complex scales over a single droning note, but not harmonically complex like Western music. So perhaps they never needed to develop the notions of ""perfect"" in the first place. There is also the fact that in the modern era we have become increasingly attracted to dissonant or unusual forms of harmony. There is widespread interest in rock/metal which emphasizes distorting the sound wave to emphasis dissonant overtones (even if the intervals actually played are quite consonant). Dubstep is not exactly harmonically pleasing either but it is popular. Modern Jazz uses some complex and dissonant forms of harmony. A lot of 20th century classical music is also very dissonant. The question comes down to if it's a matter of taste, the unexpected (things that surprise us make things interesting, a change from regularity), culture/social norms, or if it's innate. There's also a difference between enjoying dissonant music and actually finding it pleasing. I love dissonant music but I don't really find it more ""pleasing"" than consonant music - I like it because it is jarring. Music psychology and cognitive neuroscience has not come to a firm conclusion on this question. There have been a lot of studies on this topic but none are quite conclusive. One simple explanation is that evolutionarily, the human brain learned to find patterns and structure to apply semantic meaning. This means that we seek things that have regularity and predictability and attempt to assign meaning to things to help them to fit within these frameworks. Dissonant music deliberately goes outside predictable frequency ratios that line up, producing uneven sounds. Perhaps the aversion to these sounds is a by-product of the general manner in which the brain functions in the world. But this is a post hoc explanation. Cognitive neuroscience has been asking these questions for a long time and modern advances in computational neuroscience may soon provide an answer. A simple look at this question can be found in this Nature article. To summarize: We probably call it ""perfect"" because of Pythagoras and musicologists that came after him. We probably think it's ""perfect"" for cultural and social reasons. If it is really ""perfect"" to us innately is to be determined."
How does scale length affect my playing?,"For those who don't know: scale length is the length of the string from the bridge saddle to the nut: the two points of contact that define the portion of the string that vibrates to produce the sound (technically, the vibration is transmitted through to the rest of the string, but for the purposes of this discussion, we can ignore that). As for how it affects your playing: in a couple of ways. The scale length of a Stratocaster is 25.5""; the scale length of a Les Paul is 24.75"".  Imagine you took a Strat in standard tuning and capo'd it at the first fret.  The capo acts more-or-less like a new nut, shortening the effective scale length of the strings to roughly that of a Les Paul.  But it also raises the pitches of the strings a half-step.  So to get it back into standard tuning, you detune all the strings a half-step.  So the shorter scale length has caused you to reduce the tension on the strings. This relationship, of course, goes both ways.  For a given string to be tuned to a given pitch, a longer scale length will require more string tension while a shorter scale length will require less.  In practical terms, it means that if you put the same strings on a Strat and a Les Paul and tune them the same, the strings on the Les Paul will be easier to bend. Looser isn't always better, though.  7-string guitarists and 5-string bass players have long noticed that the low-B string feels ""floppy"" or ""mushy""---this is no coincidence.  It's a direct result of the fact that the scale length of most guitars and most basses is too short for the low-B to have enough string tension to feel good. The tighter the string, the more it produces higher overtones.  This means that tighter strings will sound brighter and have more definition, while looser strings will sound warmer and rounder. IMHO, in the long discussion of why Strats sound different than Les Pauls, scale length is often an overlooked factor.  Single-coil vs. humbucker, alder/ash vs. mahogony, bolt-on vs. set-neck---sure, all of these make a difference.  But a Strat is also almost a full fret longer than a Les Paul, and that's a big reason why Strat's sound so clear and bell-like on the bottom end, perhaps harsh on the top end, while Les Paul's sound mushy and indistinct on the low end but warm and round on the top.  It's also why sticking a PAF humbucker on a Strat and gluing the neck to the body still won't make it sound like a Les Paul. As I mentioned earlier, 7-string guitarists and 5-string bassists have struggled with the low-B string since these instruments were first developed.  6-string bassists have it the worst, since the high-C string is almost the same pitch as the D-string on a guitar, yet is almost 10"" longer and also has a heavier gauge to boot.  Most 4-string basses have a 34"" scale length, while many 5- and 6-string basses have a 35"" scale length to give the low-B string more tension and definition, but really, a 35"" 6-string bass is the worst of both worlds. I've seen string sets for 7-string jazz guitarists that use flat-wound strings for the E, A, D, and G strings, but a round-wound for the low-B in an effort to produce more definition.  To me, this seems like an admission of defeat. Pianos are shaped the way they are for a reason: bass strings simply have to be longer than treble strings.  Violins, violas, mandolins, cellos, double-basses: these all have a range of an octave-and-a-sixth between their highest and their lowest strings.  The truth is that a guitar, with a range of two octaves between its lowest open string and its highest, is pushing the limit of what a uniform-scale-length string instrument can get away with.  Extended-range guitars and basses really don't work all that well (sorry!  I love them too!). But what if you could design an instrument so that the bass strings were longer than the treble strings?  Then the bridge and the nut could no longer be parallel, and neither could the frets, so instead you get a fret layout that looks like a Chinese fan.  But it works!  To give just one example: a Dingwall 6-string bass's scale lengths go from 37"" on the low-B to 33.25"" on the high-C.  It looks goofy, but it's totally playable and sounds great. Once upon a time, I designed an eight-string guitar (turns out, so have many others before me) with a low-A and a high-A.  And as it turns out, there's just no way to make that instrument practical without fanning the frets.  Otherwise the low-A sounds like mush and the high-A both sounds harsh and breaks all the time.  But the fanned-fret instrument sounds amazing and has unbelievable range: it's almost piano-like."
Appreciating the music of J. S. Bach,"I'd say 2. is likely the closest, but it may just be as simple as personal taste. You're just not that used to hearing it and as you say, there's no emotion associated with it. I doubt I'd be capable of appreciating the subtle nuances and emotions in Indian Raga and I can't imagine such a melody stirring any great emotion in me. We have sounds and dissonances today which Bach would have hated - not because he wouldn't be able to ""comprehend"" it, but because it's not what he'd be used to. But the thing that fascinates me about music is that you can enjoy it in spite of your level of understanding - no matter how small (or great) that understanding may be, which is why I think you should rule out your reasons 1. and 3. For example, a non-musician might simply appreciate the Passacaglia and Fugue in C minor (BWV 582) because it sounds ""dark and moody"". An organist might enjoy it because it has a double fugue subject, a musicologist might enjoy it because the pedal ostinato may have been ""borrowed"" from French composer André Raison. A lot (all?) of Bach's work is academically very clever and your comment that ""it just seems like scales coming one after the other and one over the other"" is almost testament to the genius of his work - it sounds deceptively simple and neat, yet when you dig beneath the surface it's vastly complex. If you don't like it, you don't like it - no point in ""training"" yourself to like it! But if you want to give yourself a chance at maybe seeing something you've missed so far, maybe study his The Art of Fugue series of works and see how the complexity builds up. Failing that, why not just have a dance?!

Why shouldn't I put electric guitar strings on my acoustic guitar?,"The answer is that electric strings are generally too light a gauge to properly ""drive"" the guitar. You need a heavy gauge string to provide the force needed from the vibrations to get the proper action out of the top to produce good volume and resonance. Unlike an electric, where the vibration is picked up directly from the string passing over a magnet, an acoustic relies on the vibration of the string causing rapid changes in the tension placed on the bridge by the strings. This pulls on and then relaxes the top of the guitar, moving the top up and down to amplify the string's vibration, and then those vibrations are transferred to the air in the resonating chamber, which ""fine-tunes"" the waveforms to produce the final sound at full volume. In this regard, you can think of an acoustic guitar top as a speaker cone, only powered by a string instead of a magnetic transducer. Given the above, the guitar will get its best resonance and dynamic range using a set of strings that are balanced in tension with the tension inherent in the structure of the top. This allows the instrument at rest to be in a balanced state of tension between the strings and suspension. That allows the top its full range of motion, and additionally a string that can balance the top will also be thick enough to have a very high range of force that the changing tension of the string's vibration will place on the top. Think of the string as a spring, just not coiled; the thicker the metal, the greater the force needed to stretch it from its resting state. Using the proper gauge of string will provide the large changes in the force of the vibrating string needed to move the top of the guitar and produce its full sound. Using a string that is too thin will provide insufficient force from the vibration to properly ""drive"" the top of the guitar, and the sound of the guitar will suffer. This is why ""light"" acoustic strings are roughly equal in gauge to ""medium"" or even ""medium-heavy"" electric strings. The electric strings, because they're used in a design where the primary sound is produced by directly detecting the string's vibration electrically, don't have to be as thick. So, they aren't, allowing rock gods to shred with greater speed because they don't need to press as hard."
How can I teach a student who seems to have no rhythm?,"I think @Ulf is on the right track--I'll elaborate here. It sounds like your student is at the point where you'll need to work on the absolute basics of rhythm. Before you get anywhere near subdivisions, time signatures, even the concept of a quarter note, your student needs to become proficient with steady beat. This is, in many ways, the concept that kindergarden general music teachers spend the entirety of their year working on. If all else fails, then the Eurhythmics idea is where you want to look. Everyone has an innate internal clock so that we don't fall over when walking from point A to point B. You've got to use this to ""bootstrap"", essentially, his musical rhythm. You may have to work backwards at first, have him walk around the room at a steady pace, and play some music on your guitar that matches with his pace. Eventually, you'll have him go in the other direction, having him change his walking pace to match the music that you are playing. You should use a little tempo variation from example to example, but make sure you're playing at a speed that is easily walkable. Too fast or too slow and the exercise will fail. After that part is learned, then you can add steady beat claps while walking, and go from there. Eurhythmics is the approach to music education developed by Émile Jaques-Dalcroze. There are other approaches, and most educators will use different components of each for different concepts. You should be able to find more resources and examples by Googling Dalcroze Eurhythmics."
What are the benefits of guitars with fanned frets?,"The idea of fanned frets is, in essence, to combine the baritone or bass guitar with the regular guitar in one instrument. Fanned frets enable strengthening the tone of the lower strings by giving them a longer speaking string length. They can also enable a high string that can be tuned higher than is possible on a conventional guitar by giving it a shorter vibrating length, enabling a higher-tuned string that won't break under the tension. In the modern era the technique was first used on an 8-string guitar designed by classical guitarist Paul Galbraith and built by luthier David Rubio. Galbraith wanted an instrument where he could play notes one 5th lower than on a standard 6-string, and one 4th higher as well, adding a full extra octave to the instrument. He called his design the ""Brahms guitar"" because he found he could play convincing arrangements of Brahms solo piano repertoire on his instrument. He then built up his own repertoire of arrangements where he plays solo classical guitar with lower bass parts and a fuller sound.  Bartolex 8-string fanned-fret classical guitar Low ""A"" to high ""a"" Next up came Charlie Hunter, who worked with luthier Ralph Novak to create an 8-string electric guitar that has the range of the regular 6-string but also adds a full octave lower. (This design has a longer scale length enabling the extra bass range, but doesn't enable any higher notes). Charlie Hunter plays in a style where he covers the range of both the bass guitar and the electric guitar all by himself (Ralph Novak's slogan is ""Fire you bass player""). Hunter usually performs with just himself and a drummer.

Wes Lambe Guitars Ralph Novak (Novax) A well-known company that makes more hard-rock oriented guitars The technique of fanned frets has also been applied to the conventional 6-string guitar and the conventional 4, 5 and 6-string bass guitar. The theory here is that the lowest strings and the lowest notes make a stronger, fuller sound by giving them extra vibrating length, and the upper strings get a brighter, clearer sound by giving them a shorter vibrating length. The best example is Dingwall bass guitars, whose low ""B"" string has a scale length of 37 inches (940 mm), while a conventional bass guitar with a low ""B"" string has a scale length of 34 or 35 inches (864 mm or 889 mm)  Dingwall Leland Sklar signature 5-string fanned-fret bass guitar Low ""B"" to high ""G"""
How can I train my ear for music?,"It's absolutely possible, based on personal experience. I was essentially tone-deaf before starting interval training, and now have no problem recognizing notes and playing songs by ear. It provides a major advantage because you only need to figure out one note of the song. The next note can always be identified if you can recognize its interval from the previous note! I also recommend trying to playing/singing along with songs.  It's easier to recognize notes when you know how they physically feel as well as sound, and I've found that playing with songs is the best way to learn to play by ear.  You can clearly hear when you play the wrong notes (most of the time), and it's easier to experiment until it sounds right and write down / remember the note that you played, rather than trying to determine it purely by listening.  Eventually I found that I was able to start picking up notes just from listening."
Polymeter vs Polyrhythm,"Hopefully these examples of 5/4:4/4 polymeter and 5:4 polyrhythm clears it up. Polymeter
Here is a simple example of 5/4 over 4/4 polymeter notated in 4/4 time. Notice how voice A's meter is five beats (the accents illustrates the starts), while voice B's meter is four beats, and they are sort of modulating over each other. After 20 beats their accented beats will coincide again. Important is that the beat tempo is the same for both voices!
 Here is the same example but notated in 5/4 time:
 You could also notate voices A and B each with a different time signatures (explicit polymeter notation), but it might look confusing if you're not used to it when the bar lines don't line up inbetween the staves. Polyrhythm
Here is a simple example of 5:4 polyrhythm notated in 4/4 time. Notice how both voices coincide and have emphasis on the first beat of each measure (or rather each complete beat ratio). Important is that the beat tempo is different between the two rhythms of voice A and B!
 Here is the same example but notated in 5/4 time:

What does a triangle mean in chord notation?,"It's a major 7th chord! C△7 would be C, E, G, and B♮."
What does this note - B# - mean?,"In a key where there are already some sharps (or flats) in the key sig., as here, every time one of those notes is played, it has to be sharp (or flat). In E, or C#m, the key here, every other note is natural - E, A, and B. So if a note sounding like a C needs to be played, it can't just be written as a C, because the player would automatically sharpen it, to play C#.  So there are two ways to write this actual note: C natural or B sharp. It will depend on the technical nature of things, like what would that note have been before it needed to change. If, for example, the harmony underneath produced an augmented chord, where E, G#, B became E, G# B# that would be how it was written. If, on another tack, the chords underneath went from A maj. to Amin., then the changed note would not be C# any more, but C natural.Thus spelling the chord properly, even though it's only one note out of that chord. On the face of it, it seems unnecessary, but from a technical point of view, it is correct. Lots of players would probably be just as happy reading a C natural, but the next glitch MAY be that any subsequent C# in the bar would then have to have an accidental written in, which is extra stuff to read."
Why can't I play with a backing track or other musicians,"From my experience, start really simple. I started with a metronome, and played a familiar piece at a variety of tempo's to get me used to listening to the beat and playing the notes in the right time as a result of an external influence. Move up to a simple backing track cd with a strong beat, something like a blues backing track for beginners. Keep going with it, you'll get used to it eventually. Playing along with others and keeping in time with them really threw me off to start with, it's still quite difficult until I've settled into it."
Why do pianos not need to be tuned every time you play?,"Piano strings are attached to a cast iron frame, also known as harp. Cast iron is much less sensitive to humidity and temperature changes than wood. This is the main reason why they stay in tune relatively well. In contrast, harpsichords are somewhat similar but their frames are made of wood and they require much, much more tuning. Other factors are that that pianos aren't usually moved and won't get knocked out of tune. They usually require tuning after moving. The metal strings are stable once initially settled, unlike synthetic or gut strings. Playing the piano also doesn't involve touching the strings with your hands, which puts dirt and moisture on the strings."
How high from the ground should the keyboard from a piano be?,"The exact height of the keyboard off the floor is less important than the distance between the keyboard and your seat. (Most chairs are too low to the ground to be good as a piano stool) I'd agree with @Jeffrey that forearms-parallel-to-the-floor is a good starting point, also that your knees don't get wedged out of the way by the bottom of the keyboard. One other thing-- in my experience, most students sit too close to the keyboard. (This may have to do with sitting at a desk most of the time, or with sitting at a piano for the first time while small and then gradually growing and not resetting one's idea of a best distance.)"
Brandenburg Concerto No. 5 in D: Why do some recordings seem to be in C sharp?,"Tuning forks, invented in 1711, standardised tuning. (A student of mine used to call them pitchforks...) Trouble was, there was no standardised pitch for the note,that came much later. So various forks ranged from 400 - 450Hz, depending where they were made/used. I guess musicians didn't travel too far for engagements, so discrepancies in 'concert pitch' didn't matter too much, as long as everyone in one orchestra was tuned similarly. Recordings had hardly taken off by then, but much later, when an orchestra did a recording, probably for the sake of authenticity, it would tune to what was considered the tuning of the original piece. Very difficult to ascertain, sometimes, so personal choice by the conductor was made. There was also the mechanical transcription of an already recorded piece, from tape to whatever other medium, which meant that the tape may have stretched slightly, or the speed at the time of recording was not exactly the same as that on playback. This shows in so many pop songs from '50s and '60s. Sometimes accidental, others on purpose, trying to enhance the feel of a number."
Why is the lowest note on the piano an A?,"Early pianos started out with the existing range of harpsichords, having between four and five octaves, usually starting at low C.  This stands to reason, because Bartolomeo Cristofori, generally credited with being the inventor of the piano, was an expert harpsichord maker.  By the time of Mozart, the range had standardized to five octaves, starting with the F below low C, a sixth above the bottom A on modern pianos. Beethoven's favorite piano was the Broadwood ""fortepiano"", of which many replicas exist and on which performances of Beethoven's music are often heard.  For reference, I will mention that, in school after hearing a performance of some of Beethoven's sonatas on such a replica, four piano students and the pianist took the legs off of it and lifted it into the back of the pianist's van.  Not the same instrument as we have today! Now, Beethoven wasn't always happy with the limitations of the keyboard range.  There are all sorts of famous examples in his sonatas of his working around these limitations, leading to scholarly arguments on whether it's ok to add in some of the notes that he left out in performance. (Here's an interesting article on the subject.)  The pianos kept adding keys during Beethoven's life, extending from five to seven octaves by 1820 or so, and some of his later work incorporates some of the new notes.  So, it can be argued that Beethoven provided at least some of the impetus to expand the range beyond that current in his lifetime. Eventually the range stabilized at what we have in the present.  Part of the reason we don't have higher notes is that the strings would have to be too short to accommodate the requirements of the action.  Also, at the higher end of our audible spectrum, it's difficult to distinguish between pitches, so perhaps part of the reason is that further extension probably wouldn't yield much musical value anyway. On the low end, the impetus to expand the range slowed down as we began to get to the low end of the audible spectrum.  The low end of the audible spectrum is generally said to be somewhere between 15 and 20 Hz.  Now, the lowest A on the modern piano is about 27.5 Hz, which is getting close to the edge of our ability to hear.  Adding nine notes on the biggest Bösendorfer gets the lowest note down to 16.5 Hz, which can be barely heard if at all by most people. In the very low notes, most (if not all) of what can be heard is actually the overtones of the note.  That's why they sound a bit ""muddy"".  The existence of lower notes than are generally used adds to the resonance of higher notes, so that's also one of the reasons that we have them. To demonstrate this, here are two examples from piano literature that actually use the lowest A.  The first one is Debussy's Isle Joyeuse, and the note occurs on the last note of the piece.  Skip to the end, and if you listen to it, you'll notice that the note itself is a bit unclear.  You know what note it is partly from the context of the rolled chord--the chord tells you where it's going, if you will. 

 The next one is Brahms' Rhapsody Op. 79 No. 2.  Look at the last quarter note in the second measure, and even more strikingly on the next page, second line, last measure where the fermata is.  You'll notice that the doubling of the A with the next octave up gives it more of an ""A feeling"" than you have in the Debussy piece. 

 So, to sum up my answer: pianos have evolved to the point where the pitch range is pushing the envelope of useful pitches, given the limits of audible range, how we hear pitch, and the nature of the piano tone.  The two largest Bösendorfer models notwithstanding, adding more keys to the piano doesn't add much in the way of usable musical materials."
Why is the bridge pickup on a Stratocaster angled?,"In short, to give a better treble response (the closer to the bridge, the more trebley the sound). It reduces bass that may ruin the sound, and gives a twangier brighter sound without sounding muddy. Fender were the first ones to introduce it, with the Broadcaster (later Telecaster) and it was such a great idea that it was put on the Stratocaster, and has been a standard ever since. "
Are there any music programming languages from after the SuperCollider era?,"There are indeed new languages, as well as libraries within other languages. I'm going to list a few that spring to mind off the top of my head, and maybe come back and expand my answer later. edit 03/17: I have slightly revised the answer.  Notable that to a great extent, SuperCollider is often used as a back-end for systems based in a range of languages & paradigms; in some cases, systems that a few months ago when I originally wrote this used their own audio engines now use scsynth. edit 04/21: Adding SOUL to the list, but also worth mentioning that in the interim I believe WebAudio & WebAssembly are maturing well. There is now a WASM build of scsynth that I should really play with more, I'm not sure how much adoption it has so far."
How do I use a metronome?,"Make Sure it doesn't become a crutch:
The most important thing about practicing with a metronome is to avoid becoming dependent on it. It is a tool that can be used to strengthen your rhythm and time when used properly, but if you overuse it, you might become uncomfortable playing without one because the machine is creating the pulse instead of you. As a tool for improving your rhythm, you can do the following: When you say you have trouble playing on the beat, this is something that needs to be fixed. You want to be able to play with near-perfect computer-like rhythm and then add flexibility in expression after that. Then, as a next step, once your rhythm is very solid, you can set the metronome to larger beats (say one beat per measure). Top musicians who have expressive flexibility in their rhythm will still have a very solid larger beat. This technique is also good for finding sections in which you tend to rush or drag. If you finish the measure before the metronome, you are rushing. If you finish after the metronome, you are dragging. Some metronomes can't do this because they don't get slow enough, but with a computer or a Dr. Beat you can set it to only beat the first beat of each measure. You can also do things like having the metronome on off-beats and/or subdivisions instead of the downbeat. For example, you might start a section or piece of music in-between the metronome beats so the metronome is on the second eigth note subdivision and not on the first. You can use your imagination for variations like triplets and sixtinth note subdivisions. Learn Rhythm Away From Your Instrument:
Lastly, if you find staying with beat hard, practice the rhythms away from your instrument with clapping (This is particular important as a Beginner). This allows you to focus on the rhythmic problems at hand without the complication of notes. If you have issues on a particular measure or rhythmic, you can clap that particular rhythmic or beat over and over again a little bit each day until you get it. This is a very important practicing technique: reduce the problem and work on the simplest possible manifestation of that problem first (If you a programmer, think of this as divide and conquer). You might also trying walking around the room with each step being a beat in sync with the metronome, and then clapping the rhythms while doing that. The end goal here is to internalize the pulse and rhythms as much as possible (This training idea comes from Eurhythmics and is generally very effective). Since, as a piano player, you have to play multiple rhythms at once, you can extend this by walking with the beat, doing one rhythm in one hand by hitting your chest with that hand, and the other rhythm in the other hand by hitting your chest with that hand as well."
Can wind instruments be played out of tune?,"Yes, wind instruments can play out of tune, even when the instrument is ""tuned properly"" (which isn't as well-defined as it seems). In fact, the same can be said for fretted string instruments as well.  For wind instruments, the way you blow into the instrument can drastically affect your pitch. As a flute player, I can vary between as much as a whole step above and below the note I'm fingering by basically just rotating the instrument. I've heard single-reed (saxophone and clarinet) players slide up an octave without changing fingering. For brass instruments, you can get a lot of different pitches out of each fingering due to the nature of the instrument and the interaction with the mouthpiece. I would say, in general, that playing out of tune is the default situation for all wind instruments, and playing in tune requires a lot of practice and very good ear. For fretted string, the amount of pressure you put on your fretting hand affects the pitch. It's not as much as an intentional bend, but it can be up to a quarter step or more, and definitely enough to sound out of tune even to untrained ears. This issue become much more pronounced with scalloped frets. It's not as much of a concern as wind instruments, however, because it's a universal solution: fret lightly and you will stay in tune, vs. wind instruments needing to take care of many different things for each note and situation they are in. The instruments which cannot (without effort) play out of tune are non-fingered string instruments (harp, dulcimer, lyre), percussion instruments (drums, keyboards, auxiliary), and those instruments which are somehow both (piano, harpsichord, celeste). These instruments are all basically just a set of pretuned objects which are vibrated by picking, plucking, or striking to create the sound. Assuming those objects are in tune and you aren't going out of your way to touch or bend them inappropriately, they will play in tune. However, you can make them play out of tune in various ways, but it will not be an accident, and may be harder than playing in tune."
It is ok to correct wrong notes when playing piano?,"My teacher instructed me to think of two different approaches to practice: ""Stop"" -- where you are trying to learn the piece, work out the fingering (or other technical aspects) etc.  You're not too concerned with keeping time, and when you make a mistake you stop, go back (maybe to the beginning of the phrase) and fix it.  This mode allows you to fix in your mind the whats and the hows of the piece. ""Go"" -- where you are trying to perform the piece through.  Here you are trying to keep time and need to just blow by any mistakes that you make.  This mode is what allows you to actually perform the piece. As you work through a piece you need to switch back and forth between these two approaches: ""stop"" to initially learn the piece, ""go"" to get into the flow with it, back to ""stop"" when you identify sticking points etc.   Some additional notes: ""Go"" is not necessarily ""go fast"";  often you'll want to be able to go through the piece at a slow pace (blowing through errors) as part of the process of getting it up to speed. Sometimes sticking points are symptoms of insufficient ""Stop"" practice -- you haven't constructed a firm idea of the what and the how, and thus cannot execute it musically. Depending on where you are and what you are trying to do, you can/should apply whichever of these complementary approaches is most useful."

B flat minor - the key of death ... seriously?,"Music has nearly infinite potential for subtlety, and yes, drums might seem more simple on the surface, but after a few years in music school you'll be tuning drum heads every time you sit down at a snare drum, have a mallet collection that weighs 30 pounds, and enjoy discussing the relative merits of different origin rosewood on your marimba. Most people have some sense of absolute pitch, even if it's just a subconscious association of things in the key of Bb minor with other things in the key of Bb minor. And yes, in a perfect equal temperament world (i.e. electronic music) every transposition is functionally the same as any other. However, different instruments respond differently in different keys, both as a consequence of their construction (open strings) and despite centuries of work to make timbre as consistent as possible. However, I think the most compelling argument is the least subtle of all the above, and that is that up until the mid-18th century, classical keyboard music was not played in equal temperament! It was played in well temperament, which, like equal temperament permitted music to be played in all keys, but did not completely equalize every interval, so that every key did have a distinct (and distinguishable) ""flavor""."
Rest above a note in a piano piece,"Let's look at what going in the bass clef. You are playing a B for beats 1 and 2 and then playing another B on beat 3, but you also play a D for beats 2 and 3 in the bass. Because you play the D on beats 2 and 3 and the B is also being played on beats 1 and 2, the rest is used to show you what beat to start playing the D. Without the rest in, the notation would tell you to play the D for beats 1 and 2 instead of 2 and 3. The rest is necessary to show where to play the D. It looks odd, but it's the best way to notate what is happening. If the lower staff was written as two separate parts in the bass they would look like this:"
What is the definition of 'playing in the pocket'?,"You're on the right track. It's actually a combination of some of the elements that you've mentioned. If the band is not playing together, then they won't be ""in the pocket"", this much is clear. It goes a bit deeper than just simply staying together and playing at the same tempo. It can also be song-based, meaning it's dependent on the tempo of the song. Let's say that the most comfortable tempo for Song A is 70BPM, but the band is playing at around 63BPM. The song will feel like it's dragging and that sensation of ""playing in the pocket"" will not be achieved even if the band is perfectly together! To add to your point about playing together, the bass player and drummer really need to work together, especially in more syncopated songs, to achieve rhythms that match. This is not an absolute rule, but the rhythm of the bass and bass drum tend to match."
Can I play pipe organ as a pianist?,"The black and white bits are the same, except you will probably only get 49/61 of them instead of the 88 you're probably used to. The action will be rather different, too. No matter how loudly or quietly you try to play, the volume will remain the same. There is no sustain pedal, so that will be different, too. You'll have to acclimatise yourself to playing with your two hands on separate boards. Instead of the sustain pedal, you'll use your right foot on a swell pedal, but once set, it can be left alone - till you accidentally knock it!! Don't bother with the pedals, that's a skill for another day. A basic knowledge of what the stops do will make what is played more listenable - using the same sound for everything gets quite boring. Certainly get some practice in before the big day. Good luck!"
Why is a grand piano better than an upright piano?,"It's all about the size, and therefore the length of the strings and the size of the vibrating surface of the wooden soundboard. Even a baby grand at ~5 feet is longer than a typical upright is tall. A concert grand at 7-10 feet is much, much longer. I can't do any better than what Wikipedia says, so I'm going to quote wholesale: All else being equal, longer pianos with longer strings have larger, richer sound and lower inharmonicity of the strings. Inharmonicity is the degree to which the frequencies of overtones (known as partials or harmonics) sound sharp relative to whole multiples of the fundamental frequency. This results from the piano's considerable string stiffness; as a struck string decays its harmonics vibrate, not from their termination, but from a point very slightly toward the center (or more flexible part) of the string. The higher the partial, the further sharp it runs. Pianos with shorter and thicker string (i.e. small pianos with short string scales) have more inharmonicity. The greater the inharmonicity, the more the ear perceives it as harshness of tone. Inharmonicity requires that octaves be stretched, or tuned to a lower octave's corresponding sharp overtone rather than to a theoretically correct octave. If octaves are not stretched, single octaves sound in tune, but double—and notably triple—octaves are unacceptably narrow. Stretching a small piano's octaves to match its inherent inharmonicity level creates an imbalance among all the instrument's intervallic relationships, not just its octaves. In a concert grand, however, the octave ""stretch"" retains harmonic balance, even when aligning treble notes to a harmonic produced from three octaves below. This lets close and widespread octaves sound pure, and produces virtually beatless perfect fifths. This gives the concert grand a brilliant, singing and sustaining tone quality—one of the principal reasons that full-size grands are used in the concert hall. Smaller grands satisfy the space and cost needs of domestic use. Really tall uprights do exist, but they're not very common. They are sometimes referred to as upright grands. Of course, whether inharmonicity is good or bad is purely subjective. That classic ""pub piano"" sound, fits perfectly with some kinds of music. It's the sound of an upright, and probably couldn't be replicated on a concert grand."
How to turn any (pop) song into a jazz song?,"Before you replace chords with 3 or 4 notes with those with 5 or 6 notes (or even more), re-harmonize a melody by applying these 2 complementary strategies recursively (i.e. each is applicable to the result of applying them, so you can do it in many passes) to chord changes: While you do so, make sure every step of the way, your chord substitution works with the melody: there is no one-size-fit-all replacement for something like 1-5-6-4 because it all depends on the melody. Why would you want to do 2) if you want your 'pop' chord changes to sound more 'jazzy'? That is because simplifying changes allows you to complexify them later IN ANOTHER WAY (e.g. add passing chords, etc.) to your taste. Tactics for 1) are: Directions for 2) are: Using these strategies involves trial-and-error (so the more you do it, the more proficient you would be at getting to a solution you like), and doing it with your instrument, score AND PENCIL helps. After you have re-harmonized a 'pop' melody using the mentioned strategies, you are ready to 'jazz it up'. By having done the re-harmonization that way, you would have already noticed what scales are implied by the chord changes and the melody from moment to moment in the song. Use those scales to construct chords with more notes to replace the simpler version by starting with the given root and stacking 3rd's up.  For example, if the scale is C minor and the current chord's root is F, the chord (spelled from bottom up) can be F A (or Ab) C Eb G B(or Bb) D. Then look up the symbol for your the chord you want (from a guitar chord chart book or software or webpage  etc.) and/or start considering the voicing of the chord (esp. if you are doing it on keyboard or something like it - like xylophone). But what if you have chosen chromatic (passing) chords in your solution? In that case, figure out what scale is implied by your current (and chromatic) chord, and use that instead to construct your 'more-jazzy' chord just for the moment. The reason why some chord changes sound more 'jazzy' is because they manage to make the listeners think of a key (which implies a scale) in mind by structuring phrases or sections that boil down to a simple cadential formula, but 'on the surface' ('above' that 'boiled-down' level) from measure to measure (or even from beat to beat) they use as many chromatic (i.e. outside of the scale) pitches as possible. It is a tricky balancing act because if you CONSTANTLY use only pitches outside the key, eventually the listeners' mind would flip to deem those pitches as defining a new key. So, to created that jazzy impression, don't just go for those 'outside the key' pitches; instead, keep enough 'inside the key' pitches to trick the listeners into thinking of a key, while staying one step ahead by surprising them with pitches 'outside' of their expectations IN-BETWEEN. For a 'pop' audience, some tactics to do so are:"
How does your brain learn to play the piano two-handed?,"It depends on the individual, but I'm going to talk about my own experience. Two things to note: Going back to the first point, it's common to learn the left-hand part on its own, then the right-hand part, then put them together. However when you put them together, it's not really a case of disassociating one hand's job from the other's and setting them off independently. Let's take as an example the first few bars of the melody section of ""Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy"", in a simple arrangement.  I might try out the left hand part then the right hand part -- to work out the fingering -- but to put them together I would not try to set my left hand off playing E, B, E, C, etc. while independently the right hand plays the melody. Instead I would note that the order of things is: ... and so on, a linear sequence of single notes and chords, played by a combination hands. The difficulty of playing with both hands is seeing the order of events as they're shared between the hands -- does my left hand do something before the next right hand event, or do I play a right hand note first, or am I playing the next combination of notes with both hands at the same time? Just like learning to read, when you're a beginner, you have to think about every step. I find it useful to try playing with both hands very slowly and with no regard to a consistent tempo -- just get the notes in the right order. With experience, this gets easier, and if you do it a lot, you'll find that you can do it without thinking -- again, just like reading. Another mode of piano playing is improvising an accompaniment, perhaps by playing some chord rolls you've learned while playing the melody with the right hand. In this case, learning where the beats are in the roll, and therefore where a melody fits around it, is part of learning the roll. Practice is everything."
"Is it recommended to learn a piece you really like, but is way above your level?","Hopefully a personal anecdote as an answer is helpful: I was forced to take piano lessons when I was young. When I became a teenager, my parents made it my choice whether to continue and I chose to stop piano lessons. I did not find it exciting or fun, it was just pressing keys in a certain order every day and ""making music"" that I didn't recognize and didn't care about. At age 19, I had fallen in love with the band Led Zeppelin and just had to try playing guitar. I loved it right away and one of the things that kept me going and learning and playing every day was that I chose the songs and I had fun and did what I wanted. One of the first songs I chose to learn, after playing for only three months or so, was ""Under The Bridge"" by Red Hot Chili Peppers, which is a very hard song.  In retrospect it took me three to four years before I could really play ""Under The Bridge"". In the meantime, I worked on it almost every day and I also played around with many much easier songs. Upsides: Downsides: Generally, I recommend to my students that they chase what they love, no matter how difficult it seems, but also that they reserve some time for working on techniques and ergonomics so they can play better than they currently play, not just more songs."
How can I learn to compose?,"Don't get hung up on 'learning theory' or 'not learning theory'. What you want to do is gain knowledge about music, so you can use that knowledge to produce music. In the field of music, some of that knowledge tends to get packaged under the heading of 'theory', and some doesn't... but so what? what aspects of music theory should I learn first? Learning just a little bit of theory can be 'dangerous' - we get lots of people on this site who have read a bit of theory and get very confused. Partly this is because lots of aspects of 'standard' music theory arguably don't make much sense! The way music theory is commonly taught tends to mix up genuine music fundamentals, culture-specific terminology and notation, and style-specific musical advice into one big pot. Also, (as with most natural language), there are many terms that have rather uncertain meanings, or multiple meanings in different contexts, or different meanings to different people. I'd advise you to learn as much as you possibly can, as quickly as possible, and not to get too hung up on any aspect. You'll probably need to go round it all quite a few times before it really starts to come together in your mind. ...so I know the notes? There are lots of ways to 'know the notes'. You can know them as positions on a guitar fretboard, frequencies in Hz, dots on a score, midi note numbers, piano keys, frequency ratios relative to a root... ultimately you'll come to learn all of these ways. time signatures ...certainly something you'll learn. Don't get hung up on them though... they're just one way of expressing a deeper 'truth' about music, which you will also learn. or do I learn an instrument? As the music you've said inspires you is traditional instrumental music, I would say yes, have a go! Try a few and see if any of them suit you. And if they don't, and you still want to compose, no problem!  Composition is something you can never fully learn - there's too much to know. At the same time, even a newcomer to music can pick out a pleasing melody on an instrument, and perhaps with a bit of trial and error, add an accompanying line, and come up with a pleasing composition. So it's going to be one of those things that is ""a journey, not a destination"". Having said that, a composer IMO is someone who actually gets their pieces out there into the world! So while you may not feel that every piece is something you want to share, you may want to consider if you'd like to write for someone other than yourself - and if so, who, and how are you going to get your music into their ears? Writing music that no-one else ever listens to can be a hard habit to break."
"When tuning a guitar, should you always end with tightening the string rather than loosening it?","When you lower the pitch by releasing tension, there might be slack in the gears in the tuning machines, which might make the string go below the intended pitch. By going further down and approaching the target note from below, there will be force applied to the gears and when you've reached the correct pitch the gears have less potential to move. So your teacher is correct."
How to play songs that contain one guitar when we have two or more guitarists?,"Some alternatives from the top of my head There's a lot of fun to be had, and better music to be made, when band members coordinate their playing and singing like this, trying to make the whole group work as one ""engine"". Quite often, drummers and bass players are used to coordinating their playing, usually so that the bass and kick drum play the same pattern together, which sounds really nice and feels rewarding and motivating. But I'd say, not only the bassist and the drummer, but everybody should think about the whole, listen to other players and try to coordinate their playing. What's the guitar's rhythm - does it double one or more of the drum parts? What's the relationship between vocals and guitars? Is everybody playing and singing notes in the same register - does it work as one single big voice, or is it just big a mess? How about giving everybody their own space in the pitch spectrum? Is there a single common idea of the song's rhythm to begin with - does everybody agree if it's a 1/16th or 1/8th beat song? Etc. The more players you have, the more coordination is needed. :)"
"Why isn't D the ""most central"" note?","D's central position in Wicky-Hayden layout is an artifact of the fact that Dorian mode is a symmetric scale (its descending interval pattern and ascending interval pattern are the same) in some tunings, including the twelve tone equal temperament (and it's the only such diatonic mode). Even though I'm sure this mathematical property of Dorian mode has been exploited by some musicians, I'm not sure whether it has any real psycho-acoustic importance. Not all mathematical properties have psychological consequences. In this case, Western musical tradition does not seem to care about this symmetry as much as it cares about the fact that I-IV-V triads create a major (Ionian) scale (another mathematical property). Besides, this symmetry does not exist in just intonation (with its greater and lesser whole tones, between C-D and D-E respectively). It's a by-product of certain tunings."
Can anyone learn to sing higher?,Simple advice is to take singing lessons. We here cannot know what you're doing and what you're doing wrong just by reading. You have to have a professional coaching you how to use your body in another way than you do now.
How do harmonics work?,"Essentially all instruments produce overtones, which are frequencies other than the dominant frequency of the note.  When one or more overtones is a multiple of the base (or fundamental) frequency, it's called a harmonic.  Some instruments like drums do not generally have harmonic overtones.  Others like guitars, violins, and flutes do have have them; here's more info on Wikipedia. On a guitar, when you strike an open string the wavelength λ of the sound produced is double the length of the string.  When you play the twelfth fret, the wavelength is half of that (λ / 2), so the frequency is doubled.  The sound produced by the open string actually has that doubled frequency as a harmonic.  You can think of it as the string vibrating at both frequencies, as if you were somehow playing both the open string and the twelfth fret at the same time. In fact, a vibrating guitar string has components at many multiples of the base frequency (call it F).  To your ear it still sounds like the fundamental, but mathematically it's more like this: a*F + b*2F + c*3F + ... The higher-frequency elements give the note it's timbre; this is how you can tell two instruments apart, or even tell different kinds of guitar strings apart.  For example, the sound where a=1 b=0.6 c=0.3 will sound different than a=1 b=0.5 c=0.4.  Note that a is usually the largest coefficient, since F is the fundamental frequency.  If it wasn't it would sound like you were playing a different note, or multiple notes. Imagine a pure sine wave, x, with period T.  The note one octave higher is the sine wave y with period T/2.  If you add both together that's what you see with the harmonic effect.  The frequency of the resulting signal is 1/T with a clear sub-frequency of 2/T. 

 Note that the second half of the combined wave (x + y) is the inverse of the first half, just like any regular sine wave.  The period is still T, but the distinct crests make it ""feel"" like it has period T/2.  (Note again that normally y would have a smaller amplitude than x, since it is not the fundamental.) As for playing harmonics: When you hit the harmonic at the twelfth fret (for example), the string is still open so it's like you're playing the open string.  However, you're also creating a dead spot on the string, similar to fretting.  This deadens all of the frequency components that are incompatible with this dead spot, because their vibrations are interrupted.  The major frequency (F) does not have a dead spot at the twelfth fret, since its dead spots are at the ends of the string; therefore it does not sound.  2F has a dead spot there, obviously, so it is not deadened.  3F is deadened, since its dead spots are at 1/3 and 2/3 of the string length.  4F has a dead spot in the right place.  And so on. Thus the sound of the harmonic is essentially the following: b*2F + d*4F + f*6F + ... You'll note that if we set F2 = 2F, then we get this: a2*F2 + b2*F2 + c2*F2 ... This looks exactly the same as simply fretting the twelfth rather than playing the harmonic, right?  Not quite.  As Gauthier notes in the comments, the entire guitar string vibrates when you play a harmonic.  When you fret a note only the portion between the fret and the base of the string vibrates; when playing a harmonic, the portion between the fret and the head of the string vibrates as well.  This affects the coefficients (a, b, c, etc.) of the overtones, and gives harmonics their unique sound. On guitar and other string instruments, you can create a harmonic at any point on the string.  Harmonics are strongest where the string is divided into the smallest number of equal parts.  In other words, the harmonic at the 5th fret is weaker than the harmonic at the 7th fret, which is in turn weaker than the harmonic at the 12th fret.  This is because the 5th fret is 1/4 of the way along the string, dividing the string into 4 parts; the 7th is 1/3 of the way, dividing the string into 3; and the 12th is halfway, halving the string.  The harmonic at the first fret, for example, may not even be audible to your ear, because so many of the strongest frequencies are eliminated from the ""original"" sound of the open string."
"Is there a broader term for instruments, like the gong, whose volume briefly increases after being sounded instead of immediately decaying?","That's weird... apparently there's no English term for this exact phenomenon, but there is one in German: Einschwingvorgang (pronounced eyn-shving-fore-gung). Wikipedia wants to have it translated with transient, but I disagree. A literal translation would be “oscillation start process”, i.e. it describes the start of an oscillation which then just goes on, whereas a transient describes an event that's triggered at a discrete moment in time and also has only influence over a limited amount of time (like a piano note). [Ok, of course the gong is in fact triggered at a discrete moment and the tone doesn't last forever... but bear with me. In case of the gong, both einschwingung and transient apply!] “Slow attack” is how synthesizers may simulate einschwingung, but it's not really a good approach. An ADSR attack works by having the oscillator start immediately in full swing, but only gradually turning up its signal (envelope). This does work well to simulate transients, but not einschwingvorgangs, because in these is it the oscillator itself that only develops its vibration over time. Now, synthesizers also use the envelope technique to simulate decay, which is in physical instruments also a behaviour of the oscillator itself. Why then am I making a fuss about einschwingung being more than just attack? Einschwingung is physically related to “decay in reverse”, indeed it is often described this way – but IMO that's a bit misleading. Decay is (or at least, can be) a purely linear effect, for example a decaying piano string is for all practical purposes linear.  It is the linearity that guarantees the whole process can be simulated by a non-decaying oscillator followed by a time-dependent amplifier/filter, because for linear behaviour putting in a mixture of modes at the start is equivalent to putting in each individual mode and mixing the results★. But if einschwingung were linear (more precisely, LTI), the volume would either just keep on growing and growing until infinity, or reach a maximum amplitude and decaying back to zero before growing again, repeat... this is clearly not how instruments behave (though the former is a pretty good description of feedback in amplified audio). Instead, the einschwingung in gongs and also in bowed strings and many others is a fundamentally nonlinear effect. That means, you have energy transfer from some “quiet” mode into a more audible one. On a piano/guitar string this is not possible because it's too linear – it would be the equivalent of playing a 2nd harmonic on a guitar string and it then changing into a 3rd harmonic†. But that is essentially what happens in a gong: the beater initially just perturbs it in a very low-pitched mode that contains a lot of vibrational energy but is almost inaudible, but this energy is then transported into the much louder white-noise-ish modes. In bowed strings, it is the bow-hair–string contact that behaves nonlinearly. Specifically, increasing the sliding force 2× does not increase the sliding speed 2×. Instead, up to a point the string sticks completely to the rosin and then it's suddenly released. At the very start, the result of this isn't really an oscillation at all but more of a random/chaotic scrape – but then resonance kicks in and creates a phase-locked loop, which is what creates the actual violin tone. But the einschwingvorgang, or the transient that results from it, isn't really a tone at all and therefore can't be convincingly simulated with ADSR envelopes. It can only be simulated with nonlinear elements – the simplest of these are ring modulators and frequency modulation. The best known synth to use this approach is the DX-7. ★One way to see that a gong is non linear is to compare striking it a couple of times gently and each time waiting for the low-pitch mode to decay again, which striking it with the same intensity in quick tremolo. If the gong were linear, then the tremolo would just sound like each of the single strike in succession, but instead it will actually change its character and develop the swoosh that you also get from a harder hit, because the small hits accumulate until enough energy is in the system so it becomes nonlinear and feeds into the high-frequency modes. †Pianoteq actually has a feature that simulates this kind of behaviour – if you turn it on, your piano will suddenly sound like steel drums!"
Why do guitarists put tape on their amplifiers?,"If you look closely at the picture, you'll notice that pieces of tape are placed in very specific positions: one in the middle of speaker cone and the second one on the edge of speaker cone. Furthermore, look at where microphone is positioned - it directly aims the piece of tape. This technique is commonly used in recording - tape is used to mark microphone positions. That's because positioning microphone relative to speaker changes tone of sound that is recorded - placing microphone in the center gives brighter, more trebly sound whereas moving microphone to the edge of speaker gives warmer, more bassy sound. Once guitarist finds their ""sweet spot"", the easiest way to ""save"" it for future is to mark it using tape."
Why is note B marked with H in Scandinavia and Germany?,"According to the note ""H"" in German musical nomenclature The German nomenclature merely sought to give each pitch-class that ocurred in the system a unique name. Later, when the letter b was employed to effect mutation into other, more distant tetrachords (or hexachords), the German nomenclature was never modified to accomodate it, and its use as a flat sign was simply extended to the other 6 letters while retaining the H/B distinction for what everyone else calls B/Bb."
Do composers take advantage of the position of players in an orchestra for effect?,"Absolutely! Especially in the Classical period, where the 1st & 2nd violins were seated on opposite sides of the stage.  This allowed for antiphonal effects like this easily heard one in the coda of the 4th movement of Beethoven 7 (about 50 secs before the end):

The effect of the 1st & 2nd violins tossing the  motif back and forth would be audible in performances where the conductor uses antiphonal seating (1sts on the left, 2nds on the right).  I went back to an old Klemperer recording & found that yes, the 1sts very clearly come out left speaker & the 2nds out of the right.  You will also find it in the orchestral & chamber music of other composers in the Classical period as a matter of style.  Indeed, earlier musical periods also saw composers consciously use the placement of musicians for spatial effect: e.g. Gabrielli. And also in later periods composers were conscious of the spatial effect of performers, for example: In your specific example, i think the effect that was more in Brahms' mind was the registeral contrast between the upper & lower strings. I would suggest that the throwing of the motif between left & right is an artefact of this recording in that Bernstein is using the modern string seating (v1, v2, va, vc, db). Had the seating been antiphonal (v1, db, vc, va, v2), the stereo effect would be gone, but (perhaps) the registeral difference emphasised."
How necessary is a USB Audio Interface?,"""Worth the money"" is very subjective. Let's instead talk about the various factors you have to consider. Fitting A into B Good quality microphones usually have XLR connectors. These have three wires arranged so that any interference picked up in the cable is cancelled out. Many USB audio interfaces have XLR sockets (but check that the one you choose does). Your computer's microphone input will be a stereo 3.5mm socket. So if you don't buy a suitable audio interface, you have the issue of physically plugging stuff together.  You can get XLR to 3.5mm cables, such as this one.   These are not all that common, and I see anecdotes on the internet about many of them being incorrectly wired. However, it's potentially an $8 spend that would allow you to make-do without a USB interface. Power XLR doesn't only carry a sound signal. Condenser microphones need power, and usually the most convenient way to get power to the mic is phantom power, whereby a small current is carried on the signal lines of the cable. You can expect the XLR sockets on USB audio interfaces to provide phantom power -- but check the specifications before buying. Your PC's 3.5mm microphone socket won't provide phantom power. With many microphones, you can put in a battery instead - but it's an extra thing to worry about. Audio quality The input of the standard audio interface on a PC is not designed for connoisseurs. After all, most of them don't get used at all, and the rest get used for Skype-type chats. However, whether it's good enough for your needs is entirely subjective.  If you can record music from the line-in input to a quality you consider ""good enough"", then there's a chance the mic input will also be ""good enough"". The one extra step is the pre-amplifier in the PC which boosts the signal from mic level to line level - again, this may or may not be good enough for your needs. You'll always be able to find an audiophile who will insist you need more expensive equipment. If your built-in sound card does an acceptable job with line-level input, then one possible alternative to a USB audio interface, is to buy a microphone pre-amp:  Connecting it as: mic  (XLR)-> pre-amp (phone)-> PC line-in. This would effectively be replacing the low quality pre-amp in your PC with a high quality pre-amp. A good pre-amp like this costs about a third of the price of a USB interface, though, and handles only one mic. The USB interface will contain a broadly equivalent pre-amp for each input it has. Latency Latency is the delay between a sound wave hitting the microphone, and the digital audio stream reaching your computer program. If you're monitoring live, add on the delay between the program writing its output stream to the device, and it reaching your speakers. Non-music uses of a microphone don't need particularly low latency, so the designers of built-in inputs don't strive for low latency. However when you're layering tracks in a DAW, or listening to the computer's output as you play, it's very significant. Effects range from ragged timing on multitracked recordings, to complete befuddlement as you play! Better audio interfaces have lower latency in general. They generally also have drivers designed for lower latency. Often the driver configuration includes sliders to affect the buffer length. Larger buffers tolerate overloaded CPUs better, but lead to higher latency.  Control and convenience Your PC mic input is one socket. USB audio interfaces like the one you've been recommended, have a number of sockets, each of which your software sees as a separate input. With the right software you can even record from two inputs at the same time (e.g. two singers; a singer and a guitar; two mics, one for the instrument, one for room ambience). They also tend to have dedicated knobs, controls and displays. Some have built-in compression, to gracefully handle level clipping.  It's much more convenient to adjust input levels with a physical knob on the input device, than to fiddle with sliders in software. It's much more convenient to have a guitar and a mic both plugged in, than to have to unplug, plug in, adjust levels, each time you switch. The right microphone Different microphones are good for different purposes. Make sure you know what you want to use your microphone for, before spending money on it. What should I look for in a recording microphone for personal use?"
How can I safely extend my vocal range?,"If what you want is to improve your vocal range, I would recommend these exercises: Finally, remember to take into account your physical limitations. You might be able to widen up your vocal range a bit, but there's always going to be a limit. Good luck!"
Finger Exercises for Piano when not playing,"An exercise that I was taught, have seen many times, and also have used with others.  It can be done anywhere.  Instead of tapping my fingers, I do this exercise. Place your hand on the table (or whatever surface) as though you were resting your fingers on the keys.  ""Play"" the sequence 1-3-5-2-4, repeating it over and over.  Things to work on are your rhythm, make sure that each ""note"" you play is even.  (For instance, 1-3--2 are more dominant fingers, but make sure ---2-4 are doing their share of the work!)  Work on being able to keep that up for several minutes, keeping the 1-3-5-2-4 progression intact.  I find myself lapsing into 1-3-5-43-5-1 or something equally funky if I'm not careful. The temptation here is to do this with your dominant hand, but make sure you also do it with the other hand.  The tempo will be much (much, much, much...for me) slower, so spend more timing working with that hand.   This should also be done with both hands, keeping each note in sync.  For me, it usually ends in disaster. (:"
How many hours of practice total are typical for different piano grades?,"It depends on the grading system used.  I completed my grade 8 piano through the Royal Conservatory of Music, in Canada.  I would consider my general musical aptitude to be about average for a ""serious amateur"" musician, so keep that in mind. I practiced approximately two hours every day for a year (more towards the end than at the beginning), or around 750 hours total.  That got me a high 60s on the examination, I believe.  Definitely not super well, but enough to pass without being worried. So I think your range of 900-1200 hours would be accurate to do well on the grade 8 exam.  It also depends on your focus and your teacher.  I had a good teacher, but I focused a lot on theory (separate study time, separate exam that I took around the same time) and didn't work particularly hard on keeping my tempo consistent throughout songs (that was a big problem on my exam).  I also wasn't a great sight-reader. The only formal exams I took were grade 6 and grade 8, and I'd say 2 and 3 hours a day respectively are probably enough for the average player, based on my experience.  This is impossible to answer accurately for you, of course, but hopefully it gives you an idea. As for the total from grade 1 to grade 8: If you assumed starting at 30 min/day and linearly increasing until 3 hours/day, you'd get just over 5000 hours total.  So half of Gladwell's expected time.  I think this is reasonable, being ""half expert"" at grade 8 :P"
How to tell the time signature of a song by listening?,"Using only your ears, it's impossible to determine the exact time signature the composer would have used when writing the score. This is because there are many ways to write the same thing, all of which sound the same when played. For example, a piece written in 3/4 time can easily be re-written in 3/8 time by halving all the note values and playing it half as fast. The listener has no way of telling which you chose. The real trick is to determine the pulse of the song, which you do by feeling the rhythm of the music and identifying how often beat 1 happens. It's then up to you to choose a time signature that makes sense to you and the musicians around you!"
Why do people with perfect pitch perceive tunes not in 440 Hz out of tune?,"As someone with absolute pitch and trained in A440 12-tone equal temperament (i.e. the usual) with plenty of vocal music as a backup, I perceive notes that are several cents out of tune as ""off"" because I am not used to them. I have difficulty listening to music containing those out-of-tune notes unless the music is atonal. (Granted, I don't like listening to atonal music for the most part, probably because of my absolute pitch, but I did find out that I didn't think of quarter-tones as unpleasant in an atonal piece of music I listened to once.) My experience with this: as long everything is in the correct relation to each other why should it sound out of tune? If I find that the out-of-tune notes are in tune with each other, I figure that the music or instrument is out-of-tune and may be able to accept the music more. (I'm interested in hearing what B quarter sharp major sounds like, for example, but not in the context of a C major piece.) If I find that only some notes are out of tune, I figure that the performance is off-key or the instrument was not tuned properly. I'll have to note that I will not detect music as out-of-tune if it's not several cents off (unless the in-tune note is played at the same time--in that case, everyone can hear the beats that get produced). This probably does make listening to vocal music easier, as people probably go for Pythagorean tuning instead of 12-tone equal temperament within a specific key because Pythagorean tuning uses perfect ratios (e.g. 3:2 for perfect fifths) and 12-tone equal temperament doesn't unless they're octaves. As for why blatantly non-A440-12-tone-equal-temperament pieces sound wrong to me, I believe this is because of my musical training. A432 sounds slightly off to me, but I suspect that if I were trained in A432, it would be A440 that sounds off instead. To use your colour analogy, the monitor with the not-perfectly-RGB pixels is just like the out-of-tune musical instrument--the colours look different, the web-safe colours don't display properly, and this time, everyone notices. The extreme example is the dead pixel where one of them is black instead of RGB--people start throwing out their monitors or getting them repaired at this point. (You are right--""people define, very accurately on a physical level, what a standard red, green and blue are""!) (Caveat: I developed absolute pitch starting in Grade 8 (age 13)--I started with middle C as a reference, needing to use classical music for key references, and writing sorely thin transcriptions by ear. I've read before that absolute pitch developed this way may not be true absolute pitch, and needs constant maintenance or else it will be forgotten. On the other hand, I can instantly recognize soloing on the dominant of minor keys (an unorthodox mode), can recognize modes increasingly well, and can figure out when polytonality (2 or more keys being used at the same time) occurs...)"
Pay-to-Play Gigs,"Musician's representatives, including the Musician's Union in the UK are diametrically opposed to the entire concept of pay to play. As they point out, somebody is making money from these gigs, and it is wrong for the performers themselves not to make money from them. The Musician's Union Fair Play Guide says that co-promotion deals can work: The MU’s stance in relation to what constitutes an unfair or bad co-promotion deal is: 
  An arrangement whereby artists agree to play a part in the promotion or financing of a gig, but aren’t appropriately or proportionately rewarded for their efforts. That paper also discusses some of the benefits of schemes such as Get Me On Stage, which may provide opportunities a band may not otherwise see. Personally, I feel Pay to Play devalues the effort musicians put in. I'd always want to walk away from any venue that demands this, and encourage other bands to do the same. I may cut our asking price for a particular venue or gig, depending on a number of factors, but keeping your baseline fee is valuable."
How do you determine if you're ready to join a band?,"Is there a particular set of skills that you'd say is required before one considers joining a band?  Not really. Look for other players at about your own skill level. If you are taking classes, perhaps your teacher can advise you of others looking to play together. If you are reasonably comfortable playing in front of others, you should do reasonably well. I don't consider myself a beginner, but due to an abusive ex, I don't play in front of others. Older students tend to be far more critical of their own abilities, so the ""tell me I suck"" concern is something a teenager won't have. I am quite comfortable standing in front of a group of strangers and giving a presentation/speech (I've even run for elected office), but put an instrument in my hands in front of even close friends and I choke.   Is being able to compose new melodies important, or is it possible for a new player to get by for a while with someone else working out the arrangements? This totally depends on the group. I've seen some bands that played in bars who had players of widely different skill levels together in the same band. One could tell the guitarists who were classically trained, as their skills were a lot higher than others. In some of the groups, most of the music was written by one of the players. For an example, look at the early Indigo Girls albums, compare and contrast the songs written by Emily (complex and deep meaning) vs Amy (simple).  Finally, if you are looking to play in bands, you may want to pursue bass (guitar) as those players are a lot less common. Bassists are far more rare and hard to come by. "
"Why are there many guitarists, but only one drummer in a band?","This is not always true. While most bar bands have this set up, if you go to many large concerts (for instance the Eagles concert tour), you will often find many percussionists working simultaneously.  But on average, and for most typical bands, I'd say you're correct. And while I can't give a scientific reason, I can give my general opinions and at no charge. But to sum my opinions up, I think it has mostly to do with an issue of competing within the same musical space. Edit
I have to add a link nicely provided by Bradd Szonye that lists bands that use double drummers, that is two drummers playing their own full kits: Double Drumming Band List.  Thank you Bradd!"
How often is it recommended to change bass strings?,"I change my strings when they start to sound stale, about every 4-6 months.  As a gauge, I play about 5 hours a week in my church, plus an additional hour or two of practice on top of that.  When I used DR coated strings, they would last a bit longer than that, but even with the extra life I had a hard time justifying the extra cost."
Arthritis In Hands (Playing With Pain In Hands) - Are There Recommended Approaches?,"Sorry to hear that your playing is impacted. I don't have R.A., but I have a number of wrist, shoulder, and arm problems. Here are some things that I have found useful for my situation - I hope they can help you with yours:"
Why is the key included in classical music titles?,"Many classical composers frequently used this method that you stated. Bach wrote over 1120 pieces. Naming 1120 pieces, each with a unique name can be hard. Some were named for where they were performed e.g. the Brandenburg Concertos. It was also common for a composer to number his pieces of the same format. Eine Kleine Nachtmusik is also known as Serenade No. 13 for strings in G Major. The most common  technique, however, was to name after the musical form and its key. Beethoven composed a Bagatelle in C minor. He then titled this piece Bagatelle in C minor. His well known Fur Elise is also referred to as Bagatelle No. 25 in A minor.  Using a key did not prohibit a composer from using that key again (there are only thirty keys). Using a key did not prohibit them from using the same key on a work with the same form either. Bach wrote over thirty Prelude and Fugues. Four of these were Prelude and Fugue in A minor. They are now differentiated by their own BWV catalog numbers (assigned in 1950). Many pieces did have unique titles, but with the amounts of pieces the composers composed, unique titles were difficult to come up with. Also, most pieces had no lyrics. It is much easier to come up with a title when there are lyrics. So, they turned to this technique. It was used frequently during the Common Practice Period.  Opus numbers are also used to number pieces. They only number published pieces though. Not all pieces a composer wrote would be published. Some works published posthumously are also given Opus numbers. Opus numbers are different from the catalogue numbers I mentioned before. Some composers have multiple catalogues of their works which can be confusing."
How do classical composers write music?,"Why the past tense? How do classical (or rather, orchestral) composers write music? How does any composer write music for instruments they don't themselves play? Although a composer doesn't necessarily need to be able to play an instrument to a high standard, they do need to understand the mechanics of the instrument, its limitations and capabilities. This isn't really a matter of genius, just of study and knowledge. It's certainly not ""intuitive"" - it's learned. Composers tend to collaborate with musicians and make changes based on their input. So, for example, they might give a score to a soloist, have them spend some time with it, then come back with feedback - ""this part is impossible to play, how about we change it like this.""  Nowadays composers can, if they wish, try multi-instrument arrangements out on a sequencer. It's still useful to be able to imagine how an arrangement would sound, and of course in the past that was the only way. The archetypal composer sits at their piano; a very useful tool for trying out harmonies etc.   It would also make a great deal of sense to write mini-arrangements before expanding them to full orchestral arrangements. For example, score a segment of your symphony for a string quartet, and have a string quartet play it for you, as a prototype for the final work."
Using keyboard/MIDI controller to learn piano,"Let's be very precise about what we're talking about: A MIDI controller is anything that can send MIDI commands to another MIDI device. Keyboard type MIDI controllers are only one kind. But, for the purposes of this answer, let's assume that whenever we say ""MIDI controller"" we mean the piano keyboard type. A MIDI sound module is a device which accepts MIDI commands, and produces a sound. Those sounds could be artificial sounding beeps, realistic sounding simulations of a real instrument, or drums. Let's forget about the other types of sounds, and assume you're interested only in piano sounds. What you refer to as a ""keyboard"", I will call a digital piano. It's the MIDI controller, and the MIDI sound module, all in one unit. (It's possible that internally, it's not using MIDI, but that's a detail that's not important). It's common for these to also have MIDI connections, so you can use them standalone, or as a controller, or as a sound module. MIDI commands can be carried over traditional 5-pin MIDI cables, but nowadays they can also be carried over USB. This is important, because it means that a PC or a Mac -- or even an iPad/tablet/phone -- can become a MIDI sound module. For example, Macs come with GarageBand, which has perfectly acceptable piano sounds that you can play with MIDI. MIDI controllers often have some PC/Mac software bundled. So: The reason I stress you should think of a digital piano as a sound module and a controller in the same box, is that everything I am about to say about controllers, applies equally whether it is part of a digital piano or separate. The very simplest controllers are just a row of on/off switches. You hold down a key, and a note plays. You release it, the note stops. You have no control over the loudness of the note. This is OK if you want to sound like early Kraftwerk; it's bad if you want to sound like a pianist. More sophisticated controllers are velocity sensitive -- the harder (or actually, faster) you hit the key, the louder the note, just like a real piano. To have anything like the control a pianist has, you need velocity sensitivity. There is also a feature called aftertouch. This lets you change the pressure on the key after the initial strike, to affect the sound. This is not something a real piano has, so if you are only interested in piano sounds, ignore aftertouch. High end controllers have weighted keys. This is weight in the construction of they key, so it most closely simulates the feel of a real piano keyboard. Cheaper keyboards either abandon all effort to feel like a piano keyboard, or simulate weight using springs. I think any ambitious learner needs a wide enough keyboard to play two-handed parts, and I think 61 keys is a minimum for that. 88 keys is the width of a real piano keyboard. With 61 keys, you will encounter pieces where you run out of notes and have to compromise somehow. Some controllers have smaller keys. You want full-size keys. My own choice: I have a 61 key USB/MIDI keyboard that is ""semi-weighted"". I think this is a good compromise between cost and realism (I previously played on my family's poorly maintained upright piano). You will notice a difference in feel between this and the piano you are using. The difference probably doesn't matter too much at first. In any case, you will want to learn to be able to play on different pianos. Real pianos vary in feel too."
What is the best way of learning the notes on the fretboard.,"Begin by learning the open strings. Then picture the relation of each string to the next string (ie ""-5"" frets and ""-4"" between G and B). Picture an octave on two adjacent strings (""+7"" frets or ""+8"" between G and B), and then on two strings a string apart (ie ""+2"" frets ""+1"" string except, you guessed it, where G and B are involved). Then learn fret 9 or fret 3 on every string, and from time to time stop your practice and try to name what you were playing or about to play. Once you feel at least a little bit comfortable, there's a Satriani exercise which has helped me a great deal : take a metronome, pick a (slow) tempo (slower than 60), then pick a note and on each beat, play it in a new position until you can't find a new location (you can include harmonics if you want). Then pick another note. You can cycle notes any way you like, but I recommend using something common, like the circle of fifths or fourths. Keep going at it regularly, without obsessing about it, and you'll be surprised."
"Does leaving a capo on ""hurt"" the strings?","I would certainly not leave the capo on my fretboard when not in use. I cannot say it visibly hurts the neck for sure but it does wear out the strings. Here is a wonderful piece of advice from Lee Griffith in his article, A Capo is a Wonderful Thing: One caution is important to mention. Do not leave the capo on the
  instrument when not playing it. The capo, when clamped on the neck,
  holds the strings down on the fretboard and creates extra tension
  on the neck and the top of the guitar. All acoustic guitars are
  destined, at some point in time, to have problems due to the
  tension of the strings. Why hasten the process by leaving a capo
  clamped on your guitar?"
Why are C♯ and D♭ different frequencies?,"The linked answer is a bit of a mess, and it's a common mess for people to make. When we talk about the exact frequencies of each pitch class, we have to know the temperament, and a reference pitch. For example, 12-tone equal temperament (12TET) with A4=440Hz is a standard in modern music. From those two parameters, we can extrapolate the exact frequency of every possible note. 12TET is nearly ubiquitous nowadays (at least in Western music), but it doesn't sound as clean as Just Intonation (JI). In essence, 12TET has made every key sound equally imperfect. JI creates a scale where the intervals in the primary chords are all very nice simple ratios, and so the chords ring out very cleanly, but it only works in that key. Important note: within a given JI tuning, each of the 12 pitch classes still has only one single frequency. There is no difference between C♯ and D♭ in, say, ""Pythagorean tuning based on A, with A=440Hz"". But most music doesn't stay in one key. While a piano can't make pitch adjustments on the fly (which is why we've agreed to use 12TET for it), most instruments in an orchestra can. So when the piece is in A major, the orchestra will use JI and adjust C♯ to be a little flatter than it would be if using 12TET. But then if the piece modulates to F♯ minor, they'll start playing it slightly sharp. When people say that C♯ is not the same as D♭, what they really mean (whether they realize it or not) is that context may make for different micro-adjustments. In C major, a C♯ might be the third of an A major chord, perhaps a secondary dominant of the ii chord, while D♭ might be the root of the Neapolitan chord. These would result in different tuning choices. (edited from comment suggestions, some comments are now orphaned)"
Why is dropped D tuning used so often?,It also makes it even easier to play power chords - you only need one finger with drop D!
Can people really sight-read advanced pieces?,"A skilled sight-reader surely can (except if the piece is really difficult). And they can do more, for example they can read the music and play it in a different key, or they can read a string quartet (that is, four independent staves with three different clefs simultaneously) and play most of the important things in it, and so on. Not every good pianist is a good sight-reader, though; the skills are quite separate from each other. I myself am able to play for example most of Grieg's lyric pieces prima vista - on first sight, and I can do some transposing on the fly, but I know similarly skilled pianists who are much better sight-readers than I am. Like every other skill, it's a matter of practicing. Some of the first things we were taught in our sight-reading class were: So, quite a bit of sight-reading actually boils down to knowing the keyboard and the building blocks of music very well, and being a good cheater :^)"
When is a piece in A minor versus C major?,"The last chord harmony of most pieces give a feeling of ending. (It would, wouldn't it - otherwise the piece goes on, potentially).With no key signature, shown, a piece could be in C major or A minor. This last chord gives a big clue as to which key the writer thinks it's in. The presence of G#, showing usually a V-I cadence is also a good clue, except that it is used in C major, to modulate to the relative minor. Maybe if it happens a lot, there is more chance of the tune actually being in A minor. Trouble is, that G# may show melodic or harmonic minor tendency, but wouldn't be there if the tune is written using A natural minor notes. Another pointer is where the tune tends to gravitate to, especially at cadence points. If it feels like it's coming to rest on more Cs, or more As, there's the answer. A nice example of this dilemma is 'Fly Me To The Moon'. Starts on Am, but ends on C.  Bottom line is probably - 'Does it really matter?'"
Will a 61-key keyboard severely restrict my piano repertoire?,"Most keyboard instruments of the baroque Era as well as early pianoforte had fewer keys than the current 88-standard (some modern piano like the Bosendorfer Imperial have 97 keys, 9 additional keys in the bass), and much of Bach keyboard works for instance can be played on such a restricted keyboard. With restricted high notes you will have difficulties with many of Chopin's and Liszt's works where the composers take hold of the whole instrument and use replication of elements among successive octaves for effect. Many pieces of composers such as Scriabin and Debussy also use the whole range of the piano. Another thing you would miss is playing four-hands, but I guess this is not the kind of activity you are into. If your new keyboard is able to transpose 1 octave up or down, you may be able to play more pieces by adjusting the range to the work you want to play, as if you were shifting your chair left or right in front of your piano."
"What is the difference between a ""riff"" and a ""melody""?","I think you could look this from multiple points of view; many riffs do contain melodic motifs; however they are also in a lot of cases very rhythmic.   So given a sliding scale with rhythm at one end and melody on the other, you could place different riffs in different places on the scale. Looking at genres of music such as the more extreme areas of metal, there are riffs that are very melodic and complex, but because of the cutting nature of them and the way the are muted and picked, sound very rhythmic.  That being the case I would 'hypothesize' that one large difference between a melody and a riff in a lot of cases, is a rhythmic aspect found in the riff. You can definitely construct a song around a riff; bands have been doing it since the early days; check out Rolling Stones songs like 'Satisfaction' and Jumping Jack Flash.  The entire genre and many sub-genres of hard rock and metal are hugely riff based."
"What is the difference between a ""band"" and an ""orchestra""","Small ensembles in the pop and folk idiom can all go by the term of band; this answer will focus on what are referred to as ""large ensembles."" In the jazz context, the name of orchestra was historically applied in order to give credence to groups that would otherwise have been marginalized by the cultural mainstream and racism. That term has now been accepted in the jazz tradition. It's possible that ""band"" originally referred to the military groups that jazz ensemble playing grew out of, and ""orchestra"" was seen to apply to a higher standard of musicianship. Outside of the jazz context, there are a few more rules that apply: Orchestra generally refers to any ensemble with sections of bowed string instruments. This can be further broken down into String Orchestra to include only the stringed instruments, and Symphony Orchestra incorporating winds and percussion. Band, outside the idiom of folk and pop music, generally refers to an ensemble of wind instruments plus percussion section, with or without a string bass. Brass Bands are mostly popular in Europe, and contain the above without woodwind instruments. For those ensembles that include woodwinds, there exist other terms of questionable interchangeability: Concert Band and Symphonic Band are generally used in school music programs with too many musicians for a single ensemble (Typically, the Symphonic Band is held to a higher level of performance than the Concert Band). Additionally, Wind Ensemble is usually held to the highest level of performance, and in most cases contain only one player per part. To attempt to draw some questionable generalization from this, I might say that the distinction between Band and Ensemble is that of number of players per part. This holds true to jazz in many educational situations: in a music program with more than one jazz group, the Jazz Band might have many musicians per part, while the Jazz Ensemble would be the auditioned, one-on-a-part ensemble. In the orchestral situation, string instruments are always many-on-a-part for purposes of volume, and orchestral wind sections are almost always one-on-a-part. Of course, all of this is just an attempt to generalize tradition. Really, the only answer to your question is ""because that's what they call themselves."" Just to briefly elaborate on the term Jazz Orchestra... Nowadays this term is interchangeable with Big Band, the instrumentation of which is fairly standardized: Common variations include vibes, auxiliary percussionist, and/or extra trumpet player. Soloists (traditionally 1st tenor sax, 2nd trombone, and 4th trumpet) are generally seated closest to the rhythm section. Section leaders sit next to them (thus they are all stacked and can hear each other clearly), and remaining parts are sequential down the line, allowing the bass voices (bari sax, 4th trombone, and upright bass) to border the band."
"Beginning ""adult"" piano for musicians","Alfred Publishing has the ""Basic Adult Piano Course."" I'm not a trained pianist, technically, but my keyboard methods course during undergrad used this series. Use Amazon's peek inside feature to get an idea for what might be most appropriate for your level. There's also the ""All-in-One Course,"" but that includes extra theory instruction that you might not need. Sight reading a 4-part chorale is certainly a good goal, but you're only going to get there with consistent diligent practice. You can find tons of Bach chorales on IMSLP. I'd go get some and work on them alongside lesson book practice from the beginning—that will get you to your goal faster. Since you're not using a teacher, I'm going to give you just a few little tips: You'll gain more hand independence and bass clef skills just as a result of going through the lesson book, but if you really want to drill bass clef, there are some handy tools at http://musictheory.net. Here's an example bass clef exercise. If you want to input notes with a MIDI-USB keyboard, you'll need some other software. Most are very expensive, but if you're a Mac user, you can download and use the free Aquallegro."
Why is it that I can sometimes guess the next note?,"First off, for any melody that stays within a key, you have about a 1/7 chance of any random note you guess being the next note. Second, there are popular melody patterns and techniques, and sometimes the chords being played will suggest likely places for the melody to go. Depending on the chords and the harmony, you may be instinctively understanding that a chord tone is likely, and that brings the probability of a randomly guessed chord tone being right down to 1/3 or 1/4. This is one way that it's possible for people with no knowledge of music theory to make up their own melodies to hum that sound ""good"" (at least to them). They are basically guessing what the next note could/should be based on their tonal memory of music that they like and the popular melodic patterns and elements used in that music."
What does it mean when two notes are stuck together?,"Noteheads take up one full space on a staff. (The corollary to this is that noteheads placed on a line take up half of the space on either side of the line.) When notes are at least a third apart (as in the first measure of the example below), there is plenty of space for two noteheads of standard size to fit on top of each other.  But when notes are less than a third apart (as in the second measure of the above example), there's not enough space to notate the pitches directly on top of each other; doing so just confuses the notation. So we settle on the solution shown in the final measure, where the noteheads are offset slightly. But in all cases, this notation indicates that the given pitches occur at the same time. Lastly, accidentals only apply to the staff line or staff space on which they are placed. Since the ♯ here is on the second staff line from the bottom (G, assuming this is treble clef), it only applies to that G, not to the F. If the composer wanted an F♯ in addition to the G♯, s/he would have indicated a second ♯ in the score."
How is this B flat guitar chord physically possible?,"I use this kind of ""A-shape"" barre chord all the time, although I must admit I rarely teach it to students. I actually find it easier than using fingers 2, 3 and 4 to play the three fret 3 notes. All you have to do is bend your third L.H. finger backwards, so that the joint nearest the knuckle moves forwards and away from string 1. Here's a picture of me using this technique: "
Why do some artists tune their guitars half a step or whole step down?,Lots of reasons; the most prevalent reason is probably so that they can keep the tune within the range of their voice.  Jimi Hendrix was famous for this; tuned a half step down.  Other reasons; to create a different atmosphere in the music; as in the case of Metal where instruments are down-tuned to create the darkest most aggressive sounding riffs possible.
Why is the saxophone not common in classical repertoire?,"This question has been asked many times and various reason have been proposed: The saxophone is too loud or doesn't blend There are numerous recordings proving that the saxophone in the hands of a good player can play extremely quietly and blend anywhere. There was a cartel of French instrument makers who wanted to protect their market and hindered the introduction of the saxophone. This might have been true in France during Adolphe Sax's lifetime, but it doesn't explain why the saxophone didn't make its way into the orchestra later, or in other countries. Plus this boycott didn't stop the instrument finding its way into wind orchestras. The saxophone had a reputation as a 'comedy' instrument. This reputation  didn't develop until the early 20th century in North America with ensembles like the ""Six Brown Brothers"". I think the main reason is much more simple. The saxophone was  fifty years too late. The symphony orchestra in its present form was complete by 1800. The fact that this combination still exists today, almost unchanged, shows how perfect it had become. There was no musical or acoustical reason to introduce a new instrument. "
"How should one practice a piece that is learned, but not fully mastered?","I suspect that if you keep making random mistakes with a specific piece and you are not generally out of shape (as in, ""I have been playing three hours a month for the past six months"") you probably did an half-assed job at learning the piece in the first place. What works for me in these situations is  Of course, all the above implies a consistent practice regime."
"The differences between natural, harmonic and melodic minors","There are at least some differences in how they're used: Natural minor is a kind of default. In the common practice era a dominant chord usually contains the leading note, which is a semitone below the tonic, because that note has a strong tendency to resolve to the tonic. So, from the harmony point of view, the 7th degree of the natural minor scale should be raised in these cases, and you get the harmonic minor scale. Using a ""flat"" leading note makes the music sound modal, and was used both before and after the common practice era (probably also during it in folk music and such). Raising only the 7th degree causes the scale to have an augmented second between the 6th and 7th degrees. This is a difficult interval to sing and also sounds like a jump, unlike the other intervals in the scale. So, from the melodic point of view, if you need the raised 7th and want to go up melodically, you also raise the 6th degree to make things more fluid. Since the raised 7th degree is a leading note you usually go melodically upwards when using it. If you're going downwards you're probably not in a dominant harmony and thus you use the natural minor. Another reason for using the natural minor when going downwards is that if you take the upwards melodic minor and play that downwards it'll only start sounding like a minor after the fifth note or so. In short, you start with the natural minor scale. You use the harmonic minor scale when you need a dominant chord, and modify it to be the melodic minor if you need the leading note in the melody. This all is, of course, simplified but should give the basic idea."
"I'm learning music theory, but none of the songs I'm trying it on are playing by the rules","As ggcg said, those rules are mainly the rules of western common-practice harmony, i.e. the harmony that was used in baroque, classical and early romantic music. It has, for sure, also had a lot of influence on pop music, but it also has a lot of differences. A crucial one is what I would sum up with the following statement, which may sound a bit crazy: Classical music has no chords. That is, chords in the sense of lead-sheet chords, where the composition basically specifies which pitch-classes you're allowed to use at any given time†, but doesn't really specify any particular voicing. Instead, classical music is all about voices. Each voice has a melodic role by itself, and many of the common-practice “harmony” rules are actually rather corollaries of melodic rules applying to the single voices. This aspect just doesn't make sense for most rock/pop music, because the harmonies aren't usually layed out in a melodic way at all, instead you typically have some chord which is strummed or arpeggiated in some rhythmic pattern‡, then a switch to another chord with a similar pattern but no clear connection which notes in the former chord lead on to a particular note in the next one. Thus a large number of the classical rules don't apply. In particular, the rule that a dominant should resolve to the tonic (or its relative) is most of all a rule about the leading tones in the dominant. These are notes that, if you think about them melodically, strongly “demand” making a particular step. The ⅶ note (third of the Ⅴ7) strongly wants to go upwards a step, whereas the ⅳ note (seventh of the Ⅴ7) wants to go down. Well, if you fulfill that, there's only so much harmonies you can end up on. But when you don't even consider the notes in the chords as belonging to individual voices that would need to be continued, then this whole issue doesn't arise. In that light it's not that remarkable to find Ⅴ-Ⅳ in a song like Knocking on Heaven's Door. Voice leading still is relevant for lines that actually are treated as melodies. In rock/pop this is usually most of the time a single voice, which has much more freedom; not much rules to be found here (they aren't needed because the soloist can just improvise whatever they feel fitting; this gives a nice lot of expressive freedom). It is often at least one part of the chord progression too, though, Knocking on Heaven's Door happens to a strong example: the guitar has quite prominently the notes G-F♯-E on top, which in many version is also doubled by choir or a lead instrument: Common-practice would have you think that the F♯ should lead rigorously upwards, but here it doesn't. Why not? Well, it certainly helps that the D is not played as a dominant-seventh chord but just as a major chord, which doesn't include the tritone between F♯ and C (the dissonance which is to quite some part responsible for the resolution-demand). Then again, you regularly find Ⅴ7-Ⅳ7 in blues, so that doesn't seem to be the make-or-break either (rather, this song's very simplistic folkyness just eschews all chords that aren't simple triads). Rather, I would suggest that it has most to do with the intended mood/expression. Common-practice music is very “forward-idealistic” – in baroque it's the drive towards perfection and god (or, for a more down-to-earth explanation, pleasing the absolute king), in classical and romantic music the yearning for some goal that may be reachable (major-resolution-happy-nice) or not (desparate buildup towards the inevitable disaster). Not so blues and descended genres: here resignation is a main theme. On the risk of over-interpreting, one might say it's the subversion of European ideas into a failed version of the American Dream: “there is a clear path upwards, but we don't get to actually take it”. Knocking on Heaven's Door is not bluesy, but it too very strongly expresses such a resignation mood. And that's just one example of a wider theme, which is perhaps the best reason why you should care about theory: theory tells you what mood you will cause when using such and such progressions. What effect you want is your own decision, but if you know what then a firm grasp on theory makes it much easier to figure out how to actually achieve it. †I'm sure somebody will remark at this spot “but what about figured bass?” Isn't figured bass essentially the same thing as a lead sheet? — Indeed it kind of is, however unlike with pop lead sheets a baroque continuo player is expected to actually infer the intended voicing, not just the pitch classes it contains. ‡Classical music also has “chord arpeggiation patterns”, such as Alberti bass. But they're not really the default, more of an extra embellishment (and relying too much on such devices would be considered somewhat lazy)."
Understanding minor key harmony,"This is an excellent and important question. In a minor key, all 4 possible combinations of 6th and 7th scale degree are used, and each combination corresponds to a scale: All chords from these three scales can be and are used in compositions in a minor key. They can (and again are) rather freely mixed by composers in one and the same piece. It is a big misunderstanding by beginners that pieces are written 'in melodic minor' or in 'harmonic minor'. Usually a piece is just in minor and all combinations of 6th and 7th scale degrees are used harmonically and melodically.  The truth of my quote ""the 6th and the 7th scale degrees can be modified whenever the composer feels it's necessary to do so"" was doubted in another answer. However, it is almost a tautology because there are no rules and if there were any, composers would (and should) not care about them. Of course, certain combinations occur more often than others, but all are allowed and all are used, no matter if you analyze Bach or modern jazz pieces. As for modes, in a purely modal piece (e.g. in dorian) you are not as free as in a general minor key. But this is the composer's choice because he/she decided to write a modal piece. However, all other notes can always be used as passing notes or approach notes. Here it's mainly the rhythmic placement that determines whether a passing or approach note sounds good. The notes of the mode are usually placed on stressed beats, whereas all others are usually placed on unstressed beats. EDIT: Inspired by a comment (see below) I'd like to give one famous example of the fact that in a minor key the major 6th, major 7th, minor 6th and minor 7th can appear in any possible combination, and that composers usually don't care much about academic guidelines (like using major 6th and major 7th ascending, and using minor 6th and minor 7th only descending, etc.). The following example is by J.S. Bach. Note the descending sequence of root, major 7th, major 6th and fifth in the last bar. And we're not even talking about 20th or 21st century music yet!

Can one tell by ear whether a bowed instrument is being played up or down?,"It's easiest for the player to put downward pressure on the instrument string  when the bow is making contact with the string near the end that the player holds (the 'frog' end). This means that on a downstroke (extending the arm), it's easier to start the bowing action with firmer pressure.  Players tend to take advantage of this by using downstrokes to play strong beats, and upstrokes to play weak beats. Obviously it may not be possible to maintain this rule strictly, depending on the rhythm of the passage being played; if not, players will have to compensate by applying more pressure on the upstrokes.  Another consideration is that if a section indicates repeated strokes in the same direction, the bow will have to be lifted between each stroke, leading to shorter strokes even if rests aren't indicated between the notes. In theory it's also possible that the direction of the horsehair makes a difference - but although some think so, Others don't (1) (2), so it's possible that bows aren't always re-haired in the same direction anyway. If there is any effect, it's likely to be very small as the scales on the hair are very tiny (p28). To your question, then : Can one tell by ear ? The answer is probably that it depends how skilled at compensating for pressure differences between down and up strokes the player is, and of course whether or not they are actually trying to compensate. In most situations though, a player would use the natural difference between an up and downstroke to their advantage, rather than try to fight against it."
How do jazz players communicate while playing?,"Collective improvisation doesn't mean ""everyone plays at the same time"". Playing jazz is as much about listening as it is being able to play your instrument. In that kind of situation, a player isn't thinking about ""what should I play next"", but rather ""what is the music, at this moment in time, missing that I can provide?"" Cacophony is more likely to happen with less experienced players who haven't fully grasped this concept, and need to be reminded that not playing is equally valid as playing in one of these sections (particularly in big bands with a lot of players!). The vast majority of communication that does occur is musical, and even when playing notated music, happens in the spaces around the notation. In a traditional big band, the entire rhythm section is usually given a lot of freedom, and is typically very good at this. The piano and bass will be listening to each other for harmonic material, and the drums obviously have immense influence over the rhythmic groove. It is very common for the drums to respond to rhythmic figures improvised by one of the other instruments. When a soloist is improvising, they are included into this feedback loop, and the most exciting soloists you see will have a constant line of communication open to the rhythm section. You should be able to hear them respond to each other when one of them improvises a lick or rhythm that stands out. There is some nominal visual communication that occurs in this context, usually to direct traffic during solo sections. One thing you will probably start seeing everywhere now that I've mentioned it is when a soloist is playing his last chorus, he'll give a look to the bandleader or next soloist to indicate that he's about to be finished. Sometimes solo lengths are predetermined, and sometimes the music the soloist is playing is so strongly formulated that the ending chorus is completely obvious to everyone based entirely on the content. Again, with less experienced ensembles, a bandleader with a more active role will usually direct traffic more obviously; pointing to the next soloist a few bars before the next chorus where they should come in."
When to use a dot or a tie in music notation?,"Yep, the second one is far better for precisely the reason you say. A general rule is that you shouldn't have dotted-notes that start on an off beat and carry through the next beat. There are exceptions even to this rule, but showing the underlying beat structure of the meter is paramount in the vast majority of situations.  Elliott Carter is an example of a composer that often violates this notational rule (sometimes using four beamed dotted notes, occasionally even crossing the barline), but this is for the specific purpose of notating multiple simultaneous tempos. Even with that reason, an argument could be made that it isn't worth it due to the difficulty with reading it. "
Do musicians count the meter all the time?,"Counting is an absolutely necessary step when learning a new piece.It is the rhythmic framework of any piece. Without it, you may well be playing a different tune. 'All the right notes, but not in the right timing'. You ask 'do they count all the time?' Well there's no need once a piece is well known to the player. We sound out words as kids, but eventually we learn to recognise the shapes of bigger words, and reading dots is similar. The rhythm pattern of a set of dots becomes known, not in every case, but patterns emerge and are remembered. We don't count the dots on a die - we recognise their pattern.  Playing with pros, looking at a new tune, often I'll hear 'Heads down and count like Hell !' muttered. Makes good sense. After all, how else is a tune going to be played successfully first time if the rhythm is ragged? Yes, there are tricky rhythmic patterns that have to be played, and it depends how good at playing/reading someone is, but a basic, simple answer to your question is a resounding OF COURSE !! But - the header question is different - there's no need to do that once you're inside the piece. An internal clock takes over (or should !) Either foot tapping, head nodding, shoulder shrugging, whatever, it ought to be making the player into a human metronome. Some can stay still, and do it mentally, but most good players will have some form of keeping time bodily."
What is the relationship between the melody line and the rhythm chords?,"There isn't one definitive answer to this question besides ""Try to be Paul McCartney.""  That said, here are some guidelines that I hope prove helpful: Don't just use chord tones (meaning, notes that are in the chord you're playing at the moment) and don't just use non-chord tones.  Non-chord tones will give your melody a sense of momentum and tension, while chord tones will give your melody a sense of stability and release.  Of the chord tones, roots and fifths have the most stability, while thirds and sevenths strike a nice balance.  Too much of either is no good: too much tension and momentum, and you run the risk of your melody running out of control, which ultimately feels chaotic.  Too much stability, and your melody will sound dull and boring. This basically means that your melody shouldn't jump around too much---a few big intervals are fine and can be really dramatic, but most of the time, your melody should stick to stringing together notes that are near each other.  Otherwise it's hard for the listener's ear to keep up. For example, say you're playing the A-D-E chord progression you mentioned.  C# is the third of the A chord, and D is the root of the D chord (obviously).  So a melody that plays the C# and then the D is employing voice leading. So you have the opposite challenge: to pick chords to fit a melody.  As before, there's no one right way to go about this, but again, here are some guidelines: ""Eleanor Rigby""---""Rig"" and ""by"" are both chord tones, and the melody lands on ""by"" like a rock.  That note is the root of the chord, and it provides a lot of stability for the melody, which is good because the next line is... ""Picks up the rice in a church where a wedding has been""---""Rice"" and ""church"" aren't chord tones, and they have a lot of momentum.  This line is almost like a roller coaster: ""Picks up the"" is the initial ascent, followed by a briefly held point of tension on ""rice"", then a quick fall, a quick rise, and then another briefly held point of tension on ""church"", another fall, etc.  It ends on ""been"", which is a chord tone for the next chord (the IV chord).  Stability and release after the tension and drama of the roller coaster.  Paul knew what he was doing. I could go on, but it would take a long time, and this the main idea.  Good luck, and enjoy the adventure of composition!"
The notes outside the major scale form a pentatonic scale,"It is known, maybe especially to piano/keyboard players, that the black keys form the Gb major / Eb minor pentatonic scale. Given the structure of the major scale and the structure of the pentatonic scale it's of course no coincidence, but I don't think there's some deeper meaning to it; it's just a result of these structures. The interesting question (in my opinion) is if there's a ""musical way"" to make use of this fact. The answer is yes, there is. Many jazz musicians know that the minor pentatonic scale a minor third higher than the root of a dominant seventh chord (or the major pentatonic scale a tritone away from the root of a dominant seventh chord) contains all possible alterations and the minor seventh of that dominant seventh chord. So, e.g., over a C7 chord the Eb minor / Gb major pentatonic scale contains Eb -> #9
 Gb -> b5 / #11
 Ab -> b13
 Bb -> 7
 Db -> b9
 So you can use that pentatonic scale over C7 to create altered or outside sounds. As an example, if you play over a II-V-I in C major (Dm7 - G7 - Cmaj7), you can play a different pentatonic scale over each chord. One way to do that is to move up chromatically, which gives you an altered sound over the V chord (G7): Dm7:   A minor pent. (Dm9 sound)
 G7:    Bb minor pent. (altered)
 Cmaj7: B minor pent. (lydian)
 Of course, this trick for playing outside can also be used over other chords, such as minor 7 chords. Check out this example of Chick Corea using a G minor pentatonic scale to step outside over an Em7 vamp."
What is intonation and how can I find out if my guitar has correct intonation?,"Intonation refers to the instrument being in tune along the fretboard. An easy way to check the basic intonation of a guitar is to hit a 12th fret harmonic and compare the pitch with a note fretted at the 12th fret. If the fretted note is sharp, the string needs to be lengthened. If the fretted note is flat, the string needs to be shortened. The length of the strings can usually be adjusted at the bridge of electric guitars and basses. Tune each string to pitch before checking its intonation."
Unknown notation - thick horizontal bars between notes,"It's a tremolo. There are two types of tremolos. One between two different notes like in your example above and a second with the bars going though the stem of the note.  In your case, it is like a trill where you go back and forth pattern them in that patter at at a speed related to the bars connecting the two notes. So the two bars in the first measure would equate to 16th note speed and the three bars in the second measure would equate to 32nd note speed. The idea is that when the tremolo is finished you have played both notes the duration notated, but alternated at a certaint speed based on the number of bars. Here is the link I used to confirm the notation:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tremolo#Notation I would listen to a few examples so you get a good idea of what they are before you dive right into them. Hope this helps."
How to bend and release without flicking the other strings?,"It is hard to not touch other strings when you bend, especially if you bend wider than a semitone. The trick here is to mute strings that are not supposed to sound to eliminate unwanted noise instead of trying to not touch them. Some ways to do that are: Mute with the index finger of your fretting (left) hand and use middle and ring fingers to bend. Push your G string with ring and middle fingers and touch D string with the index finger like the guy on the picture below. This is a little tricky thing at first, but becomes easy with practice.
 Use palm of your picking (right) hand to mute all strings above the sounding one. Muting thicker strings with a palm is a common practice. Even if you are not trying to produce a 'palm muting' sound, you anyway touch unwanted strings with your palm.
 Muting with a thumb is another way. It is less common, but for some players is easier to do. Usually I do this for bends, and rest of the time I mute strings with the palm.
 Cheat with a string muter if you don't use open strings a lot. Some people consider that as a bad practice because it forms a bad habit of not muting the strings, but it can be acceptable for you if it helps you to sound better.
 It is a very useful habit to mute strings all the time, not only while you bend. Try to develop it by combining the ways described above, and you will notice that you play much cleaner than before. Good luck!"
"Is there a way to develop ""Perfect Pitch""? [duplicate]","I think a more realistic goal is to aim for relative pitch; then when you have that, perhaps try for perfect pitch. Relative pitch is essentially being able to recognise and identify intervals, relative to the root note.   Gaining relative pitch is fairly easy, a good way to do it is to pick a simple Major scale ditty, play it, and identify the intervals in it.   A good song for this is the Wedding march, R 4 4 4 R 5 4 5  etc. Then each time you need to figure relative pitch, refer back to the one or more ditties you have stored up.  Gradually over time this will become automatic, when it has become automatic, perfect pitch is the next stop. Perfect pitch is the holy grail for a musician; and is not easily obtainable without a lot of training.  It is doable though and I think some of the best training you can do for it is to learn how chords sound and the intervals within those chords; and each time you play/listen to something, think about how it sounds and what is actually going on."

"Is it easier to play ""softly"" on a grand piano?","Modern, large grand pianos still give the best feeling when playing. Upright pianos normally require more force and often don't allow soft notes to be played easily. The quietest note on an upright piano will normally be louder than the quietest note on a grand piano. Therefore, when practising soft pieces or fast, repetitive (Toccata-like) pieces, a grand piano is a great advantage. This is not necessarily because the keys are heavier, but because of fundamental design differences, for example the length of the key.
Every key extends into the interior of the piano. The length of the lever part of it is important: The longer, the easier to control the sound. Big grand pianos usually have very long keys and therefore are playable very well. I have a 120 years old upright with a quite peculiar action. After years of practise, I can somehow play softly on it, but I can play softer on a good grand after a minute of practise. However, a good, modern upright might still have a bit better action than a small, very old grand. If Yamaha says that their electric piano tries to mimic a grand piano, then this is a bold promise.
On the other side, improving over an average upright should not be too hard for an electric piano. Conclusion: Big grand pianos are the best pianos to play. Your ability to play soft on it will be much better than on a regular upright. A good electric piano might already be better than an average upright."
How do I know when it's time to change a tube on my amplifier?,"An important thing to note is the different types of valves can be changed independently of each other; eg: if you change the preamp valves you need not change the power amp valves etc. With power amp valves you will notice very quickly when one or more have gone.  The amp will give out noticeable and unpleasant tones/white noises and will be reduced in power; the glow that a healthy valve gives off may be different in colour or gone altogether, there may even be flames in the blown valves, which is pretty hard to miss. When changing power amp valves ensure that the amp has been cut off from the power for some time before you start, valves store a lot of power and can be dangerous if removed straight away. Preamp valves tend to last many times longer than power valves; so check the power valves first if they look ok then inspect the preamp valves closely; a blown preamp valve might also give off different noises than a power amp valve; such as excess feedback and other squeaks/screeches.   Also if a preamp valves goes you may not notice a reduction in power; which is another way to identify the type of valve which has gone. A good rule of thumb is; if you get a drastic change in tone or hum from your amp; or it wont power on at all; its time to check the valves.  If the valves look okay check all the cables carrying signals to the amp including the effects loop; if the amp wont power up check the power cable/fuses first. then check the valves.  With no power its not possible to check the glow colour of a valve so look for valves which are opaque or have burn residue on them. If you are unsure take it to a dealer for a service."
What is the difference between 'chorus' and 'refrain'?,"It gets more complicated. The term 'refrain' comes from a time when poems were routinely set to music, and  it is more appropriately left for the discussion of Classical and Romantic songs. At the turn of the nineteenth century, a popular or 'parlour' song was likely to have a verse and a chorus (or according to some old sheet music, the refrain). The verse set up the chorus (refrain). The chorus was typically AABA structure. At some point, for reasons described here, the verse tended to be omitted in recordings and Broadway performances. So now, everyone knows My Funny Valentine, but not everybody knows the verse, and we consider the AABA chorus (refrain) to be the entire song and not the chorus. More modern pop and rock songs moved to a Verse, Chorus, Verse, Chorus, Bridge, Chorus structure, in which the chorus was repeated, unchanged, and the term 'refrain' was cast aside. There ain't no refrain in Enter Sandman, and even if you found one, you'd be heckled for mentioning it. Flanders and Swann appeared to be in no doubt as to what constituted a refrain when they penned The Hippopotamus Song, because they actually wrote it in the lyrics (of the verse): A regular army of hippopotami
  All singing this haunting refrain   Mud, mud, glorious mud (etc.) BTW, The Sounds of Silence would be considered strophic in structure. Simon and Garfunkel came from the folk tradition, where strophic song structure had been all the rage for centuries."
Why is A4 the standard pitch reference for tuning?,"Had to do some digging for this one. First off, some informed speculation: A, of course, is the first letter in the alphabet, so its as good a place as any to define a standard. Plus, as you say, it is one of the open strings in common on all string instruments (along with D and G). The A above middle C is also a relatively centrally-located pitch, accessible to a range instruments. An octave lower would have been inaccessible to flutes and oboes (and not an open string). To expand on this: String instruments are relatively easy to retune, but also relatively quick to go out of tune (especially when strung with gut strings), so they should tune to the more stable wind instruments. The oboe was one of the first wind instruments to be regularly added to the orchestra (in the Baroque period), and, for whatever reason, it is now used as the pitch standard (there's another good question). Oboes can't hit G3, therefore, we have the following set of constraints: (*) I am not an oboist, but I'm sort of assuming here that, at least on early instruments, the D4, which was the second-to-lowest note on the oboe, might have been a bit harsh sounding. I found a quote from Berlioz' Treatise on Orchestration which agrees with this notion: ""The lower notes of the oboe, which sound ugly when exposed, may be suitable in certain harmonies of an eerie and sorrowful character..."" At any rate, I think the answer to your question will lie in discovering why the oboe is used as the reference pitch. Presumably, at least in the early Baroque, it would have been the continuo harpsichord (or organ) providing this reference, so maybe this shift coincided with the disappearance of continuo in the Classical era? Some additional historical information that may be relevant: In the early 6th century, when Boethius lists all the note names by letter, he starts (unsurprisingly!) with A as the lowest pitch. This presumably set a precedent for using A as a reference pitch. In 1711, British trumpeter John Shore invented the tuning fork which allowed accurate tuning to a reference pitch. He even gave one to Handel, with a pitch of C=512Hz, corresponding to your scientific pitch.  In 1834, Johann Heinrich Scheibler, a silk manufacturer and acoustics researcher, invented a ""tonometer"" for accurately measuring pitches, based on an array of fifty-two tuning forks, spanning a range of pitches fro A3 to A4. Why did he choose A? I don't know! But this device allowed him to study a range of tunings in use at the time. He describes his tonometer in detail in Der Physikalische Und Musikalische Tonmesser, which is apparently available on amazon, if you fancy original sources and can read German. Based on his studies, he recommended A4=440 to the Congress of Physicists in Stuttgart in 1834, which they accepted. The Streicher piano company also adopted this standard, manufacturing pianos with ""440"" stamped on the label. This wasn't the first attempt at standardized pitch, but due to Scheibler's tonometer, it was likely the most accurately measured standard up to that point. Nor would it be the last word in tuning; the French government passed a law on Feb. 16, 1859 requiring A=435, or ""Diapason Normal"" which would become widely adopted internationally. For more reading: http://www.dolmetsch.com/musictheory27.htm (contains a chart of various pitch references throughout time, including Stuttgart's decision) http://drjazz.ca/musicians/pitchhistory.html (contains more information on Scheibler, and the history of tuning forks and A=440)"
Why do E♯ and F♮ not sound the same (according to Wikipedia)?,"The thing is that the ""some tunings that define the notes in that way"" in the Wikipedia quote include the most common tuning today, 12-tone equal temperament (12-TET). So, E# and F natural do usually sound the same. ...But not always. Change the tuning system and you can easily have an E# and an F natural that sound slightly different. Just intonation will likely do it, since its perfect fifths are slightly larger than 12-TET's. (Just intonation is a mess the more of the chromatic scale you want to tune with it.)"
How do experienced pianists sight-read chords? [duplicate],"Many different ways! Some players who are extremely good readers will simply look at the dots and their fingers will automatically land on the correct keys. Others, like myself, will be expecting a choice of maybe 3 or 4 chords in a sequence, so will second guess what they will be.Then looking at the lowest note, working out rapidly what the inversion is, or might be. Not always good guesses, I might add. With the chord symbols above the staves, life is often easier, except when the name doesn't necessarily reflect the actual chord - more often in hand-written parts.  If it's a piece that's been heard before, I find I have a mental map of the chord sequence, sometimes vague, sometimes not bad, and that helps, as the left hand goes onto a kind of autopilot, and sometimes notes get left out, or an octave copy put in, none of which is too bad for the finished article. What will eventually happen for you is that in certain keys, you'll recognise clusters of dots, which will immediately make your fingers go to those chords. Rather like we recognise the shapes of long words, and don't have to sound out each phoneme or syllable. Simple example in A (bass clef)- 4 dots, each on one of the spaces = Amaj7. In G - dots on bottom 4 lines = Gmaj7. Just spoken to my brother-in-law, who's a good sightreader, and the question stumped him. Doesn't have a clue what he does..."
Advantage of 7-note based theory over 12-note alternative,"Not all music theory is based around 7-note scales, but the 7-note diatonic scale basically 'caught on' and became popular due to a number of subjectively useful properties it has. Most of its modes facilitate many opportunities for consonant harmony, chord building around triads, have notes that are close enough for easy melodic construction, and so on, while also giving some opportunity for interesting tensions and discords, and - also importantly - being fairly simple (7 notes is quite easy to get your head around!) So yep, a lot of 'standard'/'western' music theory is based around that scale. It seems very redundant to have both sharps and flats It enables you to give each note in any diatonic scale a distinct letter name, and a distinct line on the staff. All pitch classes seem as fundamentally important, why are 5 of them second class citizens and not assigned a proper letter? Well, if you begin by assuming use of the diatonic scale, you can see why 7 of the 12 notes are more important - because they're in that scale. At this point you might be thinking ""but there's more to life than the diatonic scale!"", and sure, there is. But here's a thing: Much of the reason that we have the chromatic (12 note) scale - and in particular 12-TET - is that it is a clever pattern in which 12 different diatonic scales fit together. More often than not, people use the chromatic scale to make music that can be viewed as still being based around broadly diatonic ideas, but with the added flexibility that 12-TET gives in terms of allowing modulations, chords from 'outside the key' still sounding good, and so on. Of course there is value in being to look at things from different viewpoints, and for some use cases, people do use terminology that gets away from the diatonic scale: we have pitch class sets, the chromatic staff, and so on. You could certainly imagine a parallel universe in which these ideas had gained a bit more currency. It may even happen in the future if music theoreticians (or product engineers!) build a 12-tone viewpoint of music that seems to offer particularly useful and important insights that a diatonic perspective doesn't. Of course notation and analysis suited to the 12-TET chromatic scale would still be scale-specific - it wouldn't qualify as some kind of 'pure' model for music. After all, one could reasonably ask: ""there are infinite possible pitches - what's so special about these 12?"""
"Why don't ""classical"" stringed instruments mark their note positions?","With many string instruments, it's seen as a bad thing to need to look at the fingerboard - often, it's desirable to be able to play the instrument by feel. This is essential if you're reading music at the same time, which in most classical contexts, you would be! Even in the pop/rock world it's often seen as better to be able to play by feel - many fretless bass guitars don't have fret markers either. With violin and viola, the player's view of the fingerboard is very foreshortened, so it might be hard to pick out an exact position even if it were marked. It's also hard using traditional construction methods to construct a fretless fingerboard with markers in a way that the markers don't interfere with the tone, and don't wear out easily. Inlays and paint both have their own problems. It is quite common for teachers to put stickers on the fingerboard while a student is in the early stages of learning, as a means to the end of learning to play by feel."
How is counterpoint different from harmony?,"The basis of counterpoint (point against point) is melody.  Harmony is evident in counterpoint which, I suppose, is what is causing the confusion.  A theory professor once told me that Harmony is a byproduct of the rules of counterpoint being used properly.  Counterpoint changed from renaissance to baroque in some significant ways.  Renaissance counterpoint is often referred to as melodic counterpoint while Baroque is referred to as Harmonic counterpoint.  Composers who used counterpoint (renaissance period composers) did not think about the harmony in terms of chords, our modern sense of harmony.  The melodic lines that were created using these counterpoint rules resulted in something that we can perceive as chords.  However their focus was solely on melodies and the way they interacted. Baroque counterpoint is structurally based around chords but the focus is still on melodic interaction.   One trick that is very commonly used in counterpoint is imitative counterpoint. In this trick a melody is introduced in one voice.  After the melody is completed, the same melody (often beginning at the interval of a fifth above the original melody) is introduced in a different voice while the first voice moves on to a secondary or counter-melody.   Listen for these types of thematic devices.  The melodies will be very pronounced.  Instead of hearing chords being sustained under a melodic line you will hear multiple melodies in multiple voices that come together to create a unique kind of harmony.  It is a very subtle composition technique.  I hope this helps. "
How do I know when I'm singing in key?,"Simple solution - record yourself and play it back, to yourself and others.  Do it a capella after giving yourself a key, and play along to the recording; and while playing guitar,You'll soon find out. It also sorts out good friends from bad!  Playing and singing with others also gives good feedback."
"How did composers ""test"" their music?","Not all composers nowadays write using computers. Many still write by hand using ink or pencil. Multi-instrument works (chamber, orchestra, etc) were written as either what's known as ""piano-score"" or ""short-score"". Many, many composers are / were pianists and so were able to check their music by playing through the piano score. Once they are satisfied with the music, they orchestrate it out to the size of the ensemble they're writing for. To learn how to do this, a common practice at the time for students was to hand-copy well-known composers' music. From this practice they would learn what worked for different types of instruments. During those times, brass and woodwind instruments were not as technologically advanced as they are today, so many of the wind parts (especially brass) were not especially complicated (though there were obviously virtuosi on those natural instruments, thinking about Hadyn's trumpet concerto or Mozart's horn concerti). Aside from these considerations, there are many sounds developed over the past century that weren't being used. For example, advances in technology have enabled composers to experiment with: sampling, recording, live-sound manipulation, electronic music, noise music, performance art, and multimedia art to name a few. As a consequence of science (i.e. electricity), many of these technologies did not exist and therefore the sounds / means of expression did not exist. This means a different level of experimentation, which means things are more standardized, which means things don't need to be checked as often. If you're involved with music deeply enough and for long enough, you become very familiar with the instruments, their techniques, and the sounds that come from them, which brings me to my last point: Experience. I've played horn though I wouldn't consider myself a horn player. When I write for horn, my experience tells me through my mind's ear how the horn will respond throughout it's range to different musical gestures. I don't need to go running to a horn player every time I write something for horn. That said, if I do write something and am not sure how it will come out, I'll reach out to a horn player for help; a whole orchestra is not needed. Other composers have done / do / will do the same thing: use prior experience (mistakes) as a guide and ask questions of individual players when they need them. Many university programs offer orchestral ""readings"" for students, which can also offer invaluable feedback."
Why is bass note so important in harmonic analysis of music?,"There is a rather more fundamental, physical reason for this than so far mentioned: the bass fills not only the bass frequency range, but its harmonics actually reach well into the midrange where all other voices have their fundamentals! In fact, since the bass has typically the strongest amplitude1 of all tuned instruments (save perhaps trumpets, lead vocals etc.), the middle voices have a hard time to really isolate themselves from these harmonics, at any time. Their harmonic function is thus always determined to a large degree by what interval they play over the bass. 1 This has again a particular reason: to make up for Fletcher-Munson, so the bass won't seem much quieter than everything else."
What is the Difference between Maple and Rosewood Fretboards,"Maple boards are typically placed on Swamp Ash or brighter wood bodies and it lends a snap to the tone of the guitar. Rosewood is known to be much mellower, and usually makes it's way on mahogany bodies and necks. They definitely feel different too. A maple neck is harder and feels very smooth under your fingers, while rosewood has some sponginess to it due to the porous properties of the wood. There are plenty of guitars out there that don't follow these traditional approaches so your mileage may vary. As to why they are chosen? I'd say tradition, along with the availability of the wood itself. It is however well known that woods lend specific tones to an instrument, so possibly years of experience and use by high quality luthiers have lent to the reputation of maple and rosewood. There are plenty of other fingerboard woods out there to choose from, but these two seem to be industry standards. Warmoth has a stellar site dedicated to the distinction between different tonewoods (neck and body). Here's the neck site. Enjoy!"
How can I be sure that I am singing effortlessly in my natural voice?,"I often start my warming up like this: I did this a few years ago and my head register connects smoothly to my chest register, while the feeling stays perfectly natural and without great exhaustion."
Is there a Relative Pitch Clef?,"In western staff notation every clef represent fixed set of notes so the what is written can easily be conveyed to any musician without much knowledge of the theory behind the notes just the knowledge of this is X note. Also note the key signatures themselves are set in a fixed pattern to simplify the reading for musicians. Even in the more loosely defined percussion (or neutral) clef, there is an understanding that the first space is for bass drum, the third space is for snare, and the space above the staff is for some kind of cymbal. The notation is meant for precision and not for theory and relativity. There are analysis techniques that can reduce harmony (chords) into relative ideas. The most widely used analysis is Roman Numeral Analysis and it's modern form the Nashville number system. These are extremely useful for chords and making them relative to any key, but it's not for melodies. There is a numbered musical notation popular in Asian countries. The basic idea is that the key is given and the notes are all numbers based on the scale degree. There is no clef because we are dealing with numbers instead notes on a staff. Here is the Wikipedia entry for the kind of notation. "
Why aren't there attempts to evolve classical musical instruments so that they're easier to play?,"Instruments are easier to play than they used to be. Take intonation, for example. Wind instruments don't play in tune by default. This is not a surprise to any player, or any parent of a junior-school concert band member. That being said, some take more skill to play in tune than others. Typically, modern instruments have better intonation (they are closer to being in tune by default). They still take skill, but you fight the instrument less. If we go back a year or two (hundred), a lot of work went into the world of wind instruments. Better design, better fingering. Similar efforts still happen today. Time will tell if they catch on. New instruments are invented all the time. Most of them are forgotten; some survive until now. The piano supplanted the harpsichord for a variety of reasons. Saxophones got snubbed by the orchestra, snuck into marching bands, and then ended up a staple of Jazz. And Kenny G. Ok, bad example. Electric guitars opened up a whole new way to cause tinnitus.  My point is that we do try new things all the time. Each new thing comes with a set of advantages, and disadvantages. Arranger keyboards can play along with you (making it easier to play certain styles), but they also play along with you (making it impossible to play anything else). Plastic reeds for woodwinds last longer and don't dry out, but they don't sound exactly the same as an organic one. Not necessarily worse, but not the same. We use iPads for sheet music. Well, I don't, but there's going to be a couple of them at rehearsal tomorrow night. Recorders are simpler than clarinets, but, well, it's a recorder.  So to answer your question, we do improve and innovate. We simplify. But most changes do not survive; too much compromise, limited benefit, or in the wrong place at the wrong time. Sort of like other art forms. I can paint using Paint. But that's not going to replace the paintbrush any time soon.  As a postscript, the music notation question comes up regularly. I would say we have invented a new sort of notation in the last hundred years; the chord chart (or lead sheet). It's well suited to improvisational styles. But it doesn't replace the conventional system. It solves a different problem. Replacing those five parallel horizontal lines has been attempted many times. I can count the number that succeeded on the fingers of zero hands. It would be like replacing the written spelling of the English language. The Americans got away with dropping the occasional 'u', but imagine changing everything. At the end of the day, why would you?"
"Aldous Huxley and 5/4 Meter in Music Predating ""Take 5""","Add to the list of well known 5/4 music Mussorgsky's Promenade from Pictures at an Exhibition. But really I think you need to also consider authentic folk music which can use odd meters or mixed meters. ...The saxophones wailed like melodious cats under the moon Early Duke Ellington would have the saxophones, so this description isn't out of the blue. But, notice the mocking tone: like melodious cats under the moon ...deturgescence. I don't think that is meant to be complimentary. Apparently Huxley liked jazz when he first heard it, but then later came is despise it. This page has a quote from Huxley about jazz in Do What You Will (1929)... It was the first time, I realised, that I had ever clearly seen a jazz-band. The spectacle was positively frightening… Oh, those mammy-songs, those love-longings, those loud hilarities! How was it possible that human emotions intrinsically decent could be so ignobly parodied? I felt like a man who, having asked for wine, is offered a brimming bowl of hog-wash. And not even fresh hog-wash. Rancid hog-wash, decaying hog-wash. For there was a horrible tang of putrefaction in all that music. Those yearnings for Mammy of Mine and My Baby, for Dixie and the Land where Skies are Blue and Dreams come True, for Granny and Tennessee and You – they were all a necrophily. The Mammy after whom the black young Hebrews and the blond young muffin-faces so retchingly yearned was an ancient Gorgonzola ; the Baby of their tremulously gargled desire was a leg of mutton after a month in warm storage ; Granny had been dead for weeks ; and as for Dixie and Tennessee and Dream Land – they were odoriferous with the least artificial of manures. My memory of Brave New World includes other negative comments about popular music, stuff about lyrics written by machines. To what extent had 5/4 time signatures been a part of the music predating the '60s, and is it possible that Huxley could have drawn influence from those pieces? I don't think the question is about how prevalent 5/4 meter was - enough answer here show it was used - but what was the attitude about the meter. Huxley was not being a music visionary in that passage by combining saxophones and 5/4 meter. He was combining various elements and descriptions of things un-pure both in the literal sense - 5/4 can be seen as a mixed meter - and the moral sense - 5/4 is wild, exciting, exotic, irregular, etc. It likely was conflating an odd meter like 5/4 and syncopation, both being kinds of metrical irregularities. The funny thing about comparing to The Dave Brubeck Quartet is they represented a certain level of respectability. The album Time Out - with 5/4 and other meters not in common time - is a technical and intellectual display. Quite a different image of jazz and attitude about irregular meter than the picture Huxley tried to paint in that description!"
Is CD audio quality good enough for the final delivery of music?,"Tentatively: Yes. As medium for final delivery, I've not yet seen any strong evidence that a well-designed 16-bit, 44,100 Hz system can be significantly improved on as a vehicle for listening to the final mix (and therefore, from a musician's perspective, as a vehicle for presenting the final mix.) When I looked into this a few years back, I was disappointed to find a relative lack of seemingly well-conducted tests compared to the level of interest in the subject. I certainly didn't find anything that seemed to strongly suggest that there was any major listener benefit in 'higher-definition' audio. (I'm writing this answer partly because I'd be very grateful if anyone knows different!) Just to provide a little further reading - here are some anecdotes of tests that deal with bit depth and sample rate.  Of course a particular 16-bit listening experience might be devalued by recording levels being too low (resulting in a perceptible noise floor), OR by over-aggressive limiting of peaks to stay within the headroom. That's an example of where recording initially to a higher bit-depth initially would have been valuable. Likewise, a 44.1K DAC with a badly-designed anti-aliasing filter might sound bad - but this doesn't seem to be inevitable with the current state of technology. Edit: I have just found this paper, published since I last explored this, that concludes that ""there was a small but statistically significant ability to discriminate between standard quality audio(44.1or48kHz,16bit) and high resolution audio (beyond standard quality)"", based on review of a number of experiments in this area. However, it also states that this ability to discriminate is something that is far more significant when subjects were trained, and still concludes that ""the ability to discriminate high bit depth, e.g., 24 bit versus 16 bit, remains an open question"". So it still seems reasonable to call CD quality 'good enough', even if 'very slightly better' may be possible."
Is there any way to improve composing?,"Listen to as much music as possible in as many styles as possible and force yourself to listen to music that you aren't familiar with or even don't like. You can't progress from a point of no reference. Like when you learn to speak, you learn vocabulary from practice and by emulating others. Then, after you've built up a broad vocabulary, you can start to talk like your own self. The same is true with composing (or playing for that matter). Technically speaking, theory certainly won't hurt. If you learn proven and accepted ways of doing things ""right"", then you can be more confident when you break those theory ""rules"". But remember, it is all still theory. You need to let your own ear guide you through. Also, don't spend all your time writing at the computer if you can help it. A computer is a great tool and can certainly ease a lot of pain when writing, but it is just a tool. The music still comes from you. Use a pencil and paper and you'll see the difference. They both have their places. Finally, for some practice, try to write every single day, even when it feels difficult. If you can only write a couple of bars in a day, then that's still better than nothing. If you need some structure around that, try just writing melodies and don't pay attention to key or even a time signature. Just work on melody. If you do that and practice it, you'll start to learn to incorporate that into your compositions in a practical way. Melody is king."
How to identify the root note of a chord,"The root note is always the note that is the basis for the chord, regardless of its inversion.  In root position the lowest note is the root (hence the name), but other notes are the lowest in other inversions of the chord. For example, take a C Major chord.  In every position, the root note is C.  Whether it is voiced as C-E-G (root position), E-G-C (first inversion), or G-C-E (second inversion) is irrelevant.  (The voicing is always given from the lowest note to the highest.) There are multiple ways to interpret chords as well.  For example, C-E-A could be considered a C Major 6th in root position or an A minor chord in first inversion.  How you interpret it depends upon its function in the song as well as the song's key.  In the key of A minor you would definitely consider it to be an A minor chord. C-E-A could also be considered a rootless F Major 7th chord (normally F-A-C-E) in second inversion.  You might interpret it this way in certain F Major pieces, for example.  In this case you might say it has no root, or that the root is an ""implied"" F. As for reading the notation and playing it, a couple points:"
How can a non-musician recognize anacrusis?,"Anacrusis (pickup) is a bit more rhythmic than melodic. Hearing it seems easy to my musical brain, but I can understand how it would not be easy for others. Most music has a set rhythm, which we can understand in its simplest form by saying there is a fairly low number (most commonly 4), to which one can repeatedly count while listening to a piece of music, such that the piece will seem to flow with the counting. Wait, what does that even mean? Let's use Happy Birthday as an example. If you count ""one two three one two three one two three"" repeatedly while someone is singing Happy Birthday, you'll hear/feel that the song seems to flow along with your counting, except you can't start the song with ""one"" right when the singer first says ""Happy-"". You have to start your count on ""three"" and then go back to ""one"", with the ""one"" matching when the word ""Birthday"" is sung. That's anacrusis. Here's a chart-like thing to hopefully make it more visual: So by now you're probably ready to ask, ""Wait, why don't we just make 'one' fall on 'Happy' and then 'two' for 'birthday' and so on?"" Excellent question, and this is the very core of anacrusis, and even rhythm in general. How do we know that it's a three-count? How do we know where the 'one' is? Mainly, we feel it. When we sing Happy Birthday, we tend to naturally emphasize the syllables ""birth-"" and ""you"". Having the emphasis on the ""one"" is a popular component of rhythm, so it's a good bet when we are counting a song to put the ""one"" on emphasized syllables. That means we have to get a sense of the spacing between emphasized syllables (or beats) in order to know how high to count (e.g., ""1 2 3 1 2 3"" or ""1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4"", etc.). To get back to the question at hand, how can you determine whether anacrusis is part of the music you are hearing? That last phrase in step three is really what the articles you read seem to be about. Anacrusis could be in the eye of the beholder. Going back to the question of why we don't just count ""one"" on ""Happy"" in Happy Birthday, we could actually count ""one"" on ""Happy"" and then count sixes or twelves or even fours (which would create a different feel, sometimes called ""three over four"") and then we would not consider there to be anacrusis for Happy Birthday. Anacrusis and the rhythms we typically apply to music are merely conventions of western music theory, and other cultures can and certainly do develop theories and musical ideas that don't match, or even outright clash with the concepts that have their origins in western Europe and even back to ancient Greece. So when talking among people who understand western music theory, you might describe a piece as having anacrusis, but if the artist(s) who composed and/or perform that piece don't see it that way, or don't even have that concept in their view of music, that is a valid point of view. Here's a map of Mary Had a Little Lamb (non-blues children's version) to contrast with the Happy Birthday map above:"
"Physics behind why a bugle can play several notes, while a whistle only plays one note","On some types of whistle if you blow really hard you can get the second harmonic, sounding one octave higher than the fundamental.  A recorder is essentially a whistle with the length of the resonating chamber controlled by the fingers, and you can very easily overblow an octave. Brass instruments more easily play their overtones because you're in direct control of the vibration.  Playing a brass instrument is essentially singing with your lips, with the instrument snapping the pitch to the nearest overtone.  You don't have this kind of direct control over a whistle."
"Coated Strings—Gimmick, or worth the money?","I can definitely attest to the fact that they last longer. I have very sweaty hands and I used to decimate acoustic guitar strings--we're talking a new set about every week and a half. Once I used coated strings I cut the change time to about a month. As to their tonal difference, I personally like darker sounding acoustics so it was a non-issue for me. As for cost, a regular pack of light gauge Martin acoustic strings costs $4.99, and a pack of Elixers is $14.99 per pack. So, assuming we consume one pack of strings per week (let's say you have sweaty hands like me) then the total cost per month on average would be 4.99 x 4 = $19.96. Therefore, in order for it to be more cost effective to use coated strings they must last at least one month or longer. Your mileage may vary depending on the types of strings you choose to use and how long they last. You'll also obviously be changing strings less frequently--so you'll save yourself a little time and trouble there. It takes me about 5 minutes to swap my strings out so it's not a benefit to me per say, but if you hate changing strings or it takes you longer you could realize this benefit. Hope that was helpful!"
What exercises can I do to improve my timing?,"I would first try to focus on your timing and nothing else.  If you can play in time that way, it's probably just a matter of practice to nail down your time and get away from the loose rhythm. If you still have trouble, cut out everything except you and the metronome.  You don't want extra beats or notes to interfere with that you're doing.  If you can't play in time this way, you need to work on your technique and/or strength.  Slow down to the point where you can play perfectly in time, even if it's just single notes in time to the metronome.  Play scales and arpeggios this way (I'm assuming you're playing an instrument where this is possible) to build strength.  Only when you can consistently play in time should you increase your speed. Playing anything out of time reinforces the bad habit of playing out of time.  If you find yourself unable to correct rhythmic errors, I've always found it helpful to immediately back off the tempo and play at a pace where I can get the timing right.  Drill it in, make it automatic, and then increasing the tempo should be easier.  If it doesn't work, go back and drill again before re-attempting the faster pace."
Recycling guitar strings,"I think this is exactly what you are looking for.  From the site: ...a campaign to collect and distribute used guitar strings to needy musicians throughout the world. This effort will help keep musical creativity alive...Many touring artists use a set of guitar strings for a few gigs and then change them, and throw them away. These strings are like gold in some places on this planet. Send them to me, and I'll get them into the right hands...and as you know there are plenty of six string guitars out there with five stings on 'em. Sorry about the delay in answering. I knew I had seen this somewhere, but couldn't quite put my finger on it. It took me a while before the google-fu worked."
What do the letters D and E above the staff represent here?,"According to the notes given at the beginning of my score: In large orchestras, from rehearsal [94] on, wherever the letter D appears in the 2 Flutes, Oboes, E♭ and C Clarinet parts, these parts are to be doubled. (EDITOR'S NOTE: The doubling ceases where the letter E appears in these same parts.) I've personally never seen this particular notation before, but it may be related to the German ""doppelt besetzt"" (doubled) and either ""einfach besetzt"" (single-voiced) or ""einzeln"" (single)."
Are doubly augmented and doubly diminished intervals practical?,The last piece in Ligeti's Musica Ricercata is a good example of double diminished everything. But these intervals in the piece occur only because of polyphony. I'm quite sure that if you dig up some early or very late Shostakovich you'll be able to find examples of more harmonic and melodic (rather than polyphonic) use of double diminished intervals. Shostakovich is a very frequent user of diminished and double diminished intervals.
Why does violin sound differently after playing on it for some time?,"This is a heavily-researched, and (sadly) highly inflammatory topic.  There are some people who swear it takes 50 years for the varnish to reach a stable structure & stability; there are others who say it's due to the wood itself aging and ""settling"" in at the cellular level. I'm not aware of anyone who's had the time and the cash to put a couple brand new instruments into a closet, wait 10 years, and play them for the first time.  So the ""play the instrument"" vs. ""temporal aging"" debate remains untested from a scientific point of view.  <-- if anyone knows of a study like this, I'll happily retract this part of the answer. Wood is funny stuff.  The source species, growth rate (annual ring size), sheet quality, etc. has all sorts of effects on the final sound. I recently bought an 1842 cello w/ wonderful sound.  But during my search, I played some 1-yr old instruments with better sound and better responsivity than 80-yr old ones.  It's really one step away from dark magic when trying to figure out how an instrument becomes a good one or a bad one :-) So, ok, I LMGTFM (...for myself :-) ) .  Here are a few reports. This one suggests that adding fungi can improve tone quality.
Here's one of many which claim that pro violinists can't tell the difference between new axes and Strads.
Here's a brief study of shapes and f-hole sizes .
Presumably this is part one of a longitudinal study of aging.
And finally, a study showing thatvibrating a guitar doesn't change its sound quality."
What is the practical reason for reentrant tuning on ukulele and similar instruments?,"Strings for these instruments were, historically, made from sheep gut or cow gut. In some situations it wouldn't be possible to make a thicker lower string, so a higher-octave string is substituted. In other situations there would be a point at which it isn't possible to make a thinner string that could be tuned higher. Such a string would be too weak and would break just from tuning it up to pitch. So the solution was to use a string tuned an octave lower in its place. Reentrant tunings and strings have been used as long as there have been stringed instruments that were used to strum chords. That would take us at least back to the early 1600s with the appearance of the Baroque guitar. Update: The ukulele only dates from the 1880s, but it is descended from the Portuguese guitar (brought to Hawaii by Portuguese traders and colonizers) which is, in turn, descended from the Baroque guitar. The Baroque guitar used a reentrant tuning from its inception around 1646. Before that there was the lute, going back to antiquity, and also using reentrant tunings. So one reason that the ukulele has a reentrant tuning is that it comes from a continuous line of reentrant-tuned instruments going back hundreds of years before the invention of the ukulele."
How do I get out of my song writing rut and compose something new and fresh for a change?,"TLDR; Listen to new music, play in new keys, try to emulate other styles/genres, choose new chord progressions and approach your writing from a different perspective, ie, which instrument you write on, both for accompaniment and melody. What you are experiencing is entirely normal.  As humans we have managed to survive and evolve due to our recognition of patterns and creating habits that will ensure our safety and health.  Our brain is basically wired to recognize and work with patterns.  Part of the way we learn to play music is through pattern recognition.  You seem to understand this to some extent or another but I find it important to mention that it is not only normal but natural.  Now onto breaking habits/finding new ways to creatively express your musical self! One way patterns are formed is through the music we listen to.  Every genre has certain characteristics that define it.  So when we listen to one genre more than others, those characteristics tend to find a home in our musical minds.  The tendencies of different genres can be those of melodic choice, harmonic choice, rhythmic choice, etc.  One way to pull yourself out of relatively repetitive composition choices is to expose yourself to new music.  Most people don't really listen to just one genre but often have one or two that are the most prevalent in their library.  The idea would be to listen to those genres less (for a time) and to listen to some new music for you, allowing you to focus your ears on different characteristics and tendencies.  I've always enjoyed Jazz but Smooth Jazz always seemed so cheesy to me that I never appreciated it.  I started listening to the Smooth Jazz station in my area and started to enjoy a lot of it (and not just because of the slap bass and lead bass).  A while later, I listened back on a track that I had been writing and realized that the melody was much different than my usual style and that it was rather reminiscent of Smooth Jazz.  I wasn't trying to write a song within that genre but my extended exposure allowed it to seep into my brain and influence my melodic choices. When listening to the different music, try to focus on all the aspects of what makes that genre work.  How do the drums and bass work with the melody?  How do the harmonies support that melody.  A great exercise is to try to rebuild a song or imitate it.  You can even do this from a pseudo-parody standpoint.  Imitate the music that you don't really enjoy and try to make fun of it.  You won't be able to put together a good parody of a genre if you don't fully understand its structure, which very much includes the melody.  A lot of Frank Zappa's music was parody based.  He was pretty much making fun of all the DooWop/RnB of his time and actually ended up writing better (IMO) songs than most of what the artists he was making fun of were.  He did an entire album making fun of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Lots of modern music tends to focus less on melody.  A lot of Rock music will kind of hover on one note and use different pitches more to express what the lyrics are saying.  Essentially this music would not be considered melodic in nature.  Classical and Jazz tend to put most of the focus on a melody and everything else just supports that melody.  So listening to melodically driven music will help a lot. Chord progressions are another thing that tend to be fairly standardized within genres and that leads to my next point.  The chords that are chosen will often lead someone in a melodic direction because of genre tendencies.  If you play a blues progression a lot, you're probably going to write a bluesy melody.  So one way to break compositional tendencies within yourself is to try new chord progressions.  Certain chord progressions, specifically non-diatonic progressions, basically demand notes that would not usually occur, or provide the landscape for different notes to fit.  I would try messing around with some Modal Mixture/Borrowing to start.  If that is something you already do, try to make it more drastic, such as every other chord being borrowed.  This may not yield your favorite music but it will likely force you to sing/play different melodic notes, opening up your vocabulary.  You can also try modulations but place them differently than you may otherwise, such as a mid-verse modulation, so that half of a verse is in one key and the other half is in another.  That could potentially make a repeat melody sound less like the other song. The types of chords you use will also impact this.  If you use strictly triads, then your consonant notes are a bit different than if you are using Maj/Min 7 chords and the landscape changes even more if you are adding extensions and alterations to your chords, where nearly any of the chord tones and extensions can have a consonant feel to them.   Similarly, chord voicings can impact which notes sound/feel more consonant.  By varying the types of chords you use and the voicings of any chords that you choose, you will be pulling the music in another direction, opening up new melodic choices.  One thing that is very commonly considered on piano/keyboard that seems to be less of a consideration on guitar is that the top note of your chord voicings tend to poke out as a melody and many try to write their keyboard parts to have the top note follow the melody or sit below it.  This can be applied to any chordal instrument, so simply changing your voicings may bring new melodies in itself. Approaching your music from another angle is always helpful as well, like you mention in the question.  Starting with a fully written chord progression, one that is written without considering what the melody will be, may help your process.  You mention using another instrument to write with and that will likely be helpful because the usual tendencies you may have on a guitar would not directly translate to a keyboard.  But one important thing to try is writing the melody itself on the instrument.  Our voices tend to be best at executing familiar patterns, as our voice is something we use all the time; it is innate to us.  It tends to be rather difficult to sing brand new ideas, such as certain notes that are less consonant or certain melodic passages, so we end up not singing them.  By writing a melody on your guitar, you can access the consistency of an instrument you understand well but not fall into the vocal tendencies.  Different instruments will give you different rhythmic patterns and melodic patterns. You can also try a relatively random approach.  Randomly pick a handful of notes and find a way to create a melody out of them, even if they seem to have no harmonic relationship or tonal center.  This is more of an exercise to expand your palette, so you might not get ideas that you want to turn into a song, but you never know. Your choice of key is also very important in this conversation.  As I mentioned before, the voice has tendencies and places of comfort that can be somewhat hard to break.  Lots of songwriters end up writing most of their tunes in just a handful of keys, often dictated by the instrument they write on.  Guitars tend to write in ""sharp"" keys (keys with sharps in the key signature), such as E, A, G, D.  Guitarists tend not to write in Eb very much because it is harder on that instrument and you can't get that satisfying low tonic.  So our voices tend to sing best or feel best in certain ranges and some people may choose to write in certain keys for how they fit into their vocal range.  By writing in new keys, you will either need to stretch your voice to have your melodic concepts be able to take flight within that key, or you need take a different approach.  Basically if you are in a different key and you want to sing in your comfortable range, you will be forced to make different melodic choices, such as which chord tones you tend to choose, how you move between notes, etc. You can also try picking different notes as your ""climax"".  People tend to hit certain notes very strongly and use those to create the climax of the piece.  By choosing a different note than usual, you will change the character of your climax. And I have now written another wall of text answer...  The important thing to remember here is that you have tendencies in your writing for a reason, be it the brain's natural response, or the music that you choose to listen to.  Changing how you write and what you listen to will definitely change what you write.  You can try any number of things but you should be able to find ways to force yourself into a new direction when you find yourself stuck in certain patterns by either exposing yourself to different influences, or by forcing yourself to write a melody with different notes than usual.  Don't stick yourself in a spot where every song you write has to be perfect and something you want to perform; give yourself some exercises and practice your writing, just like you would practice your playing."
What kind of a guitar can I play without thumbs?,"Consider switching to the ukulele.  With only four strings, your left thumb is not needed to hold down strings, and you might find the lower tension and smaller neck of the uke easier to hold than a guitar.  A pick is not needed with a uke, and many people strum with their index finger, so your right thumb is not necessary, either."
Can I just tune my guitar how ever I like?,"[I]s it really weird/uncommon to just tune the notes however the heck
  I want? Contemporary guitar practice includes a large number of tunings. Commonly used systems include open tunings (where the open strings are tuned to sound a particular diatonic chord), slack tunings (where the standard series of intervals between strings is preserved, but the entire tuning is lowered by some number of semitones, usually between one and five) and dropped tunings (where the standard series of intervals is preserved for all strings except for the sixth string, which is lowered to form a perfect fifth interval with the fifth string), but that is hardly an exhaustive list. Using a non-standard tuning is certainly a valid artistic choice. Can I just tune my guitar how ever I like? Having said the above, there are limits to what is possible and/or practical that result from the physical properties of guitars and strings, as well as your hands. Guitars and strings are designed to operate within a specific range of tensions. If a string is stretched too tight (tuned too high) it is more likely to break. Excess tension on the guitar neck - as a result of tuning a number of strings too high - can result in warping or breakage. I have personally witnessed bridges being pulled off acoustic guitars due to excess string tension. Another potential issue is intonation along the length of the string. A guitar is typically set up with certain assumptions about what strings will be used - including material and thickness; and therefore, tension - and how they will be tuned. If you choose to string and/or tune your guitar differently, it is possible that the strings will not remain in tune along the entire length of the fingerboard. This can be remedied through intonation adjustment - if your guitar permits such a thing. Most acoustic and classical guitars have fixed bridge saddles, however, making intonation adjustments difficult, if not outright impossible. Finally, the standard guitar tuning has evolved to facilitate a wide variety of material and playing styles. Alternative tunings tend to be more specialised, so they might make it much easier to play certain pieces or styles (for example, open tunings are favoured by slide guitar players), at the cost of making other things more difficult. If you only need to play one particular song, whatever tuning makes it easiest is perfectly fine (within the limits set out above). If you want to play a large variety of material, an unorthodox tuning may be a hindrance. Also do I have to play with the neck pointing right or left, it feels most comfortable for me to lay my guitar on my right thigh and my left hand on the neck of the guitar. If I understand you correctly, this would be a lap guitar style - the guitar is laid in the lap of the player with the strings facing upwards and the player plays with both hands reaching down, much like a keyboard player might. This way of playing guitar is most often used by slide players - for example, Pink Floyd's David Gilmour - as it is closely related to lap-steel guitar (essentially, a pedal-less version of pedal steel), but as Tim points out, it has also been used by guitarists who fret with their fingers, such as Jeff Healey. It is not common, but - again - is a perfectly valid artistic choice. I just want to make sure i'm not going to embarrass myself up on stage when other guitar players notice i'm doing everything wrong. It is possible that you might get asked why you play in an unusual way, in which case ""because it's easier for me like this"" is a completely sensible answer. At the end of the day, the quality of your performance is what matters. Whatever lets you reach your musical goals is good. EDITED: Alternate stringing methods Aside from different tunings, some guitarists also choose alternative stringing methods - changing the order in which the strings are put on the guitar. The best-known alternative is reverse stringing - reversing the order of the strings, low to high, so that the lowest string is closest to the floor when the guitar is held in a conventional fashion and the highest string is furthest from it. This is typically done to enable a left-handed guitarist to play a right-handed guitar (or vice versa), by holding it upside down. Jimi Hendrix is the canonical example of this, having played upside-down, right-handed guitars extensively. Reverse stringing isn't the only possiblity, however. It is possible to come up with any number of alternative stringing methods - from reducing the number of strings to changing their order (one example I have seen involved having the bass strings in the middle of the fingerboard, surrounded by the higher ones). Alternative stringing methods may involve non-conventional tunings, as well, especially if the order of strings is changed considerably. As with alternative tunings, alternative stringing systems can be quite specialised - making some things easier, while other things are harder, than if conventional systems were used. Reverse stringing - when used to convert a guitar for reverse-handed play - is an exception here, since the resulting stringing and tuning is standard, albeit suited to a different handedness than the guitar was originally built for. The importance of standard tuning and technique It has been pointed out in the comments that - while using alternative stringing, tuning and playing posture is a perfectly valid artistic choice - there is a lot to be said for developing proficiency with standard tuning and playing styles. It is a sentiment I wholeheartedly agree with. I have have stressed repeatedly in this answer, that alternative stringing, tuning and posture involves trade-offs. The ""normal"" way of doing things is standard for a reason: it works best in a wide variety of applications. Following mainstream instrumental teaching allows us to tap into a legacy left by generations of past musicians, who have refined both the instrument and the playing techniques. When we choose to step outside these bounds, we are given freedom to explore new musical territory, but we are faced with a whole host of new mistakes we must make ourselves, in order to learn from them. Having a solid foundation in well-trodden territory can be quite helpful when we decide to strike out into the wilds."
How to play a long sustained note on an electric guitar?,"I know both Steve Hackett and Robert Fripp. I have interviewed them for articles I published in guitar magazines. You are asking about an unusual effect that requires special equipment. To get the sounds you described, early in their careers, Steve Hacket used the hand-held electro-magnetic bowing device called the EBow. Later on they used the Fernandes Sustainer installed in their guitars.  The Fernandes Sustainer is not really a pickup at all. It sits in a pickup cavity on the guitar, but it is a device that creates an alternating magnetic field that causes the strings to vibrate continuously as if it were being bowed by a violin bow. It can be used to create completely clean ""infinite sustain"" sounds, including chords, that are very different in character than what you get with a compressor pedal or with distortion or amp feedback. As long as you hold a note or chord, it never dies out or decays (as long as the batteries are working). Today, both Hackett and Fripp will only perform with electric guitars with a Fernandes Sustainer installed. Furthermore their guitars have Floyd Rose-type tremolo bridges and not a hard-tail bridge. Here is a link to Robert Fripp's signature model of guitar, from his luthier, Crimson Guitars. It comes with a Fernandes Sustainer. Here is a link to Steve Hackett's own description of his guitar collection. The guitars he performs with today all have a Fernandes Sustainer.  Similarly, Adrian Belew's signature Parker guitar uses a Sustainiac, a variant on the Fernandes Sustainer. (and I know Adrian, too). Again, it has a tremolo bridge and not a hard-tail bridge. Four years ago an entirely new system came on the market: the Moog Guitar. It is much more sophisticated in its ability to create clean sustaining sounds than either the EBow or the Fernandes Sustainer. Check the link for demo videos and recordings from Moog. You can buy a relatively inexpensive Fernandes guitar with a Sustainer already installed, or you can purchase a Sustainer kit and have it retrofitted to an existing guitar. However, you will need to route out the body to make room for the extra components and batteries that the Sustainer system requires. Neal Schon, Steve Vai, and The Edge are also Fernandes Sustainer endorsers."
"Is ""16va"" proper notation?","First off 2 octaves above or below is a 15th because an octave is 7 letter named notes above a unison (P1) so to get the first octave you have 1 + 7 = 8. 7 more notes above that is the next octave so 8 + 7 = 15. However it is very rare because as you inferred, it is rare that a pianist will play that high up and also it is much easier to understand just the 8va or 8vb than 15ma or 15mb. Also from a practical standpoint the grand staff can comfortably fit 5 octaves from C2 to C6 which is equivalent to 60 keys on the piano. If you introduce notation for an octave above or octave below, you now cover 7 octaves from C1 to C7 which is equivalent to 84 keys. Since the normal max for a piano is 88 keys, you can see that having 8va or 8vb gives you access to pretty much every note within two ledger lines of the grand staff.  8va is the abbreviation for the Italian ""all'ottava"", or ""at the octave (up)"" while 8vb is the abbreviation for ""all'ottava bassa"" or ""at the octave below"". The notation does exist, and you may see it when you have a part that repeats itself multiple times, each time an octave higher. I personally have never seen any song with that notion, but it does exist. "
Is there any way to find a key of song somehow mathematically/algorithmically?,"There's no such thing as a 100% sure identification of what 'the key' of a song is if you aren't taking notation as your reference - sometimes different people hear the same song as being in different keys. But if you have MIDI files, you have most of the same information that someone listening to a song would do - i.e. you have all the notes - so yes, you can make a fairly good go at finding out the key.  Basically all you need to do is work out how you'd work out the key of a piece by ear, and then turn that into an algorithm. How can you find the key of a song by ear? Mentions some relevant information, and you may find other useful techniques for finding the key of the song by ear around this site and the web.  As well as the  Krumhansl-Schmuckler algorithm mentioned by Dom, if you're a coder (I see that you have a stack overflow account), this could be a great problem to solve using machine learning, assuming you have a suitable training set of MIDI files with the key already correctly identified. You'd probably want to distil down the data in the song - for example, you could do an analysis that worked out  ...and then pass that in as the inputs to a suitable neural network and training algorithm. You could also consider the algorithm that Dom mentioned when deciding how to slice up the data. You might only end up with a trained NN that generates similar answers to to the Krumhansl-Schmuckler algorithm though! You might also want to consider how you're going to deal with pieces that identifiably change key over the course of their development.  One more thing - MIDI does have the concept of a Key Signature meta message. This might not often be present or reliable but it could be another data point."
What are the limitations of the ABC notation format?,"My sense (after writing parsers for ABC, MusicXML, Cappella, Noteworthy, and about 6 other formats; and output to Lilypond, etc.) is the limitations of ABC, the format, cannot be completely separated from the limitations of ABC parsers.  As both Kevin and Chris noted above, the ABC format has the capacity to encode much of the complexity of MusicXML and Lilypond and other formats, so it is not especially limited with respect to those formats (though the precise formatting and layout options of MusicXML and Lilypond, necessary for storage of a score that can be reconstructed, are rudimentary). The limitations arise in that an ABC parser cannot know from the data format what types of ABC extensions or seldom-used features it may encounter at any moment or how the language may evolve in the future. As far as I am aware, there is no formal grammar for a well-formed ABC document that would let a programmer know where the following chain of elements (lyrics, voices, etc.) would end. Contrast with MusicXML where the XML format of <tag>contents</tag> has a sort of encapsulation that is easy to parse and can be tolerant towards future changes in the specification. (Lilypond is harder to parse or generate in this way, but it does have a grammar specification that can help).  The difference means that MusicXML readers (or the few Lilypond readers) can know whether a file is well-formed in advance, and selectively parse or read elements that may or may not be relevant to the task. With ABC notation, it can be extremely difficult to skip information that may be correct but from a different (older or future) standard. Because it evolved from a (great) way of simply editing music, some aspects of the implied grammar are contradictory or and can lead to very different output depending on which parser or interpreter is used.  For instance, the 2.1.1 (dev) spec says, ""A percent symbol (%) will cause the remainder of any input line to be ignored."" however, later ""A stylesheet directive is a line that starts with %%, followed by a directive that gives instructions to typesetting or player programs."" (as in the %%score directive above). Such non-standard additions let the format grow according to the needs of the community, but make parsing of important features difficult and leave a somewhat non-standard standard.  Important constants or attributes, especially in these directive signs, are left undefined: one can see that there is a ""%%papersize"" directive, which can be followed by ""A4"", but is the US version of this directive ""letter"" or ""8.5x11"" or ""8.5"" or ""8.5/11""? In Lilypond or MusicXML such constants are well-defined. If the OP wants more specific limitations rather than philosophical, some important ones: little or support for tuplets beyond basic information (how they should be displayed (number, ratio, no sign), nested tuplets, placement in metronome/metric modulation marks); many fewer ornament (decoration) signs; support for early music signs (full in Lilypond; a few in MusicXML) and contemporary notation symbols (diamond harmonics; cluster chords; microtones etc.; full in Lilypond; some in MusicXML); control over positioning of grace notes, in particular grace note groups in multiple parts (useful for a Beethoven symphony); different key signatures in different parts (very important for Beethoven symphonies; needed even after the transposition settings are complete since trumpets should not have marked key signatures in any transposition). Richer metadata (arranger, copyright [for the piece, separate from the encoding]), precise control over bar numbering schemes. Rich instrument playback support (in MusicXML 3.0; as opposed to pure MIDI number). None of that is to say that ABC is a limited format -- it's incredible for making simple things simple and writing music by hand in a text file, but for something as large as a Beethoven symphony, I believe that the limitations will make it a vexing choice. (edited:) You asked if there was a non-subjective way to decide how important these features are; I tried to answer in the context of notating Beethoven symphonies, since you used that example, but let me answer in the context of how people might use notation here, maybe a bit less subjective. For questions about ""What does X obscure symbol mean?"" It'll be much more possible to make that symbol in Lilypond or MusicXML (assuming it's a baroque trill sign, a contemporary notation sign, etc.); of course the questioner probably couldn't use it in his question, since he'd have to know the name for it, but an answerer could use it in her response. Guitar chords are often discussed here; they can be written in ABC, but except for this list they have no semantic meaning (treated like text expressions); they are fully supported in both other formats (along with figured bass for baroque music questions). For theory questions (""What's an augmented 6th chord"") ABC would work fine and be much easier to enter."
Why does music seem to transpose when I yawn?,"In The Physics and Psychophysics of Music: An Introduction by Juan G. Roedere, a footnote on page 107 reveals this gem: ...there is also a shift in pitch when the pressure in the cochlear
  fluid changes (e.g., pitch shifts perceived during yawning)... And according to this Nature Physics paper, Mammalian pitch sensation shaped by the cochlear fluid, pitch shifts need not be purely cognitive constructs. In other words, physically changing the pressure in the cochlear fluid can affect pitch perception. But these merely reveal a connection between the two events, what would the mechanism of pressure change be? The final piece is answering the question, ""Does yawning increase the cochlear fluid pressure?"" The answer can be found in any physiology textbook like this one here. The Eustachian tube is normally closed, but it can be pulled open by
  yawning, chewing, and swallowing. Such opening permits air pressure
  within the middle ear to equilibrate with atmospheric pressure so that
  pressures on both sides of the tympanic membrane are equal. And of course, changing the pressure around the ear drum causes fluid pressure inside the cochlea to change in a way we are all familiar with because that's how we perceive sound from our environment.

"Where do the double accidentals go in ""theoretical"" key signatures?","I cannot give you any reference, but I'll try to give a typographer's insight into the problem and state my opinion. I hope it's fine. Typography has some basic rules, and they are in general applied in this order: Applying these rules, I would go with the double sharp in the end. The reason is that primarily you want to focus on the delivered message, and that is that the key is significantly odd. Basically, we want to break the ""invisibility"" rule, we want the signature to stand out. And this is what you do. First, it starts with C# rather than the usual F#, and second, I believe (I can't support this by any study though) that if you only count the sharps, the one at the end is more noticeable than the one at the beginning. Actually, purely from my mathematical point of view, I would also consider the following option viable. It best delivers the message that the key is G# major / E# minor, but the first F# is or at least could be confusing. "
"My child's violin practice is making us tired, what can we do?","Also, she becomes irritated when we point her mistakes and give advice on how to correct them, resulting in more time being wasted trying to calm her down. You are not her teacher.  Violin is a cruel mistress.  Your daughter presumably wants to play the violin, not work the violin.  Find some room (even if in the basement) where you are not bothered by her practising or playing, and she is not bothered with getting on your nerves and with you getting on her nerves. It's the teacher's job to correct her, not yours.  A whole lot of things with musical instruments, and very much so with violin, fixes itself over long stretches of times, with occasional supervision/direction provided by a teacher and prioritised to what a child can be expected to focus on.  Your daughter does not profit from your meddling: she cannot heed everything at once.  Violin is a brutally hard instrument where you need to be in control of a lot of variables, and the way to do that is keep doing it.  Your interference does not help and makes your child feel inadequate.  Rely on the teacher to provide guidance and evaluation."
"Why are measures (aka ""bars"") important?","First, I think that it would be difficult to read a piece of music with no bar lines. The bar lines help to break longer streams of notes into regularized and easily digestible chunks. But it is also not true that a stream of 16 quarter notes should represent the same thing as four bars of four quarter notes. For example, typically in 4/4 time the One and the Three get accented, but not the Two and the Four; but of the One and the Three, the One gets a slightly stronger accent. On the other hand, in 2/4 time the One gets accented, but not the Two. All Ones receive the same accent, and all the strong beats receive the same accent. Here the feel is different from 4/4 time. A similar thing happens with 3/4 time compared with 6/8 time. In 3/4 time the One gets the accent, and in 6/8 time the One and the Four get the accents, with the One receiving slightly more emphasis. This means that 3/4 time and 6/8 time have different rhythmic feels. So bar lines convey some information about rhythmic feel as well as helping to organize notes into easily digestible chunks. Maybe you could preserve time signatures and rhythmic feel without bar lines, but it would be very difficult to read rhythms this way. Additionally, music tends to have a regular underlying pulse. Musical phrases are played against this pulse. Sometimes the same phrase is placed differently in different passages, or even within the same passage, of the same piece of music. The result is that the same phrase can sound different when played in different locations with respect to the pulse. Players are usually very sensitive to this when performing; jazz players often talk about ""playing across bar lines"" or will play the same phrase starting on different beats or subdivisions. All of this is really about sound and feel. Bar lines provide a way to represent the regular pulse of the music so that the ways in which phrases fit around it can be more easily seen in written music. In the end, bar lines are really a notational device."
"Is ""You shouldn't play all 6 strings together on an electric guitar"" good teaching?","The direct answer: No, this is not good teaching There is very little difference between electric and acoustic guitar. Playing all 6 strings can be absolutely fine on either. Many barre chords are 6 string. The question should really be ""...shouldn't play all 6 strings together when using distortion"" When you use distortion you add in harmonics which generally act to muddy the sound, and if you choose the wrong notes you can end up with horrible discordant sounds. That said, many bands use distortion perfectly well with barre chords, and even open chords, using the distortion to add acoustic textures."
Sites with a good selection of sheet music,IMSLP/Petrucci Music Library is free and quite well-furnished.
Why do tube-based guitar amplifiers sound so good?,"As ZombieSheep explained, there are real technological reasons for it. The common terms for the phenomena he describes are: A tube (valve for you Brits) approaching or exceeding its maximum signal level creates distortion, a highly sought after effect in some circles. A solid state or digital circuit approaching or exceeding its maximum signal level creates clipping, a horrible sound that most people hate. Tube amplifiers also create more and / or more pleasing harmonics than do solid state ones. There is an important caveat to this discussion, which keeps the situation from being as simple as tube=good, solid-state=bad: The way that tubes break up (distort) is well understood and many modern solid-state amplifiers do a very good job of impersonating it in a durable, affordable package. Also, amplifiers may combine other techniques such as digital modeling or the inclusion of a tube in the pre-amp stage to provide good distortion and harmonic richness. EDIT: In addition, I should have noted that solid state amps are capable of creating powerful clean tones that tubes have trouble with because of their tendency to distort when driven hard. The most notable example is probably the Roland Jazz Chorus Wikipedia"
Why you need a rest here in this score? [duplicate],"It prevents the appearance of an overfull measure. Without it, what we see on this staff is a quarter-note chord, a half-note chord, and a quarter-note chord. 1/4 + 1/2 = 3/4, and we're in the time signature 3/4, so the measure should be done already. Then where does that quarter-note chord on the third beat come from? It comes from another voice, as Todd Wilcox says — a voice that's silent on the second beat. By writing a quarter-rest for that voice on the second beat, and writing it on the staff where it's about to have some notes, we properly set up, in advance, when that chord takes place. Yes, the quarter-note duration already exists on the upper staff, but that's a long long way away. The rest establishes that information locally, on the lower staff, to improve clarity."
"Are sharp keys ""bright"" and flat keys ""dark""?","It certainly holds some truth, irrespective of tuning system, in the following sense: modulating to a key with more sharps evokes a “bright” sensation; modulating to more flat evokes a “dark” sensation. This is somewhat tangible: raising accidentals are likely to be perceived as “uplifting”.
(Except when they're not; perception is of course highly subjective and often culturally influenced.)

Now, a key with many sharps is more likely to have been reached by modulation from a flatter key, than from one with even more sharps. In this sense, a key with sharps is statistically more likely to appear bright. Whether this has any relevance to pop music is doubtful. Pop doesn't tend to modulate much at all, except for the last repetition of the chorus... almost always up, although if you raise the entire key by a half-tone it may well be notated with five flats instead of the seven sharps you'd need. Other thoughts: different keys are differently well-suited for various instruments. Of course this too can't be more than a rule of thumb, but there does appear to be some trend that brighter instruments are more comfortable with sharper keys. This may also contribute to a perception that compositions / passages in flat keys sound darker: because they feature dark instruments more prominently!"
Learn piano one hand at a time or simultaneously?,"The mantra in learning piano is: ""start slowly."" How slow is slow? So slow you are unable to make mistakes, and then a little slower than that. 
Invariably when I have to choose a speed at which I think I can't make a mistake, at first I think: ""come on, this is ridiculous!, of course I can't make a mistake""... and then I make a mistake. As for the specific problem of hand coördination:
In the very beginning it helped me to practice away from the piano at first with my hands on my knees. For every note in my left hand I slapped my hand on my left knee and vice versa. When I could do that, I played the right hand on the piano and simultaneously moved my left hand in the air (or slapped it on my knee). After that I switched roles. The next step was playing with both hands at the same time, slowly. After several weeks this kind of exercise wasn't needed anymore, but in the beginning I found it helpful to 'rewire my brain' so to speak. Concerning hands separate versus hands together: For any piece 'at your level' beginning with practising hands separate is needed. It's being used to tackle problems of reading, fingering, dynamics,..., before adding the extra complexity of having two hands to control. But what I experience is that playing hands together after having practiced hands separate can feel as starting completely over. What I mean is that passages that were comfortable hands separate, are feeling clumsy again when starting hands together. Sometimes it is like having to learn the piece all over again. So the need to start slowly (and even slower than that) is there again but now hands together. 
Because of that in my experience it is not efficient to practice towards 'perfection' hands separate before beginning hands together. Of course the process of practicing hands together is greatly shortened (or even possible), because of the knowledge you gained from the practice hands separate, and that's what I use it for: orientation, experimentation and planning. But really learning the piece only starts with hands together."
Which fingering to use when playing the same piano key twice in a row?,"If you would like to see a tour de force in the use of repeated notes, have a look at Martha Argerich's performance of Scarlatti's D Minor Sonata: 

  You will notice that she uses 321321 for the rapid notes.  Since the accents fall on the first, third and fifth notes, you will see that a different finger is used for each accented note.  As such, she isn't doing this because each finger has a different tone quality--it's safe to assume that she doesn't want the tone quality to vary on each note.  (Tone quality differences are more noticeable in slower, more melodic passages.)  Rather, it's because she can play the notes a lot faster with three fingers than one.  Also, because there are six repeated notes in each group, she can keep playing 321 over and over again so the fingering is quick to learn.  (Getting them even is the tough part!)   The reasons you can play quicker with three fingers than one are simple biomechanics: with three fingers, one finger can be on the way down while another is on the way up, and each muscle has three times as much time to recover before it needs to fire again as it would have when using one finger. I might mention that I play this piece (maybe half as fast and with quite a few more wrong notes) myself, and there's no way I could begin to do it with using the same finger twice in a row on the repeated notes."
What are the ergonomic / playing differences between the guitar and the piano?,"All of your points are good; one of the reasons guitar became so popular in western culture in the early days, is because its portable.    So it's sort of a travelling minstrel's piano.  During the late 19th/early20th centuries in America(post emancipation act), there were lots of travelling musicians who couldn't afford a piano; and even if they could, they couldn't have carried one since most of their travelling was done on foot, they would literally play for a couple of meals and a night under a roof.  These are the guys that brought us the earliest forms of blues, like the Delta blues; which were basically the old slave work songs Blues'd up (call and response etc.). If you scout around you can find old photos of these guys with the most battered looking old instruments you can imagine. However you want to look at it (poor man's piano/portable piano), the portability and relative cheapness (guys would knock them together out of bits of random wood), is a major difference which helped start the wheel of popular music/culture rolling. Another practical one is that the piano has pedals which can help the player control various aspects of the sound (sustain/velocity/etc.)."
"""one finger per fret"" - is it worth following this rule?","Finger per fret is widely used; and is used by some of the most technical rock/contemporary players in the world. Paul Gilbert
Joe Stump
Steve Vai
John Petrucci All use their pinkies in this way;  Use of the little finger simply offers you more note options on the neck; giving you a wider reach without needing to shift hand position. The more flexible your hands the more each finger can do; the most experienced players often cover 4+ frets with the first three fingers; using the little finger for the far stretches when neccesary. In the end it comes down to how you feel comfortable; I have found that almost everyone I have advised 'finger per fret' to has seen a massive improvement in their playing and their abilities to remember scale/arpeggio positions/patterns on the neck. That said; it should only ever be the base technique of your fingering; you will need to alter/adjust fingering for many things. "
Do musicians that began playing from an early age have an incontestable advantage?,"I'm reminded of what my mother once told me. Music is not competition. Leave the racing to the horses. Having taught children myself and having lived in a house of teachers for 22 years I can tell you sometimes it is refreshing to be able to talk to your pupil like an adult. You are constantly running the proverbial mine field when trying to teach children. Begging, pleading and the occasional yelling is all part and parcel of getting often lazy children to do what it takes to become good at music. So in the end if you are a grownup and listen to your teachers and put the hours in you can become perfectly proficient musician in a lot less time and effort than which is the case most of the time with children. I believe that the attitude and work ethic is much more vital to your success in life and in music than when exactly you started training. That being said there is off course those who began early, listen to their teachers and work extraordinarily hard at perfecting their craft. Those are usually the ones that you hear about."
How do I stop muting nearby strings or will my fingers reshape after some practice?,"You're not going to mutate significantly. In time, you'll learn to place your fingers more precisely. In some cases, this might mean placing the finger to one side rather than in the middle, because you might not need to worry about fouling the string on one side (e.g. if you're fretting it higher) Another important thing is to put your fingers close to the fret you're playing. This allows you to press down less hard, which makes the fingers 'squish' less. You'll also get better at feeling and hearing when you're accidentally muting a string, and be able to correct faster with less conscious thought - so your mistakes will matter less. You'll also anticipate where you need to put your fingers further into the future, which will help you make fewer mistakes. Sometimes I even have to 'cheat' a little by bending one string a little away from a potentially interfering finger! It takes a little time to get the co-ordination to do this. Having said all that, you may well find that your fingers harden up a little, which may help you press a little less hard (which again avoids some of the squishing). It's probably only a tiny effect, but all these factors add up."
Chord naming conventions: add2 versus add9,"Having been a professional music educator, copyist and performer for over 40 years, I see some issues that are based on the habit of mixing ""pop lead sheet"" theory and knowing the actual spellings of chords. Too many times, writers try to dumb-down chord spellings to make them easy for novices to understand. Not meant as condescending statement, but there are many books aimed at the novice that attempt to explain chord structures simply, but those chord books wind up giving the impression that they accurately display how the chords are to be structured. I guess the reason is that novices can learn Em7 and then they learn to lower the 5th. But this teaching method of chord spelling actually prevents students from ever learning the difference between major, minor, diminished, augmented, suspended basic chord structures and qualities. Not to mention, means that quartal and other harmonies are never even approached. Most people would agree that an Em triad is not to be written E(b3) because most people are taught the difference between major and minor structures. Why not also teach augmented and half-diminished structures instead of considering them being variants of major and minor (G7#5 and Gø7 respectively) ?   "
How to dramatically change the feeling of a song while keeping the melody largely the same?,"There are some very simple ways to transform the mood of a song by slight alterations in the melody, harmony or both.   A transposition of the melody to the relative minor (ex. from C major to A minor) or to the parallel minor (ex. from C major to C minor) are both very simple ways to retain the melodic material, while drastically changing the sound.   There is a fun piece by Mozart, 12 Variations on ""Ah, vous dirai-je, maman"" KV 265 that exemplifies this concept.  The melody is ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.""  On the eighth variation he transposes to the parallel minor.  If you listen through all of the extra embellishments Mozart adds, you find the simple theme.   When using the relative minor, one could simply change the harmony and leave the melody completely intact.  Take Amazing Grace for example.  If you were playing the song in G major, one would generally harmonize with I, IV, and V (G major, C major, and D major)  Instead, use the i, iv, and v in the appropriate places from the relative minor (E minor, A minor and B minor.) Creative and clever writing can go a long way with what you are talking about.  In general, if you keep the rhythmic and intervallic identity of the original melody in tact, you will reap positive results."
How do professional electronic musicians/sound engineers combat listening fatigue?,"One of the most common pieces of advice I hear about this is to take breaks. You're right that in some situations (extremely tight deadlines, for example) this may not be practical, but in reality, it's the best way to achieve the results you hope for. Listening fatigue is a real thing, and the phenomenon you describe, coming back to a song you liked only to discover it's awful, is very common. It's so common, in fact, that I often hear advice stressing to leave the project for days, not just hours, and come back to listen to it again with ""fresh ears."""
What tools should every guitarist have?,"A good multi-tool, like one by Leatherman, is a nice addition to your case. They include slot and phillips head screwdrivers, pliers, diagonal cutters (good for emergency wire stripping), a file (useful for fingernails). In addition, I throw in a small set of real diagonal cutters for changing strings, because they work more easily than the one on the multi-tool. It's surprising how strong strings can be and these will make short work of cutting the string after you've detuned it until its slack. Finally, I keep a small socket driver sized to fit 1/4"" jacks on effects and guitars and amps, because, sure as shooting, they'll loosen. A small bar towel is good for wiping off sweat and grime; Sometimes we get rushed during set up and don't get a good chance to cool off, so you can drape that over the upper bout of the guitar to keep a sweaty forearm off the finish. Sweat soaks in fast and takes a lot of work to get out so its better to avoid it. Towels also come in handy when you drop an amp on your finger, spill water, soda, beer, etc. Just toss it in the laundry and throw a clean one back in the case. In addition, one or two small micro-cloths can help for touchups, especially if they have a bit of carnuba wax (or whatever sort of wax you use.) My final thing is personal choice - I keep all my picks in an Altoids tin. In the old days it would'a been a Sucrets throat-lozenge box. "
Do guitar strings wear when not used?,It depends on how you keep the guitar; the higher the humidity the more likely the strings are get get rusty and tarnish; in fact the whole guitar needs extra care in those conditions; good rule of thumb is if the guitar is not to be used keep it in a dry place at room temperature in a case if possible. If you keep the guitar in good conditions the strings will take years to wear out if not played.
"How to do ""metal"" harmonics (pinch etc)","(Just in case of any confusion, this answer was originally in response to a duplicate question about pinch harmonics used by Billy Gibbons of ZZTop - thanks for the merge, Dr Mayhem!) These are probably pinch harmonics. In which case, they are not produced by a particular amp or effects setting, but are produced by the picking hand while playing (although they are much easier to produce when using a lot of overdrive/distortion). Pinch harmonics are produced by creating a node with the picking hand as it picks, rather than creating a node above one of the frets (eg. 12, 9, 7, 5) with the fretting hand, which are natural harmonics. (See the end of this post, for an explanation of what nodes are and how to find and create them.) There are several ways to do this. Most players do pinch harmonics using the thumb of the picking hand; I touch lightly with the nail of my ring finger (3rd) on my picking hand. Either way, the thumb or finger should touch at exactly the same time as the pick and then move away from the string at the same time as the pick. You will need to experiment with moving your pick position along the string, to find different node positions for different pitches (and, of course, these change, depending upon which fret your L.H. is fretting). Like many players, I suspect, I first ""discovered"" pinch harmonics by accident (usually while using distortion). With a bit of practice, though, it becomes easy to create pinch harmonics for any fretted note. I must confess, I take a rather ""non-scientific"" approach to pinch harmonics, being able to find them somewhat intuitively. However, there are plenty of guitarists who know exactly where to create the R.H. node to create exactly the harmonics they want for any particular fretted note. Another term for harmonics created when playing fretted notes is artificial harmonics. In particular, this term is used when playing classical guitar. Obviously, no pick is used for classical guitar, so the method of production is different. The node is created by the R.H. index finger; the string is then usually played with the R.H. ring finger. (Although, this may need to be different if playing chords containing an artificial harmonic.) When producing these kind of artificial harmonics on classical guitar a hit-and-miss approach is not useful; the R.H. index finger needs to be placed exactly at the node point on the string (usually half the length of the fretted string, to produce a harmonic an octave higher than the fretted note, although other harmonics can be effectively produced too). The lack of distortion and volume when playing classical guitar means that only ""exact"" harmonics sound effectively, whereas, with plenty of volume and distortion, pinch harmonics can almost be produced accidentally as a kind of ""effect"" when playing electric guitar. ADDITIONAL INFO: What are nodes? How do I find and create them, to produce harmonics? As requested, here is some additional info about finding node points on strings to create harmonics. Node points for harmonics can be found at points along a string by dividing the total length by an integer (whole number) value. For instance, there is a node point at 1/2 way along the string (in other words, it is found by dividing the total length by 2). Dividing the total string length by 3 gives two node points, producing the same harmonic; one is a 1/3 of the string length from the nut, the other is a 1/3 of the string length from the bridge. If a vibrating string is touched at a node point (while or after it is plucked) the string vibrates ""in sections"", with the node point (and other equal node points) being still. This creates a harmonic, a higher pitched overtone, present in the open or fretted pitch (the fundamental frequency). The pitch of the harmonic is directly related to the integer value of the string division. For instance, playing the harmonic with a node at the halfway point along the string doubles the frequency, which makes it an octave higher. If the node point is found by dividing the string length by 3, the frequency is 3 times the fundamental frequency, which makes it an octave and a fifth higher. The wikipedia article here gives a good, detailed explanation (and illustration) of how strings vibrate when touched at these different node points, and how this affects the frequency of the harmonics produced. How does this relate to playing pinch/artificial harmonics on guitar? When playing an artificial or pinch harmonic, the node points are now a division of the fretted length of the string; in other words, the distance between the bridge and the fret being pressed with the fretting hand. If using the R.H. thumb to play pinch harmonics, the point of the thumb closest to the string (usually the left side of the thumb's tip), touches the string at a node point, at the same time as the pick touches the string. The pick will be plucking the string slightly to the right of where the thumb touches the string. The images at this webpage illustrate this well. If using a R.H. finger to play pinch harmonics, it's tip (or nail) will again touch at a harmonic node-point, but the pick will now be plucking to the left of where the finger touches the string. I use my R.H. ring finger to do this, but it is possible to use the index, middle or little fingers, too. To produce artificial harmonics on classical guitar, the R.H. index finger usually touches the node point (by ""pointing"" somewhat towards the neck), while the R.H. ring finger plucks the string. The image below illustrates this well:  EDIT: one last point. The technique of using the ring finger to pluck the string is helpful on classical guitar, as it means you pluck the string some distance from where you touch the node. As classical guitar is acoustic (and so, obviously, doesn't use distortion either!) it is harder to produce a strong harmonic. Plucking further from the node helps to do this. I illustrate this in my answer to another question, here. "
Do different synthesizers have different timbres and/or produce different harmonics for the same given waveform?,"They are not identical. The differences are suble, but often audible. Different implementations of both oscillators and specific waveforms will yield slightly different timbres. The rest of the signal path also plays a role, like amps overdriving, and filters adding character themselves (some filters can't be completely bypassed, even when the knob is turned all the way open!). Here are some examples of sawtooths from different software synths with the filters completely open or bypassed when possible, and with the signal path as clean as the synth allowed. Arturia Minimoog:  NI Absynth:  GForce Minimonsta:  Waves Element:  LennarDigital Sylenth1:  They are all different. Arturia Minimoog and Minimonsta label themselves as ""virual analog"", and seems that they are using sawtooths similar to what we find in analog synths. According to this article the Minimonsta's sawtooth is almost identical to the Minimoog Voyager's. Waves Element is another virtual analog synth, but it has a different and weird sawtooth, probably modeled around another analog synth."
What is the difference between mono and stereo?,"The difference is in the number of channels (signals) used. Mono uses one, stereo uses more than one. In monaural sound one single channel is used. It can be reproduced through several speakers, but all speakers are still reproducing the same copy of the signal.  In stereophonic sound more channels are used (typically two). You can use two different channels and make one feed one speaker and the second channel feed a second speaker (which is the most common stereo setup). This is used to create directionality, perspective, space.  Here is an example using a two speaker setup. Mono  Stereo  More technically, true stereo means sound recording and sound reproduction that uses stereographic projection to encode the relative positions of objects and events recorded. In a common stereo setup of two channels: left and right, one channel is sent to the left speaker and the other channel is sent to the right speaker. Now, by controlling to which channel you send the signal you can control the position of the sound. You'll hear sounds coming from different directions depending on which speaker you send the signal to, or in which proportion (you can send just a little more to the right speaker, so the sound is positioned just a little bit to the right). Sounds with equal proportions on both speakers will appear to come from the center. In other words, stereo opens the possibility of playing with sound localization."
What is the difference between Overdrive and Distortion?,"From a sound design / sound engineer context As an effect, distortion is any process that alters the sound in the harmonic (tone, timbre) domain.  Overdrive is a type of distortion. It is achieved by saturating (overdriving) the valves in an amplifier (or a simulation of this dynamic).  In that context, overdrive is a subset of distortion. From a guitar effect / pedal context From this page: So what is the difference between a distortion and an overdrive? To put it simply, an overdrive pedal aims at simulating the creamy sound of an overdriven tube amp whereas a distortion does not try to simulate reality and usually offers more gain and is more aggressive. From the Wikipedia distortion page: The terms ""distortion"", ""overdrive"" and ""fuzz"" are often used interchangeably, but they have subtle differences in meaning. Overdrive effects are the mildest of the three, producing ""warm"" overtones at quieter volumes and harsher distortion as gain is increased. A ""distortion"" effect produces approximately the same amount of distortion at any volume, and its sound alterations are much more pronounced and intense. A fuzzbox (or ""fuzz box”) alters an audio signal until it is nearly a square wave and adds complex overtones by way of a frequency multiplier. What is the difference in tone, harmonics, etc.? Are they the same? Which one is better and for what? The difference is in the distortion amount. Overdrive generates less amount of tone change than distortion. Distortion generates more harmonics and/or the generated harmonics will have more amplitude than overdrive. Overdrive will be better if you want a cleaner sound, and distortion will be better if you want a more distorted sound.  We can test this by applying both effects to a sine wave and comparing the results. For these tests, I'll use the highest amount of effect possible for each device. These pics show the device's settings, followed by the harmonic content it induced in the sine wave. Logic's Overdrive:

"Difference between ""Bar"" and ""Measure""","I've studied music in both the US and the UK (piano lessons in the UK at age 14, majored in piano in the US), and bar and measure are used interchangeably in both in my experience.  Jazz and blues musicians tend to say ""bar"" more often than ""measure"": 12-bar and 16-bar blues, for example.  Also, you'd never hear a jazz musician say ""He stepped on four of my measures"" if someone came in four bars early while he was improvising for an allotted number of bars.  Nevertheless, they mean the same thing, both in the US and the UK."
How many (major and minor) keys are there? Why?,"Obviously the answer depends on your point of view, and there probably isn't one ""right"" answer. There are 12 unique named tones in Western music; all pitches are one of these 12 tones. Thus, from a purely sonic perspective, there are only twelve starting notes for a key, and with major and minor scale qualities, there are 24 tonally unique keys. For my part, this is my answer; it's the basis of the Circle of Fifths and thus much of Western music theory. Now, those 12 tones don't each have unique names; each flat note is the adjacent note's sharp (for F and C, their flats are the natural notes E and B) and vice versa. For most of these, such as A#, you have to go more than halfway around the Circle of Fifths, and ""double-sharp"" or ""double-flat"" notes in the key signature. Double-sharping and double-flatting is generally frowned on, and is disallowed altogether in key signatures because key signatures are supposed to have only one symbol.  Also, in these cases there is a key signature available with far fewer accidentals (A# would require double-sharping F,C, and G, but why have 4 sharps and three double-sharps, when all you need is two flats?) However, for three of these enharmonic note names (B/Cb, F#/Gb, and C#/Db), a key signature exists that has 7 or fewer sharps or flats, thus not requiring mixed symbols. If we consider major and minor variants of these to be separate nameable keys, there are 30 nameable (engravable) keys that you could conceivably see on a piece of music using the Westen notation system. 6 of them are enharmonic, and four (two key signatures/major-minor pairs) are unlikely to be seen as their enharmonic equivalent alters fewer notes (C# requires seven sharps; Db only requires five flats), but the signatures conform to the notation rules either way. Virtually all your other possible systems violate the generally-accepted notation standards for Western sheet music (primarily by unnecessarily double-flatting or double-sharping notes). These rules evolved out of a general desire to simplify and standardize notation based on logical symbolic progressions, which also generally followed the math behind the sounds of Western music. There isn't one single person who set them in stone (and indeed many things we consider ""rules"" can be bent and broken to great effect), but I'll bet that if you handed any professional musician a piece written in A# he'd scratch out all those symbols and write in two flats, and curse your name for wasting his time."
How do you remember your music and how do I improve in this regard?,"Musical memory comes in two flavours: unconscious (muscle) memory and conscious (mental) memory. Muscle memory comes with repetition and can prove to be surprisingly long-lasting - provided it has had sufficient reinforcement over time. It's something that gets ingrained every time you play a piece - provided you know it well enough to play it without errors every time. Consicous memory consists in knowing what you are supposed to play in musical terms and being able to play it whenever necessary. Whenever you try to memorise a musical fragment, it will fall in one of two broad categories: a. melodic shape b. standard pattern I'll address standard patterns first, since they provide a form of musical shortcut. A standard pattern is a musical fragment that is common to many compositions and stems from the rules of chord or scale construction. Thus, standard patterns will include chord forms, chord changes, arpeggios, scalar runs, sequences and progressions. Learning standard patterns is a fundamental element of mastering instrumental technique, exactly because they are so commonly used. Melodic shapes, on the other hand, are fragments without a clear construction rule, generally specific to the piece in question. While longer melodic statements may include phrases that have been used in many other pieces, overall, the melody will be piece-specific. In order to develop playing from memory, you should make a directed effort towards memorising your repertoire and playing it from memory. If thus far you have mostly been playing from sheet music, you should begin to incorporate pure memory playing into your practice. Thus, once you have memorised a piece (more on that in a second), you should try to henceforth play it from memory only, when practicing. To develop a conscious memory of the piece, you'll need to analyse its construction in order to identify the standard patterns and melodic shapes that make it up. Don't try to take the whole piece in at once; rather, break down the form into its constituent sections and memorise one at a time. To begin with, note the key, meter and tempo of the section you are studying. Next, look at the harmony and chord progressions - if your knowledge of harmonic theory is lacking, note and memorise the acutual chord names, if you're confident enough to identify the functional relationships, all the better - you can simply apply the memorised functional structure to the key you're playing in and not have to worry about naming each chord. Look at how the harmony is executed: whether it is through chord fragments, arpeggios, repeating patterns etc. and note how the chords change. You should be creating a mental map of the part, with any standard patterns serving as mental signposts. When analysing the melody, be on the lookout for any runs, sequences, repeating patterns - anything that you can conveniently name and commit to memory. Again, the aim is to create mental shortcuts; rather than trying to memorise the melody note-by-note, standard patterns allow you to mark larger fragments with a name and starting note and can then be played from your knowledge of the pattern. Melodic shapes that aren't standard patterns must be memorised note-by-note, but even here you should be looking for characteristic elements that can serve as mental signposts. Be especially aware of any phrase repetitions, directional changes and the like. The key is to think as little in terms of individual notes to be played as possible. Every time you can ""dump"" a group of notes into a collective shape, pattern or progression you are saving mental overhead for memorising the rest of the piece. Naturally, your ability to do this will depend on your knowledge of standard patterns, so it's a good idea to devote some time to studying theory, harmony and fundamental techniques. This will further your understanding of what you are playing and thus make memorisation easier. You'll also probably find it easier to concentrate on one hand at a time so you are consciously aware of what each hand is supposed to be doing at any point. Once you have the individual sections memorised, you'll need to bring them together by memorising the form of the piece. Again, you should be trying to think in terms of mental blocks (the sections you have studied) and be aware of any repetitions. Thus far I've been focusing on the issue of notes (pitches) to be played, but the above also applies to rhythmic values - any time you can identify a repeating rhythmic shape, you can memorise it as a block, rather than thinking in terms of the individual values of each note and rest."
"Why can I easily sing or whistle a tune I've just heard, but not as easily reproduce it on an instrument?","Voice is an 'instrument' that many people learn in almost an ideal way. We start young, and practice with it very frequently - even speaking teaches you how to control the pitch of your voice.  And because it's an instrument that everyone has, almost everyone also learns to sing in various environments, from singing rhymes in nursery school, to singing along in school assemblies or as parts of a sports crowd - not to mention those who learn in a slightly more formal way. Voice is also an instrument we have relatively direct control over. We don't have to worry about things like finger positions - with a moderate amount of practice, most people develop a subconscious mental map of how to control their vocal cords to hit a certain note; it almost becomes like a ""thought-controlled' instrument. Due to the immediacy of control, we can also adjust very quickly, so small mistakes can be corrected less noticeably than with other instruments. Due to all these advantages that being 'built-in' to the body gives, it's true that many - perhaps most - people do have the ability to sing back a tune. However, I think you're underestimating how good professional musicians are at reproducing tunes by ear. As per David Bowling's comment, I'd expect most professional instrumentalists to be able to play back tunes on their instrument by ear with a similar level of accuracy. It may be that they aren't able to do so with quite as little conscious thought as someone can when they are singing, but their experience with mapping heard notes to scales, and their scales to positions on the instrument, will make up for that.  Why do I have to experiment with pitches on an instrument to reproduce a tune by ear? Probably simply because you haven't attained enough experience in reproducing tunes by ear on an instrument! To get good at this you probably need to learn from various angles. One angle would be doing some ear training exercises to help the mapping between the sound and the notion of which note of the scale; another exercise would be to practice scales and arpeggios on the instrument to reinforce the mapping between the concept of the note and the physical finger position. Practicing improvisation will also help to make your playing more instinctive. Even some quite 'passive' exercises - like noodling on the instrument while watching on TV - will help with this."
What does a straight line connecting notes on different clefs mean?,"It means quite simply that the voice in question is moving between the staves (and usually between the hands as well). In this case, the voice starting with G above middle C falls an octave to be continued in the left hand until it returns to G below middle C, then rises back up an octave to be played in the right hand. Edit: Here is the original score of this passage (m.10ff of the Ricercar a 6 from the Musical Offering). Looking at the range of the individual voices, you can well imagine the number of times voices will cross between staves when this is transcribed to a Grand Staff. "
What is the difference between equivalent Flat and Sharp keys as far as musical notation? Are there any reasons to prefer one over the other?,"C♯ and D♭ are enharmonically the same. This means that they are played by the same key on a piano, but they have a different musical meaning and they actually should sound a tiny bit different (although the difference is minimal). However, string or woodwind instruments might be able to play them slightly differently and thus correctly. In Pythagorean tuning, each semitone consists of 100 cents on average. C♯ and D♭ actually differ 41 cents from each other. This stems from the fact that the tuning is defined by going through the circle of fifths with a ratio of 3:2 (see table here). The interested reader can refer to the fantastic book ""Music: a Mathematical Offering"" by Dave Benson, available for free at the original University of Aberdeen site or here at Penn Uni. To answer your question in practice: usually the key with fewest signs is used :)"
How do I connect my musical instrument to a computer?,"Acoustic instruments, of course, don't have any kind of electrical audio output. For these you need a microphone. For the purposes of this answer, a microphone is just another instrument. Electric instruments have a socket in them through which an audio signal is output. There are various kinds of connector: 3.5mm phone – the same form as an iPod headphone plug:  1/4"" phone – a guitar plug, or its stereo equivalent:  phono – as used to connect hi-fi components to each other:  XLR – the standard for professional microphones, and for carrying analogue audio over long cable runs:  Line level can be thought of as a ""standard loudness"" that audio devices are designed to send and receive. If you plugged a pair of headphones directly into a line-level signal, you'd hear music – probably louder than you'd normally play it. Instruments such as keyboards output a line level signal, as do devices such as hi-fi components. Some guitar multi-fx pedals output line level. You can generally use a headphone output, with the volume turned up, as a line level substitute. Instrument level and microphone level are the signal levels coming out of instrument pickups and microphones. These are much, much lower signals than line level. If you plugged a pair of headphones directly into an instrument level signal, you wouldn't hear anything. In order to make use of an instrument level signal, you must plug it into an input designed to accept that quiet signal. Sometimes you will have such an input. If not, you can use a pre-amplifier (""pre-amp"") to bring the signal up to line level.  Illustrated is a reasonable expensive pre-amp designed for taking microphone signals to line level. Pre-amps vary from kits you can buy for a few dollars from electronic hobbyist shops, to outrageously expensive devices for superstitious audiophiles/musos. Most computers have a built in audio interface. The illustration shows the layout you'd typically see on the back of a desktop PC - but Macs and laptops usually have something similar.  Microphone and instrument-level sources should be plugged into the microphone socket. Line level sources should be plugged into the line-in socket. Built-in sound cards usually use 3.5mm stereo phone connectors. Whatever shape your instrument's output socket is, it will be possible to get adapters or converter cables to connect them to this input. Some computers have a line-in input and no microphone socket. This can be overcome using a pre-amp. Some computers have a mic socket and no line in. This can be overcome by turning the output volume down, but audio quality can suffer badly. Some computers have settings in the audio driver configuration, to switch the socket from line-in mode to microphone mode. Built in audio inputs are usually of adequate quality for music playback, games and telephony. Some audiophiles and musicians find them inadequate. As well as subjectively poor sound quality, latency becomes a problem to the musician. Desktop users can install higher quality sound cards. If your computer does not have mic/line-in sockets, or if you are not satisfied with the quality of your built-in sound interface, or if you require more than one input, then you can add an external audio interface. External audio interfaces are usually connected by USB. Firewire was also used in the past.  External devices range from cheap and simple devices such as the Rocksmith guitar interface and the Griffin iMic, to studio devices with multiple inputs, high-end electronics, control knobs and indicators. See How necessary is an USB Audio Interface? for a discussion about the necessity for one of these. Now that your instrument is plugged into your computer, what can you do with it?"
Boiling/washing used guitar/bass strings - is it worthwhile?,"It's a trick that's been around for ages, with many variations - I've even heard that the use of certain bodily fluids gives good results, but it isn't something I'm about to try. The main reason to do this is to save money, but you should ask yourself whether the savings are worth it. It's generally a better idea to keep your strings in good shape - wiping them clean of grime and sweat after playing and giving them a rubdown with string-cleaner every now and again. Boiling is a short-term remedy and if you've been taking care of your strings on a regular basis, by the time it becomes an option, you really should think about changing them. The key drawback of boiling is that you must take the strings off and put them on again - which, unfortunately, exposes them to certain risks. For a start, once they've been wound onto the tuning pegs, the wire is permanently disfigured. This isn't a problem as long as they remain wound on, but removing them and putting them back on may make it a factor in tuning, consistent string vibration and overall strength - bend and straighten a wire too many times and it breaks. You can take care in putting the strings back on again in order to achieve an near-identical string position as originally, however, it's likely that you will end up with some inconsistency. String tension will take care of it to an extent, but the string won't perform as well as when it was originally put on. With wound strings, an additional problem might be distortion of the windings for the exact same reason. My suggestion would be to resort to boiling only when left with no other option. It really shouldn't be seen as a standard method of extending string life. "
Has music notation become more prescriptive?,"What a great question! From an early historical standpoint, I can think of several cases where this has happened. I'd be interested in more answers, and especially later historical examples. In the Middle Ages and Renaissance, accidentals were often not notated, with the composer relying on the performer's knowledge of musica ficta to provide the correct pitches. Ornaments were also not typically notated, and were left to the performer's taste; there are treatises from the time (e.g. Silvestro Ganassi's Opera intitulata Fontegara) on how to tastefully improvise ornaments and other elaborations (called divisions). Starting in the Baroque era, there was an increasing trend to write out at least partly ornamented lines (though much was still left to taste). However, articulations and dynamics, while occasionally indicated when important, were often left unmarked. On the other hand, there was also the creation of basso continuo, which took a relatively non-prescriptive, improvisatory approach to accompaniment. Beethoven was one of the first composers to specify precise tempos in terms of metronome beats (e.g. =120), rather than a general feeling (e.g. Allegro, Andante...). Edit: I think Jazz probably provides a good modern counter-example, where there is an incredibly non-prescriptive notation. You might be given a lead sheet with chord symbols, and expected to decorate the melody line, substitute chords, and improvise various fills and counter-melodies on the fly."
"Why is a 440 Hz frequency considered the ""standard"" pitch for musical instruments?","440 Hz is the standard that has been adopted. Before it was, an instrument tuned in one country or even city was out of tune in another; confusion reigned. The short version of it is that countries got together in a conference and agreed on using 440 Hz as a standard. Bach tuned at 415 Hz, which was the standard in those days and is still used by many orchestras for that reason. Some say that you should tune at 432 Hz as it's the frequency of the earth, but this has been debunked, and I will not get into that here. It still makes for an interesting reflection. There is even a conspiracy theory involving the Nazis about 440 Hz. So if you tune to a different frequency it's fine, but when you play with others that are tuned at 440 Hz you'll sound off. For the whole story on 440 Hz and an interesting article, see this article."
Examples of songs or phrases played in different temperaments,"Here are links to YouTube videos, all three of which were posted by the same person, using the same synthesizer, all three playing Bach's Air on the G String.  But each link uses a different tuning system:"
What does play with feeling mean?,"So my only conclusion is that they didn't want me to play what was on the page.  Correct.  Standard notation is very flexible, but it often only allows for an approximation of how the piece might be expected to sound. What you may need to do is put in very slight timing and dynamics variations that, if notated accurately, would make the page a hideous mess of tied notes and accent markings.  Try to work out what genre/style the piece is (or what styles it alludes to), and listen to renditions of pieces in that style to work out exactly how the notes are being subtly shifted and accented. Some styles might need you to slightly delay the eighths or sixteenths. Some styles might require you to accent different beats in a way that isn't obvious from the time signature. Some styles might require some sections to be played in quite free time, getting away from the 'grid' implied by the time signature. Or you might have a slightly extended rest between phrases. And so on and so forth.  You're right, of course, that ""play with feeling"" on its own doesn't give you enough information to tell you what to do. You need to be familiar with the style in order to understand what's expected and appropriate. To an extent, this is where the 'feeling' comes in - if you enjoy and are 'into' a style, you're more likely to understand exactly what timing and accenting variations are right for the style.  But when it comes down to it, it's not really about 'feeling' at all. A good session musician will be able to look at a part that they think is thoroughly boring, and still play it 'with feeling' - because they understand the style. "
What modern innovations have been/are being made for the piano?,"(1) A variation on the player piano is the Speaking Piano: YouTube: Speaking Piano
(NOTE: Video narration is in German, but the piano ""speaks"" in English.) This is the 2009 work of Peter Ablinger. He processed speech audio using Fast Fourier Transforms, effectively splitting the audio into 88 frequency bands, assigning each frequency to its own piano key. The MIDI data produced by this method is 'performed' by a mechanical device that has a separate actuator for each piano key. (2) The infinite sustain grand piano uses electromagnetic coils beneath the strings to sustain the notes without decaying to silence. Also, notes can be started without the piano hammer, so the note swells from silence. This is a similar principle to the e-bow used by guitarists to infinitely sustain their notes.

This means the piano strings must be much longer than they would be for wound strings. YouTube: Tall Piano"
"To what extent is music theory just giving us a language to describe/break down music, or does it really have significant ""scientific content""?","It doesn't seem... that ""music theory predicts what is good music"" I agree. And why would it? That's not what theories are there for at all. Like, the theory of Newtonian mechanics isn't there for judging what kind of behaviour of stuff in the real world is good behaviour or bad behaviour – that's not for physicists to judge, the world is just as it is. Likewise, music is just how it is, regardless of whether it conforms to some particular theoretical framework. However, that's almost completely orthogonal to It doesn't seem to have significant ""scientific content"" Hardly anybody is going to dispute that Newtonian mechanics has significant scientific content. It is enormoursly valuable, even though it's not always right. Why? Because it Newtonian theory is not “the” theory of physics, it is one physical theory. Unfortunately, by contrast, the term “music theory” is often used synonymously with common practice, or even “the harmonic style of 18th century european musicians”. That is a musical theory, one which I personally think is extremely useful much like Newtonian theory is a very useful physical theory, but it most definitely isn't the theory to end all theories. In fact, right now there is a lot of discussion about this, captured in Adam Neely's excellent video: 

 The term music theory should really get divorced from its singular focus on common practice. But when people use this to argue that music theory as a whole is obselete, I have to disagree strongly. On the contrary, music theory is an amazing tool to guide us into future musical developments, we just need to use it as such. Not as a dogmatic law book to judge already written music against."
Why are the 4th and 7th scale degrees removed from the major scale to make the Pentatonic scale?,"What we call THE pentatonic scale really wasn't created by removing the 4th and 7th notes from a major scale! It pre-dates the major scale. People have sung on pentatonic scales since they lost interest in tetratonic ones! ""The five-note system was already considered archaic by the Greeks in 350 B.C. and [was] employed long before that by the Chinese."" [Pentatonicism in Hungarian Folk Music, Zoltán Kodály, 1917.] The five-note scales Kodály found in Hungarian folk music were anhemitonic (without semitones), but pentatonic scales exist in countless cultures and they often DO include either semitones or intervals roughly similar to equal temperament semitones. Javanese Gamelan orchestras, for example, generally use five-note (Slendro) scales or five-note subsets of the seven-note (Pelog) scale. These tunings certainly include small intervals - sometimes as many as three. I think there may be some truth in the idea that semitone intervals are harder to sing than larger ones. That might account for the appeal of the 'all black notes' type of scale."

Which instrument can a person play with 2 malformed fingers on each hand?,"I don't know what type of music you're considering playing, but consider stepping outside of the piano/guitar realm. Trombone would be perhaps your best choice. A very difficult instrument to learn and master, but it requires only enough fingers to grip the instrument securely. (You could probably get away with a thumb and finger on each hand). The trombone can be used in any type of music; there are great trombonists that specialize in rock music, for example. Classical, jazz, new-age… the possibilities are endless.  Alternatively, if you are dedicated, consider specializing: if you learn to play pedal steel guitar (fewer finger requirements) and perhaps something like accordion, harmonica, etc., you could join a rock band with that skill-set fairly easily. Learn to sing, at least for backups, and you make yourself even more promising. (Again, I don't know what type of music you're looking at). HOWEVER: Don't sell yourself short with only three fingers! Guitar would be tough, since the thumb can't do a whole lot, but with alternative tunings and a lot of practice, you can accomplish a lot. My father lost use of three of his fingers in a table-saw accident. He eventually regained full use of one of them, but had his middle finger amputated, and has no ability to bend his forefinger. (This is all on his left, fretting hand). He primarily plays bass in his bands now, as it's less frustrating for him, but hearing him on guitar, with the help of alternative tunings, it's difficult to tell he's doing it with fewer fingers. As for piano, classical piano is out, I'm afraid. Some people may question that answer, but there are just too many incredible players out there, and the classical world is hesitant to accept anything but perfection (or close to it). However, piano in other styles is an option. Anything that doesn't have specific note requirements would be possible, in my opinion. So, jazz, rock… anything with chord symbols. It would be easier to do than guitar since the thumb is a fully used digit on both hands for the piano. I imagine you could do well if you were dedicated. The biggest thing is to learn (mentally) different styles and theory, etc., to compensate for any impossibilities on the instrument itself. Jazz/rock organ would be a good option; because too many notes muddies the sound, many players play simpler chords with embellishments that would be easier to accomplish and sound really good than with a piano where the sounds are easily distinguished. My best advice is experiment a little bit, and then pick something and throw yourself into it. You can do things you set your mind to, it just might take extra time, effort, or modifications."
Why does the dominant chord contain a flattened 7th?,"Dominant is the fifth chord of a scale. For example in the C Major scale, the G chord is called Dominant. The 7th of G is F natural. So the G7 chord would be G B D F, but if you wanted to have maj7 it would be G B D F#, but the C Major scale does not include F#. The C7 would be in the F Major scale. The key to F Major scale is Bb, and the Dominant chord would be C E G Bb.
(This doesn't mean that you can't play C7 in another scale.) Edit: Now that I re-read my answer, I think I wasn't really clear. In order to find a chord, you need to ascend 3rds from the note you start (for the most common chords). So, in the C Major scale, the G chord, which is Dominant, will be: G (ascending a major 3rd) B (ascending a minor 3rd) D (ascending a minor 3rd) F, making it G B D F. That's the reason the Dominant chord contains a minor seventh."
How do I know when the next note starts in sheet music?,"I can't understand very well note duration notation. No wonder.  The music you're trying to read is objectively incorrect in several ways.  I won't list them all, but as you've noticed the vertical alignment is out of order.  Furthermore, the rhythmic notation does not comply with the meter.  Follow the advice in the comments to get a different copy. I would use the original edition, which you can find (among several others) at IMSLP.  This piece is on page 6 of that edition. You may prefer a modern edition, but you would be well advised to invest in a professionally edited and engraved one. Edit: I see that you've indicated in the comments that this is a guitar arrangement.  If you click ""arrangements and transcriptions"" on the IMSLP page, you'll see that there is an arrangement there of this piece for unaccompanied guitar."
Tapping 3 times on one leg and 4 times on another leg in 4 beats. What is it called and how to do it?,"Polyrhythm. It's good thing to learn to do. 4 against 3 is nice, before that you should normally try 3 against 2. Normally it's hard to do at the start. I had to break it down, splitting the beats. For 3 against 2 you need to split the pattern into 6, for 4 against 3 into 12. I made two grids to show how:  It takes a bit of practice but it is very good for your time feel as a musician to learn to tap these. Normally you use two hands, one doing each line, or a hand and a foot. It helps if you use two ""instruments"" (whatever comes to hand) that have quite different tones. (And soon you'll have people around you saying ""will you stop that tapping"" ...)"
Why does a 97 / 92 key piano exist by Bösendorfer?,"These extended Bösendorfer ranges go back to Busoni's day. He wanted to match the range of pipe organs, as he was making transcriptions of J. S. Bach's organ works at the time."
Why does the Dorian mode on C have two flats?,"'Dorian mode on C' does not mean ""the Dorian scale that you can find among the notes that are available in the major key of C""!
'Dorian mode on C' refers to the Dorian scale, or set of note intervals, that start on the note C, i.e. C is its root or tonic. This set of notes happens to be the same as the ones found in the Bb major key, thus two flats. This is to say, the specific mode gets its name (C, Db, D, ...) from its first -- or root -- note, not from the key who's notes happen to match the set of notes used in this mode. Again:
The Dorian mode on C happens to use the same notes as the Bb major key and thus uses the same key signature. However since C is its root note, or tonic, it is a C Dorian.
This is analogical to that the Mixolydian mode on F uses the same notes as are found in the key of Bb but has F as its root, or to that the Ionian mode on Bb, which has Bb as its root, happens to use the same notes as the Bb major key, etc.
(Or for that matter that the Bb major scale happens to use the notes of the Bb major key. But this is slightly different since this scale got its name from the key. :-) Perhaps these three tables clarifies this for someone: 1) All Dorian modes 2) All modern modes corresponding to the Bb major key
(Note that the number of flats remain the same.) 3) All modern modes on C
(Note that the number of flats/sharps varies.)"
Why is music for strings more likely to be in keys with sharps?,"Sharp-keys are in some ways nicer to play than flat ones. The preference for these keys is perhaps most extreme in folk styles: going through two collections of celtic-style fiddle music[978-1-85720-202-1],[1-871931-04-5], I found the distribution to be this crass: In particular D major is really a great favourite. In fiddle playing, this is also easy to explain: you want to use empty strings much more than in classical music. With more than two ♭s that's simply impossible on the high violin strings, but even for B♭, F, and C major the empty strings occur mostly on thirds. That is problematic, because these notes are the ones you need to do most intonation-adjustment on (upwards for leading notes, down for chords/double stops). In D major OTOH you have the fundamentals of the primary chords on the empty strings, which is perfect for droning etc.; while the thirds are all fingered and can be moved as necessary. Now, empty strings are somewhat shunned in much of classical music, but in particular for solo playing (think the Bach Cello Suites!) they also have quite a significance. These are actually something of a counterexample though, with both Suite IV and V featuring 3 ♭s. However, since it's totally solo, you can much better ""cheat"": instead of adjusting the thirds, you adjust everything around them... Otherwise, it's certainly a bit of a self-fulfilling truth: because the simple tunes are mostly in those keys, those are best practised, hence even advanced players may be a bit more firm in them than in ♭-heavy keys."
"Difference between ""hi"" and ""low"" on amps?","The ""Hi"" input attenuates the input signal, usually by between 10-15dB (about half to a third the original volume). The ""Low"" input will not do this. Different guitars and basses produce widely varying signal levels. This isn't just a passive vs active thing; plug a vintage-voiced Strat into the amp, then a PAF-voiced Les Paul; you'll have to turn the gain down. By contrast, the preamp of your amplifier works best with a signal in a particular range of strength; too hot, and you'll clip the preamp (which is generally not the best sound especially if you want a clean tone). Too low, and subtleties of tone become lost in the amp circuitry's ""noise floor"". The different inputs, or the attenutation switch on a single input, allows you to ""turn down"" a hot guitar with a simple switch instead of involving other elements of the preamp. This has two benefits, both tied to being able to turn the other ""downstream"" controls to higher levels. First, taming a hot signal without an attenuator usually requires turning down the ""Pre Gain"" level. This knob, especially on a tube amp, will become very sensitive; small moves will produce huge volume changes. By attenuating the signal before this point in the circuit, the knob becomes less sensitive to small moves. Second, by allowing controls like the pre-gain to be turned higher, more of the original ""native tones"" of the instrument get into the preamp stage, and the tone and equalization controls have more to work with. Overall, this results in a ""less muddy"" sound, as subtle harmonics and overtones aren't lost in the noise floor of the amp."
Classical music theory notation for chord inversions (figured bass),"Just to expand on Pat's answer, there is a figured bass symbols for all type of inversion including root position.   The picture above shows the complete figured bass symbol and how it will be denoted in analysis. As you can see root position triads and 7th chords have their own complete figured bass symbols, but reduce drastically because how common they are.  The numbers are determined by the interval between the bass note(the lowest note) and the other chord members. So if there was a B in the bass and the chord reduced to a G major in the key of C, the Roman Numeral would be V figured bass would be 6/3 which would reduce to 6 . Only the exact voicing of the bass matters.  The reason why the distinctions are made in analysis is because the bass defines the harmonic progression and different inversions will function differently. For example, a second inversion triad is rather dissonant and has to be approached and resolved correctly in order to sound correct. The figured bass along with the Roman Numeral analysis tells almost everything you need to know about the harmonic progression of a piece.  "
What is the difference between upstrokes and downstrokes while strumming a guitar?,"Upstrokes and downstrokes do sound totally different. Upstrokes are ""lighter"", and you hear the high notes first, and they are hit the hardest, which tend to dominate the sound. Downstrokes are more ""closed"", also hear them referred to as ""meaner"", and the lower notes tend to dominate the sound as they are hit the hardest. For example, the first bar of Wonderwall, is played with 3 downstrokes.  If you play it with 3 upstrokes, it gives the song a strange sounding ""lighter"" feel, which is incorrect."
"Why are clefs associated with reference notes G, F and C?","There is a lot of speculation in other answers, but this question actually has a very specific and exact historical answer, at least regarding the F and C clefs.  To summarize, the basic answer is that Guido of Arezzo decided to use F and C as anchor notes in the early to mid 11th century, mostly to indicate that these notes had a semitone below them.  The G clef was added much later, to provide an anchor note in the higher range. To answer in more depth: What's so special about G, F and C? Who decided to use them and why? The ""who"" is Guido of Arezzo, the person who came up with the musical staff (among other things).  Before Guido, there were symbols called neumes that indicated the general shape of a melody, but there was no way to indicate precisely how high or low a particular note was in relation to the neumes around it.  The best that scribes could do is write some neumes a little higher or lower than others.  But there was no staff, so these neumes are sometimes referred to as in campo aperto (""in an open field"").  (See example here, with neumes written above the words.) Guido proposed a method around the year 1030 to measure precisely where a note was in relation to others: The notes are so arranged, then, that each sound, however often it may
  be repeated in a melody, is found always in its own row.  And in order
  that you may better distinguish these rows, lines are drawn close
  together [...].  All the sounds on one line or in one space sound
  alike.  And in order that you may understand to which lines or spaces
  each sound belongs, certain letters of the monochord are written at
  the beginning of lines or spaces.1 Those ""certain letters of the monochord"" meant the note names A, B, C, D, E, F, G.  Actually, B came in two varieties at this time: hard b or square b which we now call B-natural, and soft b or rounded b which we now call B-flat.  Those eight possible note names/letters were the complete set of standard notes at the time.  This is the origin of the musical clef, as the F, C, and G signs we still use are stylized versions of those letters.  Originally, in Guido's system, any note letter could function as a clef sign by marking a line or space. But since Guido's notation system was so new, he added yet another guiding feature -- colored lines: And the lines are also gone over in colors [...].  We use two colors,
  namely yellow and red, and by means of them I teach you a very useful
  rule that will enable you to know readily to what tone and to what
  letter of the monochord every neume and any sound belongs; [...]
  wherever you see the color yellow, there is the third letter [C], and
  whenever you see the color red, there is the sixth letter [F], whether
  these colors be on the lines or between them....2 Originally, F and C were singled out and indicated with colored lines.  Note here that these colored F and C lines could actually occur on a staff line or in a space, and they could be indicated in any octave.  Why did Guido choose these particular notes?  Two main reasons:3 Here's a 12th-century example of this early notation, with red lines to indicate F and yellow lines (somewhat faded) to represent C.  You'll also notice the F in front of the staves on the upper part of the page (which looks a bit like our modern F clef with its two dots forming the lines of the letter F), as well as the C notated in front as a clef on the bottom of the page. As noted above, in the first Guidonian notation any letter could be placed in front of the staff to indicate the note for a line or space.  Looking at the first couple centuries of staff notation, the most common pitches singled out with a letter/clef were, in descending order of frequency (and using modern octave notation): F3, C4, F4, C3, D3, A3, G4, E4, G2, B2, B♭3.4 The most common notes for clefs were F3 and C4 (what we now call ""middle C""), where our modern clefs tend to be located.  But there was a great variety of notes used for clefs.  On the other hand, the use of colored lines was much more restricted.  Very soon after staff notation was introduced, it became common to put both F3 and C4 on lines and to color them red and yellow respectively.  While one might see other F and C lines in other octaves (on lines or in spaces between the normal staff lines), the most common ones came to be on F3 and C4, likely because they fell closest to the middle of the range of notes where most chant melodies were notated.  (Further proof that these colored lines were used to indicate semitones below can be seen with the rare but somewhat consistent use of green lines to indicate the one possible accidental of B♭ in some early manuscripts.  In this case, the C line was sometimes not colored, because it wouldn't have had a semitone below it but rather B♭ instead.5) In any case, eventually the function of the F and C colored lines was combined with the letter notations of clefs.  Originally, the non-colored lines of the staff were often merely scraped into parchment or colored only lightly.  But changes in pens and ink over the centuries made it easier to draw many long lines on a page, leading to standard black or red lines for all the lines of the staff.  The cumbersome practice of having to color some lines red or yellow (for F and C) was gradually phased out.  Instead, F and C emerged as the standard places to put clef signs, now on a staff of only one color.  As F3 and C4 were central to the range of most chants and they both occurred on lines (which had previously been specially colored) these particular octaves of F and C became standard locations. The G clef became standard much later.  In general, there was a need for an anchor point in the upper range of the scale.  The standard Guidonian scale (or gamut) ran between the notes we now call G2 to E5.  A G2 would only require reading three lines below the notated F3 clef, but a note as high as E5 would be more than four lines distant from the C4 clef.  As the standard staff that gradually emerged in the late medieval period only tended to have four lines (though this continued to vary for centuries), there was a need to have some other standard note marked as a clef in the upper register. Unlike the clear evidence from Guido explaining the origin of F and C as central points for clefs, there's no similar single source for the emergence of G clefs. 
 However, there are several factors that may have played into the choice of G as the third place for standard clefs: Simple symmetry: once the F3 and C4 pitches became standard places for clefs, placed two lines apart, it might make sense to place another clef two lines above C4, i.e., on G4.  Many early staff diagrams in theoretical treatises show all the lines of the entire scale, with the central F-C-G placement displaying an obvious symmetry.  (This might be confirmed by occasional instances of D5 also carrying a letter/clef in early sources, again two lines above the G4.) Once F and C became the standard places for clef signs, G was already a prominent note to use for a third clef, particularly at the very bottom of the scale range on G2, a note then called gamma-ut.  We still use that G line as the lowest standard line in modern bass staff notation, as it was the lowest note of the scale.  Even in much later sources (up to the 16th, 17th, and even 18th centuries), this lowest staff line was sometimes marked with a capital Greek letter gamma (Γ), particularly in theoretical treatises explaining the origin of the scale.  Given the central use of a G two octaves lower, perhaps the G4 line also seemed a reasonable place to indicate a clef. G was also the starting pitch of a hexachord.  Aside from staff notation, Guido also introduced a method of solmization, originally using the syllables Ut-Re-Mi-Fa-Sol-La.  The Mi-Fa interval contained the notorious semitone.  In the original medieval scale, there were only three places to begin the Tone-Tone-Semitone-Tone-Tone pattern of the hexachord: C, F (with a B♭) and G (with a B♮).  As the two other choices for clefs -- F3 and C4 -- functioned as Ut in hexachords, one natural choice for a clef in the upper range might be G4, which also functioned originally as the highest Ut in the gamut.  (As mentioned in the point above, the lowest Ut was already frequently signaled with a Γ clef.) Simple process of elimination.  Once F3 and C4 emerged as the standard clefs that fell on lines, a clef in the upper range should also preferably fall on a line.  E4 is problematic as clefs originally indicated semitones below, and this one has a semitone above.  B4 is similarly problematic and potentially contained the flat/natural issue too.  D5 could work, and is in fact seen sometimes (as I noted above), but it's rather high in the topmost register of the original gamut.   G4 is on a line and lacks the other issues, in addition to all the positive features I've already noted. Whatever the exact reason (probably mostly points 1 and 4 above), G4 emerged as the other standard clef location during the 14th century and has remained so ever since.  However, it should be noted that until the mid-18th century, the F and C clefs were still the most standard ones, the ones originally based on Guido and the position of the semitone.  G clefs until the past couple centuries tended only to occur in notation for certain instruments that were pitched high; they were rarely encountered in vocal music or keyboard music (even with a wide span), where C clefs were still preferred in the upper range. 1From a Prologue written by Guido, quoted from Thomas Forrest Kelly, Capturing Music: The Story of Notation (Norton, 2015), pp. 62-63. 2Quoted in Kelly, p. 63. 3For a more detailed explanation, see pp. 18-19 of Joseph Smits van Waesberghe, ""The Musical Notation of Guido of Arezzo,"" Musica Disciplina 5 (1951), pp. 15-53. 4Smits van Waesberghe, p. 33. 5See Smits van Waesberghe, pp. 41-43.

I want to learn how to sing. Where do I start?,"As @luserdroog said in the comments, it would be best if you could get at least a couple lessons.  Otherwise you risk learning bad habits with the physical aspects (that can't be taught well except in person) that you'll have to un-learn later. Another approach is to join a community choir.  While some choirs require auditions, others do not (particularly church choirs, but not exclusively religious).  The choirs I've sung in have included work on technique, not just learning the repertoire."
Why does the C7 chord on guitar omit the G note (5th) in open position?,"Two reasons.  You don't have enough fingers to play it.  The fifth is the most expendable note in a 7th chord (1-3-5-7). Without the 7, it wouldn't be a 7th. Without the 3rd, it wouldn't be major or minor. Without the root, it wouldn't be the chord that it is. But the fifth doesn't contribute any vital property of the chord. There is this other fretting option which gives you a G:"
Algorithms for music composition,"has been around for 20 years. Max gives you the parts to create unique sounds, stunning visuals, and engaging interactive media. These parts are called ‘objects’ – visual boxes that contain tiny programs to do something specific. Each object does something different. Some make noises, some make video effects, others just do simple calculations or make decisions. In Max you add objects to a visual canvas and connect them together with patchcords. You can use as many as you like. By combining objects, you create interactive and unique software without ever writing any code (you can do that too if you really want to). Are you aware that algorithmic composition is something that started centuries ago, in one form or another? In recent years, algorithmic composition has received a lot of academic study. There is a Wikipedia article on Algorithmic Composition. The article itself provides a cursory overview of this field. It doesn't have a lot of practical information but it has a bibliography that you could use to look for more information. The Wikipedia article also provides a long list of commercial and open-source music software apps for algorithmic composition. It would be worth your while to try some of those and see what you can learn from them. Some of them are for creating avant-garde experimental music, and some of them, like Band in a Box, are for composing recognizable mainstream jazz. There is a modular toolkit for algorithmic composition with a graphical user interface called Max which is in use all over the world, particularly in academic circles. As an interesting aside, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart published an algorithmic music system in 1787, called the Musical Dice Game. It involved arranging musical phrases (composed by Mozart himself) in different combinations according to the roll of dice and a set of rules. This comes under the category of what is referred to as stochastic composition. You can Google ""Mozart musical dice game"" for more references. Here is one reference worth reading. Other topics to look into from the pre-computer era would be aleatoric composition (championed by the 20th-century composer John Cage) and 12-tone serial composition (championed by 20th-century composer Arnold Schoenberg and explored by many other composers since then). Many pieces (most of them extremely dissonant and atonal) by these composers are now in the standard repertoire of 20th-century classical music."
What to check when buying a new electric guitar?,"When it comes to buying your first electric guitar, you want to take your time, try not to rush into it. Once you have found a guitar that suits your intended playing style, and price range, there a few things it would be a good idea to check.  Most decent guitar shops offer a free setup with each guitar purchase. Get one done anyway, even if the guitar seems fine. A well set up guitar is a joy to play, one with no setup at all can be an annoying and frustrating experience to play.  With your first amp, I would recommend a small solid state amp. Again, as Stuart mentioned, Line 6, Marshall and Fender all market a very good range of beginner amps, with, in my opinion, The Line 6 Spider IV series being the most versatile and probably cheapest.  In terms of other accessories, you need a cable (the amp does not come with one), a guitar strap, and picks. I would suggest getting a range of pick weights/thicknesses and find your preference, even if you already have a preferred pick when playing acoustic.  I would also suggest a clip on chromatic tuner, so you can tune quickly. You may already have one if you play acoustic, but if not, get one, they are invaluable.  Hope this helps! :)"
"If someone can sing a melody, why can they not also recognize the intervals within that melody?","I think the answer boils down to what you mean by ""knowing"" the intervals. To do this [sing a tune back] you surely need to be able to know the intervals in the tune you have just heard and then replay it back with your voice. I don't think ""knowing"" these intervals in order to sing something back means you know if an interval is, e.g., a major or a minor third. When you sing something, you're just mimicking something you already know. There's not necessarily any true ""knowledge"" here; just ask the countless opera singers that sing for hours in another language without actually knowing how to speak it. They can reproduce the sounds, but they don't fully understand the meaning behind them. The same is true here. But there's an added wrinkle: intervallic ear training is problematic because it's teaching you intervals within a very specific functional context. People use ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" as an ascending octave, but it's really an ascending octave from scale-degree 1 up to another scale-degree 1. If you're singing scale-degree 3, thinking of ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" won't always be helpful; you may well sing up to scale-degree 1 (a minor sixth), not an octave up to scale-degree 3. As another example, people can know what a major second is (it begins ""Happy Birthday""), but they may only be able to recognize it accurately when it's between scale-degrees 5 and 6 in major (as it is in that tune). They'll likely have some problems hearing—and definitely creating without prior reference—that same major second between scale-degrees 3 and ♯4."
How to create Chord progressions that make sense,"Great question - I remember when I myself was confused about this very same thing many years ago, and indeed at first, it all seems completely random.  In order to answer your question, there needs to be a little background: Historically, thinking about music in terms of harmonic progression is one that has really only come to complete prominence in the last 150 years or so (not very long when considering the past 2000 years...)  Mozart was coming out of the Baroque period, and during that time, many people thought of music linearly - as in, vertical harmonies are the result of linear motion, not the other way around.  Mahler and Sibelius are a little more difficult to pin-down - Sibelius wrote a lot of programmatic and nature-oriented music, and through his technique of teleological genesis could be argued that in his own way, he was thinking linearly (or perhaps by phrase modules) moreso than harmonically, but I digress. It is important to remember that in addition to the composers you mentioned, many other composers thought about larger implications of key relationships, and as a result, invented a myriad number of devices to facilitate movement between these relationships.  These devices (tonicization, modulation, chromatic saturation) and many others would take too long to describe accurately in a simple answer.  But, it is important to remember that they used these devices, and you have not begun to use them.  Therefore, your music will not sound like there music. When writing music, it comes differently for some people in terms of inspiration, and should come differently for people depending on the project.  For example, if you're writing a song for your band, you'll probably come up with chord progression first.  However, if you're setting text for an art song or working on a sonata for tuba or something, you'll probably come up with a couple of riffs you like before you add chords. Moral: Don't panic; start with whatever you hear first. Yes, there are some ""canned"" progressions.  For example: A lot of composers (especially the famous ones) were regarded for their economic use of chords - they repeated them over and over again.  This use provided harmonic consistency throughout the work, and locally, phrases. Substitution You may or may not be familiar with scales and keys.  With popular music, often keys are ignored, which can make it challenging if you want to put chords together that sounds like they should go together. If you are reading the Piston (good text, through incredibly dry) then you should know that chords in major keys can be represented by each degree of the scale like this: I, ii, iii, IV, V, vi, vii° In a common progression (I-IV-V-I for example), a chord or chords may be substituted with chords that share like notes.  IV may be substituted with ii or vi, I may be substituted with vi or iii, V may be substituted with iii or vii° for example. (It should be noted that iii is an incredibly weak chord and cannot be effectively used as a substitute for V.) Cadences It would be a good idea to learn about the different types of cadences and how / when to use them.  You can then use the canned progressions to direct your subordinate harmonies to point toward the cadences and to give your piece forward motion. My Advice Start with a simple canned chord progression and make it an exercise to write some music using only those chords.  Do this in all 12 keys.  Once you feel comfortable, begin occasionally substituting some of the chords for more interesting harmonic possibilities.  You will eventually develop your own style about what you like to hear and how it should be notated."
Cleaning the fretboard of an electric guitar,"If you are talking about the actual fretboard between the frets, you'll need a soft cloth and typically lemon or bore oil, which will help remove the dirt. Along the fret, you'll need some kind of edge, wrapped in the cloth, to dislodge the cruft. Of course, you have to be careful not to scar the wood. If it's the actual fret you're talking about, protect the fretboard around a fret with some masking tape, get some 000 steel wool and polish it a bit. I've just done a very dirty neck, it's actually very rewarding how shiny they get after so little work! But that situation was quite extreme. [EDIT adding steps] : For day-to-day maintenance I would just clean under each string when I change it a bit, and I change only one string at a time, be it a fixed or floating bridge, unless I'm doing something specific, like, say, a yearly or so cleaning. Alternatively, with a floating bridge you have the option of removing the springs entirely from the claw to have access to the neck (also very useful when working on the electronic)."
How to use Piano pedals without using the foot?,"Can't use feet well, but if you could move a knee to one side, it would be a simple lever attachment to the pedal, maybe from your wheelchair. Look at knee levers that pedal steel players use. You only really need the damper pedal - the 'soft' pedal could be added later, but it's not as vital as the sustain."
How do I keep my concentration going to the end and not get distracted thinking about how well it's going?,"For me, the issue stems from the difference between practice and public performance.  Most of us, I think, practice far more than we perform publicly.  Since a primary goal of practice is improvement, and improvement requires self-assessment, a musician can get used to constant self-assessment when practicing. Understanding that, I think the key is to ""turn off"" this self-assessment.  It is not enough to be able to do this just in performance; rather, one must practice this skill of ""not practicing!""  The way I suggest is to designate part of a practice as a run-through, just as though it was a performance.  Record this run-through!  Doing so is important so that you know in advance that any mistakes will be picked up by the recorder for later identification, so it is not necessary to self-assess during the run-through, at least not the way one does in typical practice.  You can then listen to the recording to see what problems you had.  In all likelihood, you will find problems you did not find during normal practice, simply because the situation is different. As you try this technique, you will become more adept at turning off the constant self-assessment.  You can then focus on the present moment in your music without worry. I must caution, of course, that not all self-assessment gets turned off in performance.  For example, playing in tune requires assessment throughout the performance.  If I find that I have gone sharp relative to the ensemble, I will make the mouthpiece adjustment necessary at my next reasonable opportunity.  Granted, I can force pitches down, but for my own comfort and better tone, moving the mouthpiece is needed.  I could not know to do so if I was not self-assessing in this way.  However, doing so does not entail assessing notes already gone by.  Instead, it requires ""living in the present,"" as I think you are seeking to do during a performance."
"When playing drums behind the beat, what instruments define the actual beat?","All of the instruments can define the beat, but in order the most important (in a typical 4 piece) are - drums, bass, rhythm guitar, lead guitar. You can define a laid back beat just with the drums - if everyone else plays as normal, but you swing your beats, you will get a much more fluid feel to a piece. To do this well requires the band to work well together so they don't have to follow the swing. As you mention, you can play your snare or hi-hat off the beat to clearly define this movement, or you can let it be inferred, by letting another instrument play around your rhythm. update Based on your update, the drummer will not play all his drums behind the beat, but will typically keep one of the drums on time and move the others around that beat.  A very experienced band can take turns leading or lagging the beat, but you really need to know each other well to manage this successfully."
Why does the orchestra tune to the oboe?,"I found this: Circumstances of history, mostly, but also acoustics. The first orchestras (in the late 1600s) were mainly string instruments. A pair of oboes was sometimes used to strengthen the first and second violin parts. Soon composers were writing separate parts for the oboe, exploiting its singing tone as a contrast to the violins. The bright, rather penetrating sound of the oboe was easy to hear, and its pitch was more stable than gut strings, so it was natural to rely on it for tuning (One can also imagine it settling, or preventing arguments. Twenty string players squabbling over a tuning note, then asking the oboist to intervene). Other instruments drifted in and out of the orchestra – flutes, bassoon, French horns, clarinets – before it’s instrumentation became relatively standardized as we know it today. But oboes were almost always present, so they became the standard instrument for tuning. Source: Why does the orchestra always tune to the oboe? And reading the link provided by @leftaroundabout in Why tune to the oboe? we can say the reason there is mostly because of historial reasons. In other words, it is a habit."
Why do we use such complicated notation?,"Your notation may work for a free form melody, but that's it. How will you notate several notes played at once?
How will you notate exact rhythms if you don't split up a bar into beats and subbeats and give each note an exact duration?
Which octaves are those notes? I agree that standard notation (common music notation) is complicated, but there are pretty good reasons for it being that way.
My personal project is to make easier notation, though.  Starting with pianoroll notation (and all it's deficiencies), I'm adding the things that make standard notation better than it, TO it...  See my website for some examples: http://pianocheetah.com/tutorial/screenshots.html  (oh dear, I'll have to take some new screen shots.  Those are out of date.)"
"I play oboe and I'm in the top band, but I feel like a failure whenever my band director yells at me","If your band leader/conductor/teacher is yelling at you then there's only one failure in the room, and it's not you. Whether you're leading complete beginners or seasoned performers, yelling and belittling people who are struggling is never productive, and in a school setting it's downright unprofessional. Unless none of your bandmates has ever made a mistake, chances are they're much more sympathetic to your situation than you think. If they've ever been on the receiving end of his/her yelling then doubly so. Sure, it's annoying if someone in the band makes a mistake, but anyone who isn't perfect (and that's everyone) has been there themselves, and they're much more likely to want to help you out than to run you down. Is your director approachable enough for you to ask for help practising your solo? I'm guessing maybe not. If you can't get help from him/her, why not see if you can get together with some of your bandmates outside rehearsals to go through the bits you find difficult?"
Are there pieces that require retuning an instrument mid-performance?,"In relation to the violin (or other string instrument) the specific technique described — using the tuning peg to detune and retune a pitch — is called peg scordatura (also peg glissando and glissando scordatura). A very clear example of this occurs in Alfred Schnittke's Stille Nacht (1978) for violin and piano. At the end of the piece, the violin detunes and retunes the open G string down to D and back to G again, creating an eerie glissando. Note also the very end of the piece, in which the tuning peg is used to create a vibrato/trill effect. The below recording is timed to the peg scordatura. 

 In the comments below, it's pointed out that for technical reasons, peg scordatura will only be found on the final note of a piece. Here are some counterexamples: György Kurtág's Kafka Fragmente (Op. 24) includes peg glissandi: for example, the section from 27:37 – 28:58 in the below recording. 

 Stavros Choplaros's ""Sonata da Chiesa"" (2015) uses peg scordatura throughout. The below images are just two examples from the score, which is included in his doctoral dissertation from King's College (PDF pages 139–150).   In Karl Gerber's ""Three Formulae on One String"", a computer-controlled violin employs peg scordatura. In the below Vimeo recording, the technique is first used beginning at 1:14.

"I can learn guitar fast, but I haven't got the nerve to sit and practice for hours, how to practice for long sessions?","Congratulations on your decision to dedicate time and energy to learning to play a musical instrument.  The guitar is my favorite as it is one of the most versatile instruments in the world for playing many types of music using many different playing styles and techniques.  Plus you can sing while playing the guitar if that's your thing.   As you have discovered, it takes a great deal of dedication and practice to learn to play the guitar.  Many (most actually) aspiring beginning guitarist grow frustrated early in the process and give up.   I teach beginner guitar. My goal with a new student, is to help them quickly connect with the joy and gratification of learning to actually play some music they personally enjoy. Then they will become more passionate about learning to improve their skills and may eventually develop a thirst for learning more advanced techniques so they can learn to play even more songs they love on their instrument.  Learning to play guitar is a chosen hobby and not mandatory.  So if practice becomes too much like work or too boring, repetitive, mundane or tiring - you will never develop the passion and desire to continue to improve.  I believe that they key to keeping a beginning guitarist from burning out, is to get them having fun as quickly as possible!  When playing is fun - a student will want to put in more time with their instrument!     Even playing things you enjoy just for fun will help you improve your skills, timing, rhythm, and technique.    Of course, there are some very basic exercises a beginning student must master before he/she can play much on any instrument. Some basic ideas on how the instrument works, how the notes are laid out, and some hand coordination and basic rhythm exercises are probably fundamental to making much progress with playing actual music. With guitar, I like to start with some very simple and easy chords and chord changes.   My goal with a new student, is to help them quickly get to a point where they can play at least a simple rendition of some songs they will enjoy playing. I start by teaching the minimal skills they need in order to actually play their first song.  Then I build on that to help them learn another song in the same key.  Eventually we learn new chords in different keys and they can learn more songs.  The idea is, I teach basic chords, rhythm, and strumming patterns as the building blocks to learning to PLAY music they enjoy!  I suggest you learn to play complete renditions of songs that you like.  Start with very simple arrangements using songs that can be played with basic easy chords.  Focus on building your repertoire (number of songs you can play).  As you learn new songs, you will need to learn new chords and new chord changes and new strumming techniques.   You don't have to work on every skill a guitarist might need all at one time.  If you focus on learning one song of your choosing because you know you will enjoy playing it -  then the practice needed to master the new chord changes or strumming pattern will not seem so much like work.  You have a simple very achievable goal to focus on (learn to play Song X).  Each new song you decide to learn should stretch you just a bit so that each time you set a new goal to learn a new song, you will force yourself to learn a new chord or a new technique.   The point here is to take it in small steps that lead to a reward (the satisfaction of knowing you conquered yet another song on your list) relatively quickly. The other point is to make sure that you are thoroughly enjoying your playing time - which will increase your passion for playing and desire to learn more songs - which will require actual ""practice"" to learn the new chords etc.  Finally, while you are in the beginning stages of learning guitar, keep your practice/playing sessions short but practice several times per day. A good schedule might be 30 minutes in the morning, 30 minutes at lunch, and 30 minutes in the evening - depending on your personal time constraints.   Shorter sessions will give your finger and hand muscles time to rest before they get too tired.  Shorter practice sessions will keep you from getting frustrated and burned out. Be sure that every practice session incorporates as much fun (playing) as it does work (practicing).  As you develop more stamina and the number of songs you are able to play for fun increases, you will actually look forward to picking up your guitar and it will become harder and harder to put it down!  Good luck on your journey towards a hobby and skill that can bring a lifetime of enjoyment for yourself and those you choose to share your music with.  Most importantly - HAVE FUN!! "
Where do musicians draw their melodies from?,"But there are rhythms, harmonies and melodies in nature. When you walk, you establish a nice solid beat. Two beats to the bar, at its most basic level - but by adjusting your gait or the way you count, you can think of it as four beats, or three, or as many as you like. Skipping brings in different rhythms. The musical intervals that make up melodies are based on fundamental physical properties of nature. An octave is what you get when you halve the length of a string (or other source of pitched vibration). A fifth is what you get from a third of the lengths. These harmonics are present in the pitches of nature. When the wind blows through the rocks and trees, you can hear tones and their harmonics, coming in and out of focus. Those pitches also ""fall out"" of instruments - the first time you stretch a string across a sounding box and start plucking it, you will find them. Of course, there are cultural inputs too. Speech feeds into music, influencing both melody and rhythm. It's pretty easy to see how conversational speech leads to chanting and poetry, which leads to singing, which leads to melody. Then add millennia of cultural feedback and technology. All sorts of things go into the mix, from the dripping of water in a cave, to the rhythm of a horse-drawn loom, the clatter of train wheels against tracks, to the sounds made when a transistor-based oscillator is fed through a loudspeaker."
Is it really mandatory to practise sight reading at the piano?,"Yes it is really important to practise sightreading. Being able to sightread well makes it much quicker to learn new pieces and eventually possible to play pieces reasonably well without having practised them at all.  Sightreading does improve simply by learning repertoire, but not that quickly. This is because you are only truly sightreading a piece the first time play through it. After that, you will have memorised at least some of the material, and are no longer sightreading in the strictest sense.  This is often a problem for pupils studying for instrumental music exams. Once they have memorised their pieces, and are “polishing” them, they are not really reading the sheet music while playing them, even if they are following the music to aid memory. For this reason I find it really important to ensure that pupils read and play a wide variety of new music alongside pieces they may be learning in detail for exams or performances. "
Why are conductors required at orchestra performances?,"There are several reason. The most basic would be “so that they could play together”. A symphonic orchestra is much bigger than a band, and being in perfect sync with the player at the other side of the stage or pit can be hard without visual cues. In smaller ensemble, such as a quartet, quintet, or even chamber orchestra, there might be no conductor or the conductor might be a musician among others. The second, most important, point is that the conductor actually, well, conducts the piece. They decide of how the piece is to be played, at which tempo, with which atmosphere, … They are the master of everything unwritten on the sheet. Heck, they also are the master of everything actually written on the sheet if they deem so necessary. This information is conveyed beforehand, during rehearsal, but also during play; a good conductor will convey a lot of information through body language. Have you ever seen a (very beginner) conductor who doesn’t breathe when should? It’s awfully hard to understand even when to start playing. And that’s for the basics: when to start, etc. A good conductor will express which emotions they want the music to convey through body language. As for sheet music, that would depend a lot about how the music is written. Most orchestral music is quite structurally complex with respect to pop music standards. A pop song usually is a chorus, a few verses and a bridge or two intertwined. What you need to remember is the chords, themes and your part in each of these section, and then you’re good. You can move around those a bit to make the music richer, but that’s it. In an orchestra, however, the pieces can be much longer, the parts more complex or, well, boring (“count 76 measures”, anyone?). Orchestras also typically have a wide repertoire, and little time to rehearse each piece in that repertoire. You could very well have only one or two rehearsals before playing a piece. Sure, each musician works by themself, but that’s little help. On the other hand, soloists spend more time studying and practising a piece, and, as soloists, play mostly themes which are easily distinguished when listening to the whole piece, which explains why they can often play without sheets."
Why do films sometimes transpose everything by a quarter step?,"log (25 / 24) / log (2) * 1200 = 70.67, so the conversion of a standard movie (24 frames per second), to be broadcast on European TV (25 frames per second) will shift all pitches up 70 cents; that's one common situation that you may be referring to."
Learning to create melodies,"As you listen to music analytically (especially music you like), there are various patterns and things you'll discover, which will help you learn how to write melodies. For example, it's obvious that in many pieces, a melodic phrase spans a number of bars that's divisible by the number 4. If you can pin down the 4 parts of some such melodies (that you like, of course), you can figure their role in the melody. I noticed rather early, for example, that I really favored melodies where the first and the second part are the same, except for the last note. You may find some such patterns that work for you, as well. Also, as you might have noticed already, movements in semitones are great for conveying sadness. Use that! Or, if that's not your cup of tea, throw away those and stick with the pentatonic scale. It has a very unique and recognizable style and songs that use it are quite often described as ""awesome"". Work out how the chord progression (and the expectations it creates to the listener) works together with your melody. For example, the same melody has an entirely different effect if it ends in the I chord (expected) than the same melody would if it ended in the VI chord (""deceptive""). And a melody can raise expectations if it rests in a V chord for a while - it often implicitly promises an equal amount of melody coming soon. Perform mutations on shorter melodies. For instance, try repeating the chords of the melody, but in strategic places pick a different note (from the same chord) than you did last time. For example, in a V chord, where you played the II note in the first iteration, now play the V note instead. This trick is common to let the listener know that this particular section of the song is reaching or has reached its climax. Alternate the mood as you go. If your melody has a minor feel, try following it up with something that has a major feel. Pieces that don't do that run the risk of sounding monotonous. In my experience, I've found that the human mind notices and appreciates transitions more than stationary situations. The happy part will sound happier if it follows a sad part and the sad part that comes after a happy one will sound even sadder and more dramatic. Always keep in mind that, as it happens with all works of art, the point is not only the destination, but also the journey. A melody can be a journey to the other side of the scale and back. That doesn't mean that there aren't pieces where the melody stays around just a couple of notes. But usually, these kinds of pieces invest in something other than their property of being melodic - some kind of harmonic or even purely rhythmic effect, perhaps. Of course, you can also just choose some chords (even at random, if you're willing to experiment), and write voices using the rules you know from studying music theory (if you have any background in that). There are some great melodies to be discovered there, while if you stick with more predictable chord progressions, your songs will tend to sound the same as other songs. Try sticking to an unsual time signature (it may take a few minutes of practice beforehand) and explore what you can produce off that. You can even just read a poem or some lyrics (which you've never heard music to) and try to notice how you instinctively read it in your head (or out loud), then write down whatever melody has popped up in your head.  It's fun and some recognizable melodies often come out of previously written verses. Or you can literally watch birds sitting on power wires."
Can anyone learn to sing?,"If you can hear yourself being out of tune, chances are you can teach yourself to fix it... or work with a vocal coach who is experienced enough in communicating HOW to change your technique... I've worked miracles with students who thought they couldn't sing in the past, and the results are wonderful for both teacher and student.  On the other hand, if you can't always hear whether you're on pitch or if you've had significant ear drum damage, you might actually have some tone matching issues.   I suggest seeking a vocal coach at least a few times a month to get you off to a good start.  Much luck to you! "
What are the pros and cons of Traditional Grip vs. Matched Grip for snare and drumset?,"Traditional Grip Pros: Traditional Grip Cons: The pros and cons for Matched Grip are basically the opposite of those for traditional. I am an advocate of learning matched first, and traditional later if you need/want to. I regularly play with both and my left hand is equally good in either grip, although it does take some extra effort to keep things that way. Traditional grip is most commonly used in marching percussion because it is great for playing on a tilted drum (in fact, that's why it was invented). Many jazz drummers use traditional, but I've noticed that most of them switch to matched when they actually need to move around the kit. It ultimately comes down to what works for you. :D"
"Why do we need note names like B♭, D♭ etc.? Why not use only A♯, C♯ and so on? [duplicate]","The equivalences you mention---C♯/D♭, D♯/E♭, etc.---aren't actually the same note.  They're called enharmonically equivalent pairs, but only in Equal Temperament are they tuned to the same frequency.  See this question for more information on why they're not the same note. As for why we need flatted notes at all, let's look at the how major scales are put together. We need to agree on these things: With these two principles in mind, let's build an F Major scale: We start with F.  A whole note up and we get to G.  Another whole note, and we have A.  Now the first half-step.  What is this note?  It can't be an A♯, because we've already used A.  It can't be a B♮, because B is a whole step up from A.  It has to be some kind of B, but a half-step lower than B♮.  And so: B♭. Now that we've invented B♭, let's create the B♭ Major scale: B♭, C, D,... uh-oh.  Guess we need an E♭.  And when we create the E♭ Major scale, we'll have to create an A♭, etc. etc. Of course this same idea justifies the existence of sharped notes as well.  Create the G Major scale, and when you get to the seventh note you find that you've used up all the letters except F, yet you need a note a whole step up from E (or, if you like, a half step down from G).  And so you're forced to create F♯. One could ask why it is that the interval from E to F need be a half step.  If E to F were a whole step and F to G a half step, then we wouldn't need an F♯ to make the G Major scale.  This is true, but it's also robbing Peter to pay Paul: then the D Major scale would still require a C♯, while the C Major scale would now require an F♭."
Why does the melodic minor scale turn into natural minor when descending?,"The main “purpose” of the raised degrees in ascending melodic and harmonic minor is to create a strong leading note: Clearly, this leading tone only makes sense if you actually do resolve it upwards. If you go down instead, this can rather leave a feeling of unresolved tension. In harmonic minor, this unresolvedness is not as apparent because the attention will be more drawn to the exotic (if not somewhat jarring) 1½ tone step: Melodic minor avoids these 1½ tone steps to create smoother melody lines. When going up, you still want the leading tone, hence you raise the ⅶ and also the ⅵ. But when going down, it's more sensible to just leave both of them natural. Of course that doesn't mean you can't use raised ⅵ and ⅶ degrees when going downwards. In particular if one voice already has one of these raised tones, it would be problematic to un-raise them in another voice. For example, the fugue that RRR brought up has this passage: Here, the bass is already going up in melodic minor to the A root, and especially if the bass does this you really want the leading note effect, so it is F♯-G♯-A. At the same time, the alto needs to cross the ⅵ / ⅶ territory to get down to the Ⅴ (e). Using a g-natural there would cause a pretty bad clash between the voices: On alternative would be to use harmonic-descending there but again, that sounds a bit Spanish. Especially in a middle voice it's more innocuous to just adapt to the context of melodic-minor from the bass voice there, even if it means traversing the scale in the “wrong” direction."
"When counting in, why do people often do it at two speeds? (1_2_1234)","I love questions like this! I count like this when I'm counting in for a band, and I just had to take a step back and evaluate, and I think the reason I do it is this: A count of just '1234' would be too fast, from starting the count to expecting people to play on the next '1', meaning the start would be sloppy. If I count '12341234', unless it's explicitly defined with everyone I might count in for ever that I give 2 bars of count, every so often I'd get some people starting on the second '1' in the middle of my count. Not just sloppy, ugly. If I count 1_2_3_4_, then that doesn't convey the feel of the song that I clearly want to, in which the measures are quite short (i.e. 1234), and the feel is as such. Risks getting the feel wrong. Therefore, the logical conclusion is to use the style put forward in your question, to both give people time to get ready to play, and to convey the feel that the measures are short.  As for your second sub-question, no, it's not possible to tell after the 2_ that I'm going to count double after that, but either way, unless you're counting a song in 2 (i.e. 1_2_1_2_), you're not going to play on the next beat, meaning you don't strictly need to know what's coming next."
Every time I press 'record' I forget how to play and sing!,"Well, ok, I see what you're saying.  Keep that record button down all the time then.  If that makes you suck all the time, then so be it.  Suck and slowly improve. If your music is only being listened to by you, how do you really know it's any good to begin with?  You can't judge yourself while practicing.  That's a skewed view.  You have to judge yourself on a recording or, you know, it really doesn't count. How good you ""can possibly if you're lucky"" play is usually way different than how good you ""do actually reliably, repeatedly play on an average take"". Keep the record button down.  Practice with the record button down."
Memorizing notes on guitar fretboard,"Good question! While it is important to know the what notes are at each fret, it's not necessary to know all the notes at once, especially if you're a beginner. To start memorizing the notes, first memorize the all the notes at each fret on the last two bass strings (tip: the notes repeat at the the 12th fret). Then, using octave shapes, you should be able to figure out the notes on all the other strings. This link explains it in detail: http://www.justinguitar.com/en/IM-116-NotesOnNeck.php Another thing that helps in learning the notes on the fret is to play scales, and say each note out loud. Regarding songs that are not in standard tuning, if its a tuning that you use fairly often, such a Drop D, you'll probably find that you would be able the figure out the notes, especially if you have learned the notes in standard tuning. If it is a less common tuning, you could use intervals to identify notes by by. It's probably not necessary to completely master every tuning that you use, some guitarists simply mess around with an odd tuning and come up with a great song. And it there's no difference between learning notes on a acoustic or electric guitar, except the fact that a electric guitar usually has a longer neck.  "
Fast Chord Identification,"Learn to recognize intervals between notes quickly. For example, notes that skip a line or space are a third apart. Notes that skip seven are an octave apart. When reading a chord quickly, read the root/lowest note and then the intervals above it and place them in the key. With experience you will be able to recognize common voicings by shape alone."
Are we all born with the ability to detect a note out of tune?,"The foundation of scales and relative tonality is the fact that all humans are innately able to detect intervals. We can detect an octave because an octave is two notes where one is twice the frequency of the other. Similarly, there are basic proportional relationships between the frequency of two notes that are fifth, or a third, or a whole step apart but they are harder to detect because the relationship is less obvious. In a fifth, for example, one note is a vibration 2/3 as fast as the other. The innate ability to react to relative intonation gives rise to the fact that minor keys sound different from major keys, and notes out of tune often sound ""wrong"" even to people with no musical training. The less obvious a tonal freqency relationship, the more learning is involved. Almost everyone can tell that an octave sounds ""right"" and a 7 1/2th is ""wrong"" with no training. So far I have not found any research indicating that any culture has a scale system that is not based on the octave (see this article, these music theory class notes and the Wikipedia section on consonance and dissonance which answer your question better than any of the answers here). Because of the instrinsic physiological phenomena of the interval, Eastern and Arabic scales are based on the same intervals as Western scales and just have more or fewer steps. Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, and Ancient Greek (Syntolydian) musical scales are all based on the octave, demonstrating that the human ability to detect that interval is nature rather than nurture. The fact that an A above middle C is 440hz, however, is arbitrary (""absolute"") and therefore must be learned. Some people seem to be better at learning to recognize absolute frequencies and these people are often said to ""have perfect pitch."" This perfect or absolute pitch is what is required to tune an instrument or sing a certain pitch with no reference. It is not held in common across cultures; for example the frequency of the base note Kung in Chinese music was often changed by the emperor (although it is usually treated as almost the same as a western F). It must have been very hard to learn perfect pitch when your base note changed over time! In conclusion, YES, we are born with the ability to detect a note out of tune relative to another note (helps if it's an octave or fifth), but NO, we are not born with the ability to detect a note out of tune on its own."
"I sight read at 20 bpm, and not getting any faster","The advice about starting slow and gradually increasing is certainly not wrong, but I'd consider adding another ""mode"" of practicing especially when it comes to sight reading. So the default mode is to focus on being correct rather than fast. When you want to learn the piece or when dealing with a method book that is teaching things in addition to just sight-reading, default to starting slow and working your way up. Find trouble spots and ""loop"" them, etc. But (sometimes) to practice sight-reading or just as an occasional exercise to get yourself out of a rut, try to focus on moving forward without worrying so much about mistakes.  Then as far as your method book, see if that helps you increase the speed of the pieces that you're trying to actually learn. It should improve both your speed of actually recognizing and playing notes as well as your ability to look ahead to what you're playing next. Don't worry about getting every exercise in your method book up to speed (maybe a bit higher than 40 though if you can get there). Do worry about getting them correct before moving on the next. And do internalize the point of the lesson (new key, fingering, or rhythm, etc). But only cherry pick certain pieces to truly perfect and get up to speed. Otherwise you'll never move forward into new positions, etc. And, yeah, every once in a while you should start back at the beginning or an earlier point in the book and review some of the pieces. But you have to balance that with constant progress forward as well."
C Trumpet in Beethoven's 5th symphony,"Back in Beethoven’s days trumpets and horns were not in fact chromatic, which is also the reason why scores call for trumpets in different transpositions. It was possible to play horns chromatically by stopping it, less so with trumpets. This lead to a convention of writing in the transposing pitch with no key signature, so each note that has to be played differently (due to not being a natural note of the instrument) is marked by an accidental. So the Trumpet is in C, but it gets notated without a key signature."
"The function of Gm G♭ B♭ chord progression in ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond""","The move from Gm to GbM is definitely not a standard “classical” progression, although it does start to happen more and more in the late Romantic era and in lots of Impressionist and other neo-tonal styles. It’s perhaps especially common in the triadic minimalism of composers like Philip Glass. I don’t think it’s super common in rock music, which might be part of why it sounds so fresh in the Pink Floyd example.  You’re exactly right that the “connective tissue” of the chord change is the Bb common tone. David Lewin called this move SLIDE, and neo-Riemannian theorists often call it P’ or “P prime,” because it’s the opposite of the connection they call P, which is short for parallel. P connects a major triad to its parallel minor counterpart and vice versa. This means the root and the fifth stay the same, and the third moves by a half step. P’ is the opposite, because, as you noted in your example, the third stays the same while both the root and fifth move by a half step. That’s why it’s the opposite of the parallel move.  Anyway, it’s an extremely cool sound, and it contributes a great deal to the moody effect of the beginning of “Shine on.” EDIT TO ADD:
Sorry, I just realized you also asked about the move from GbM to BbM as well. This move also includes a common tone—notably, the same Bb common tone as the previous move—and half step movements in the other two voices just like in the P’ move. Different voices and directions are involved though. The move is called a “chromatic mediant,” and that’s the name for any two chords with roots a third apart and the same quality (major or minor). There are many questions on the site that explain chromatic mediant a if you want more details. "
Why is the aeolian mode the minor scale?,"The minor scale is not called the ""minor scale"" because it is the most minor. Names don't have to accurately reflect the definition. Modes are sometimes classified as ""minor"" or ""major"" depending on their third (a minor third usually comes with other minor degrees like the flat 7th which is common to all minor modes of the major scale). And of all the minor modes, aolian the natural minor scale (or simply ""minor scale"") is by far the most commonly used in western music. So if it's the one that we use most most of the time, why not simply call it ""minor""? Now why is it the most common minor scale? It's probably because it's the least dissonant minor scale, and the most stable. Dorian, for example, isn't that dissonant, but it's not that stable ; if there is no harmony or drone to support it, the brain may interpret it as a different scale (an Aolian or Ionian scale with a different tonic), like C Maj or A Min instead of D dorian. Phrygian isn't that stable either, and it's more dissonant than aolian, try improvising a melody in E phrygian (without a drone or harmony), and you'll feel like resolving it in A aolian. Even aolian (natural minor scale), isn't stable enough sometimes to escape the pull of the Ionian mode. This is where the melodic and harmonic minor (used over a dominant V chord - e.g G7 in Cmin or E7 in Amin...) come into play. These variations of the minor scale are there to maintain consonance when the dominant is played."
Why does my thumb hurt when I play bar chords?,"Basically, neither fingers nor your wrist should hurt. Tension is your enemy, you have to become aware of tension before it becomes pain. In the words of Joe Satriani : No pain, no pain. If it's the thumb, chances are you're grabbing the neck as if you were falling and needed to hold onto it, that's not the way it should be : the thumb is an anchor for the rest of the hand. When you feel tension, stop, relax your fingers, neck and shoulders. Then get back in playing position but do not hold the strings down, use your fretting hand as if it was caressing the strings. Hold onto that feeling, and carry on practicing. You can also try practicing slower, which anyway always helps focusing on different aspects of your playing."
"Is there a sound theoretical reason why a capella choirs ""drift off"" of the starting pitches in a piece?","I would say yes, and yes. You've explained the problem pretty clearly, and explained its consequence. Choirs frequently find that they sing everything internally, consistently in-tune throughout a piece, but then at the end of the piece, they discover that they are no longer in tune with the reference pitches upon which they started the piece. The frame of reference has drifted. Inexperienced singers don't understand that this is in fact a natural occurance. In fact many choir directors don't understand it either, and expect their choirs to sing in 12-tone equal temperament as if there was a piano playing along all the time. However, singers and string players can compensate for the drift in pitch and try to keep pitches in line with the starting pitches, and end the piece in the same pitch framework where they started. It is a struggle, but it is often possible. Update Reference this previously asked question, about Arnold Schoenberg's observation about why choirs get ""off pitch"": Natural vs. Tempered Semi-Tones As I said previously in my answer to that question: As a singer with perfect pitch, when I am in this situation,
  particularly in performance, it presents a dilemma: if I perceive the
  other choral singers around me drifting away from the starting pitch,
  tonic and key (taking into account the modulations that may be written
  into the piece), do I fight against the other singers by keeping my
  pitches up, relative to the starting pitch and tonic and key, or do I
  ""go with it"" and follow the gradual shift in tonic that everyone else
  is making? In most cases, it's better to ""go with it"" rather than
  ""fight it"", because it produces a more internally consistent sound.
  While I have perfect pitch, I must concede that if a choir were only
  to sing the 12 pitches on the piano, that would not be a good choir,
  because that is not really what choirs are supposed to do."
"How do I become better at ""playing outside""?","The pentatonic scale is a great vehicle for moving outside. It has a very clear structure and sound which the listener is familiar with. Due to its simplicity and familiarity, you can get away with playing it, even if it does not fit the harmony in a traditional sense. The first thing I experimented with when I got into playing outside was ""side-stepping"", i.e. shifting the pentatonic scale up or down by a half-step. Here I think it's important to avoid the most tempting thing, which is simply repeat a phrase a half step lower or higher. Instead, what I practiced was moving down when I actually played the pentatonic scale half a tone higher, and moving up when I used the scale half a tone lower. To give a very simple example, if you play in C major pentatonic, instead of playing C D E (inside) C# D# E# (outside) I would try something like C D E (inside) D# C# A# (outside) The most important thing is the way you get outside and - probably even more important - the way you get back inside. I've come to the conclusion that as long as you get these two steps right, anything goes. Other pentatonic scales that I've found to work well are the scales a minor third up, and a tritone up (or down, which is the same). But just experiment and trust your ears. I've transcribed (guitar tabs) and played an example of Chick Corea playing outside here. In this example, he also uses the pentatonic scale to go outside. Another good tool for playing outside is the whole-tone scale. It also has an obvious inherent logic to it, which helps make your lines sound smooth and musical, even though the individual notes may be totally off. One example I always teach my (more advanced) students is the use of the whole tone scale when playing in dorian. Let's say we're in C dorian, then you'd have the following whole tone sequence inside the scale: Eb F G A The trick is now to continue this sequence using the whole tone scale, which means going outside of C dorian: Eb F G A B C# D#/Eb and with the last note (D#/Eb) we're magically back inside C dorian. There are many more interesting concepts for playing outside, but I think the only way to really learn it is to analyze and learn solos of good players who use this concept, and to develop your ears, so you can hear and find on your instrument what you want to play."
What are some common jazz chord progressions?,"There are, of course, an enormous variety of chord progressions used in jazz.  That said, here are three you should know: The basic 12-bar blues as played in jazz (not as played in blues) usually goes something like: In blues, all these chords would be dominant sevenths.  Jazz players, however, frequently play their diatonic versions. Common variations include replacing the chords in a given bar with a ii-V cadence that resolves to the chord in the next bar.  For example, you could replace the I in bar 4 with a ii-V that resolves to the IV in bar 5. Rhythm Changes is a progression based around the chords of the popular Gershwin tune ""I Got Rhythm"".  It's in the usual 32-bar AABA format, and the traditional key is Bb: These changes are so popular among jazz musicians in large part because they offer myriad opportunities for variation.  You can substitute to your heart's content here and find different ways to navigate the same basic structure.  Here are some common substitution ideas. Like a challenge?  Try this on for size.  I recommend reading this Wikipedia article, which does a better job of explaining the ideas behind the so-called ""Coltrane Changes"" (as most famously used in ""Giant Steps"") than I could do."
"What is the importance of practicing scales on piano, and the proper fingering of them?","Memorizing your scales accomplishes at least these four things: Trains your fingers to play common patterns found in music. There are a lot of scales in music. They're just so satisfying, why not write them? They can be a controlled environment for practicing other techniques, such as playing fast, playing in octaves, and playing fast in octaves. It trains your ear to hear the qualities of a key and the different scale degrees within that key. When learning a new piece, practice scales for the keys within that piece. You'll catch your own mistakes more often since you'll be accustomed to tonal qualities of the keys in that piece. It also trains you to play smoothly in time. Practice speed, but maintaining a steady tempo with a variety of articulations. You could also use them to experiment with rubato (credit to Matthew Read in the comments). [EDIT] Adding another good point from the comments: In addition to @bearcdp's well written answer, I'd like to point out that almost every piano-teaching book I've read, strongly emphasizes the importance of playing a song/riff in all of the 12 keys!. This is annoying in the beginning, but it helps you to get equally familiar with all the different keys (and not just C major and A minor). –  @Saebekassebil"
"With sheet music, how do you determine whether the song is in the major key or the minor key?","If it starts on C and ends on C, it's probably in C.  And vice versa. If it has lots of A minor and E minor chords, it's probably in Am (E is the dominant).  Likewise, lots of Cs and Gs implies C Major. There are a few other indicators — for example, the harmonic minor scale raises the 7th one semitone (as Jenny mentions) and the melodic minor raises both the 6th and 7th while ascending — but largely speaking it doesn't matter.  Frequently, they are two names for the same thing.  Often people say that minor keys sound sad and major keys sound happy or triumphant, but this is nothing more that psychological tricks (see Why do minor keys sound “sad”?). You can use C Major to write a sad song, and you can use A minor to write a happy song.  In the end, the only way to know what key is being used is to ask the composer.  The intent is the only thing that unequivocally distinguishes a major key from the minor with the same key signature."
What is concert pitch?,"""Concert pitch"" comes from how symphonies have learned to deal with tuning various instruments to a common pitch over the years. According to the ISO it's 440 Hertz, which is in the A above middle C range, but, over the years it's been as low as 415, and, even after standardization, is still considered to be in the 430 range in some symphonies. And, according the the linked Wikipedia article, some Baroque ensembles are using A-415 again. So much for standards. So, it comes from classical music, but for those of us not playing classical it has some useful considerations. Think in terms of tuning an individual instrument without the aide of a tuner, and then that instrument in relation to another, again without a tuner: Using an agreed-upon reference pitch AKA ""Concert Pitch"", such as A-440, lets you tune separately then be in pitch together later. Again, 440 is not a magic number, it's only an agreed-up value and you, and your fellow musicians are free to use something else. I have several standalone tuners, plus tuners in one amp, and another in my Pod X3, plus one in GarageBand on my Mac. They all allow me to adjust what they should use as their reference pitch, so, once you've shared the reference value it should be no problem for everyone to adjust their particular tuner, so no excuses. :-) For most of us playing guitar in a band, A-440 is perfectly good. Some bands like to be tuned 1/2 step or a whole step down though. Eddie Van Halen and Stevie Ray Vaughn are two I heard that liked being down 1/2 step. Rather than everyone in the band learn the songs in E-flat or A-flat, they'd tune down and play normally; It's a bit of musical sleight-of-hand that really throws other guitarists off periodically.  Tuning down (or up) can be done either by adjusting the reference frequency, or by leaving it at A-440 then using the tuner's display to track when you're at 1/2 step or 1 step from the reference. Either works, it's really what works for you. It's those less-than-half steps (microtones) that can be a problem and that force adjusting the reference."
How to extend and strengthen low end of vocal range? (I need about a whole tone extra.),"One technique I know helps is to lift our head just a bit and try to relax as you go down. This will open up your airways to the maximum and also leave more room for your vocal cords to vibrate freely (the lower frequencies requires larger movements of the vocal cords). Just be care to not raise your head too much; If you raise your head too much, the vocal chords will stretch, and you will get the opposite effect. You need to find a perfect balance here. I'm not sure if this technique will give you a whole note more down (it will probably give you some improvement), but it will certainly improve the performance and strength of what you are already capable of. And sorry - to do it well, you need to practice... 
Note:
In the other end, when you go up in the frequencies, lower your head so you chin gets closer to your chest. This will help you to be more accurate in hitting the right note when you go up.

"In phase, out of phase pickups","It might help to understand what phase is and what people mean when they say ""in phase"" or ""out of phase"". Technically, phase is the amount of a wave that elapsed relative to some arbitrary point in time. If you consider a simple sinusoidal wave a phase of 0 degrees represents some arbitrary starting point of the wave, every time the wave passes through that same amplitude it's phase has increased by 180 degrees. Lets say we pick an amplitude of 0 as the starting point and we have a simple sinusoidal wave. At a phase of 180 degrees it will pass through zero again, but moving in the opposite direction, and at a phase of 360 degrees it will pass through zero again and be moving in the same direction as it was as 0 degrees. If two waves are equal and ""in phase"" they are passing through the same amplitudes at the same time. When two waves are equal and in phase they sum to produce a wave that is twice the amplitude of either of the original waves. We call this constructive interference. If two waves are equal and 180 degrees out of phase they are passing through opposite amplitudes at the same time. So when one wave is +1, the other would be -1. When two waves are equal and 180 degrees out phase they sum to produce a wave that always has zero amplitude. This is called destructive interference. If we have an idealized setup, where two pickups are in the same spot on a guitar string, then their output should be exactly the same. In this setup, if they're wired in phase their signals will add and you'll get an output signal that is twice the volume of just one pickup or the other. If you wire up this idealized pickup scenario out of phase you'd hear nothing at all. But in reality guitar pickups cannot be situated like this. They're always sampling a different part of the string (sometimes slightly as is the case of side-by-side pickups in a humbucker arrangement, sometimes considerably as is the case with a neck and bridge pickup). So the signals they're producing aren't exactly the same. That means combining them out-of-phase doesn't silence the output. Instead you get some interesting destructive interference happening that produces an output that's usually described as ""quacky"". It's missing some frequencies. If you combine them in phase things don't get twice as loud, but they do get louder than either pickup on their own, as the same frequencies that were aligning to cancel out in the out-of-phase arrangement, align and add in a constructive interference pattern."
"What does ""NC"" mean?","NC (or N.C.) is short for ""No Chord"".
It means that you should only play the indicated notes or melody, and not try to infer or add a chordal accompaniment. This is as opposed to the chord symbols that you probably find everywhere else than where the N.C. notation is. See for example
http://dictionary.onmusic.org/terms/2344-no_chord

Best ways of storing sheet music,"Storage: I'm going to focus on storage for the average musician's collection of music, not the music of a collector who keeps valuable manuscripts. When I am storing music, the most important considerations are that 1) I don't damage the music, and 2) that I can find the particular music I need with ease, and 3) That I'm not wasting space. Books of music can often be stored on an everyday bookshelf, if you have tall shelves. I've found most music is just about as deep as my shelves. This is a good cheap option if you are on a budget. Use bookends to keep the music from sagging sideways and bending if the shelf isn't full. File cabinets are better for loose sheet music, but you may need to put the music in the cabinet the long way if it doesn't fit across the cabinet's shorter dimension. Put the music in correctly labeled file folders. If the cabinet isn't very full, the music will tend to bend if the file folders spread out. You can buy blocks to keep the folders from sliding to far: they work a lot like bookends.  The problem with bookshelves and file cabinets is that most music doesn't have the name written down the spine - it's too narrow. To fix this, you generally need to make custom labels. File folder labels, or a piece of cardboard about an inch deeper than the music will solve the problem. Stick the cardboard in the shelf between the music at the start of a new composer, and write the composer's name on the end. Then you get music of extra large dimensions, that sticks way past the edge of your bookshelf, or requires such extra long folders that it doesn't fit in the same cabinet at your other music. You can buy dedicated music cabinets that will fit even large music manuscripts, but if money or space is important, it may be easiest to stack this in a box on top of a filing cabinet, or top of a bookshelf, where it won't be easily damaged. Organization: If you've got a lot of music, being able to find a particular piece is an important part of storage. For me, I separate music out by instrument, and then arrange it alphabetically, either by composer or title, whichever is more memorable. (Vivaldi's Gloria is under V for Vivaldi, but the pop song Four Leaf Clover is under F for Four.  It means that I can find all my music by looking in only two or three possible locations.  Not having any organization means searching through a foot high stack of sheet music, or worse if you've got more. Valuable Music: If you are worried about making the music last as long as possible (you've got an original, handwritten Mozart composition, for example), you'll want to store it in a dry, climate controlled space, out of direct sunlight or darker, and minimize the contact of your skin with it as much as possible.

How to train recognizing chords by ear ?,"MusicTheory.net has a flash application to practice chord recognition. It doesn't go into more complex chords like 7#9, but it presents 10 chords (typical four-note chords and triads). That's a starting point. There must be applications supporting more ""advanced"" chords but I'm not aware of them, so I typically end up programming my own."
Can one be too old to learn an instrument?,"Certainly children learn more quickly than adults, particularly when it comes to languages, and to skills.  (That is, ""proficiency, facility, or dexterity that is acquired or developed through training or experience."") As a former US Figure Skating Basic Skills instructor, I observed this effect time and again when teaching school-age children as compared with teaching adults.  (It's a skill that requires both physical learning and mental understanding, and practice, similar to musicianship.) And it is well-documented that as we progress through our 30's, 40's, 50's, and upward, our learning rate decreases.  (why-learning-is-harder-as-we-get-older) However, there is absolutely no reason to avoid learning a new instrument in your 20's.  In my own personal experience, I started learning ""pop"" organ at age 11, and studied viola from ages 15 through 18.  Then -- having taken no musical lessons of any kind for 30 years -- I started studying piano at age 48, and found it enjoyable and not terribly difficult. In both my experience teaching skills to others (figure skating and a couple of other skills), and in my experience as a music student, learning as an adult is
different than learning as a child, but not necessarily worse: As a child, you may have more time available to practice, though this is not a hard-and-fast rule. As an adult, you are likely to be more focused and more motivated in your practice and your study.  You are better able to understand the need for boring things such as drills, and better able to master your own feelings and attitudes.  Adults ""buckle down"" better than children do. As a child, you do learn more quickly. As an adult, you may tend to value what you're learning more, and may retain it better. As a child, you approach things with fewer preconceived notions, and are likelier to accept things at face value.  (I saw this all the time teaching children to skate, particularly when teaching the beginnings of jumping skills.) As an adult, you are more capable of analysis: both of what the teacher is saying and of what you yourself are doing.  Some examples: Teaching adults proper skating posture was far easier than teaching children.  I could draw word pictures involving imaginary lines through parts of the body, and the adults could translate that into actions and posture.  I had to physically bend the children into the shapes I wanted -- repeatedly -- before they could successfully reproduce the instructions.  Then they would revert and have to be taught again, whereas adults only required a simple verbal reminder. Learning aspects of musical theory was far easier for me as an adult than as a child.  As a child, I understood that an E-flat was the same as a D-sharp, so ""who cares what you call it.""  As an adult, I could see why the key of the composition affected the names (or identities) of the notes. As an adult musical student, I'm able to analyze my own playing and state ""___ is the right way to finger this, but my pinky finger on my right hand will always be weak due to a childhood injury, so I'm deliberately [incorrectly] doubling it up with my right ring finger so I'm able to strike a high note with particular force when needed."" As an adult, you are better capable of evaluating whether a particular teacher/instructor is the ""right"" one for you. As an adult, you have much better proprioception than you did as child or even as a teen.  For example, you should be able to learn the distances between frets (and strings) without looking, and learn it more quickly.  As an adult, you've also done most of your growing, and your fingers are capable of being stronger than they were as a teen.  If you are like me, you are also better able to ignore pain while developing calluses for playing. The size of your hands may be another matter entirely.  You may need to consider getting a 3/4 or 2/4 guitar, or switching to something smaller, such as the mandolin.
Not everyone is suited for every instrument.  For example, I tried playing saxophone in 6th and 7th grades.  I had trouble controlling my breathing, and I never could really learn the fingering well enough: there's no real pattern to it (it's dictated by physics).  So, while I love listening to the sax, it's not the instrument for me. I hope these observations serve to encourage you to continue your musical education.  Learn any instrument you want, at any age you want!"
How to avoid stopping when I play a wrong note on the piano,"The most common cause I've encountered for this kind or problem is practicing primarily from the beginning a piece. Beginners tend to learn music by developing muscle memory that is associated with the sounds of that music. When the sound or the muscle memory is interrupted, the performer becomes lost. There are no other memory sources (e.g., knowing each individual note, the harmonies, being able to play by ear) to back things up. Thus, the music must be restarted from the very beginning. It's similar to traveling to a familiar location when one always starts and end the trip from the same places. If there's a different starting place, or a wrong turn, or the familiar trip is somehow interrupted, one becomes lost unless there's good enough knowledge of what went wrong, the surrounding area, or some other cue to help get back on track. The starting point to fixing this kind of problem is to practice starting from different places in the music — first with the sheet to help, then from memory. Suppose a mistake occurs at measure X. First, practice measure X by itself. Then start one measure before. Then start at the beginning of the phrase. Try starting in the middle of a random spot near X. This will force your mind, ear, and fingers to learn to music from many different perspectives, and when done sufficiently, will carry you through even when mistakes are made. In addition to the ""mechanical"" practice described above, there is also the musical/emotional meaning of the piece. Mistakes — and the difficultly in continuing past them — often stem from an incomplete connection with the feeling of the music. When a mistake occurs, it is crucial, beyond just drilling the notes, to ask what those notes mean. What is happening in the phrase of which they're a part? Is it climactic? Tragic? Exciting? Is there a specific image or story involved? And what role does this note, chord, or passage play within that meaning? Is it the high point? A rest point? A passing-through point? These kinds of emotional ""through-lines"" in music can carry us along even when ""surface detail"" (like notes, rhythms, dynamics, etc.) eludes us. Consider that when you speak, you can forget a word, use the wrong word, stumble, forget what you were saying, and the person you're talking to still gets your meaning, because they have a feel for what you were saying. Music is the same. Capture the feel, and know ""the story"" of the music, and that will sustain you through missed notes."
How to help students remember Half vs. Whole rests,There was a trick for these that I used all the time based on what the rests look like. The whole rest looks like a hole. The words sound the same so it's a good way to equate them.  The half rest looks like a hat and since hat and half both start with the letter 'h' they go together.  I like this trick a lot because it associates the rests more with objects that are very distinguishable a it's little more fun to ask if the rest is a hat or a hole then if it's a half or whole.
Truth behind Mozart memorizing Miserere and then writing it down later in full,"Neuroscience still can't explain some of the amazing things human brains can do.  A person alive in our time has interesting and similar ability to mentally manage music in a way that suggests that some people might be wired for this sort of thing. The study detailed at http://www.radiolab.org/story/148670-4-track-mind/ showed that Bob Milne has the ability to mentally play up to four symphonies in his head simultaneously.  Early in his career he didn't use or need sheet music - he could listen to someone play a piece, then play it back in complete. So to be specific: Is this really possible? Yes.  It's a rare ability, but there are those that can memorize a long song with one listening session, and repeat it themselves or copy it to sheet music. how exactly does one achieve this ability? Lots of practice would probably do it. Start with short one hand pieces, then lengthen them, then add more voices.  There are many techniques for memorization.  Some will find it easier, some harder, depending on skills and talents they've already developed in their life, but I don't think there's any specific reason why one couldn't train their brain for this type of work."
Are there any instruments that don't produce overtones?,"A tuning fork comes close, though amplifying it by placing it on some resonating object - a wooden table, piano case, or try your head :-) - will add some harmonics. The sound-producing element of a Fender Rhodes electric piano is essentially a tuning fork, though other parts of the instrument are designed to 'dirty up' the pure tone. The tone of a flute, especially in the higher register, is close to a sine wave. Note that we're talking about the sustain portion of a note.  Both tuning fork and flute produce much more complex sounds as a note is attacked.   You could mistake a tuning fork for a flute if the attack portion of a note was chopped off. I don't think you'd confuse the two if the attack was also heard though! This principle was put to good use in 'Hybrid Synthesisers' like the Roland D50 or Yamaha SY range.  A short sampled attack was followed by a synthesised sustain and release.  It combined a remarkable degree of realism and controllability with economical use of sample memory. So your answer is: although some instruments have a sustain close to a sine wave, I can't think of one outside the test bench that lacks a more complex attack."
"When we press a piano key, why does a high pitch note not run for as long as a low pitch note?","That's true not only for pianos, but for every instrument where a string is plucked, and the reason is basic physics. When you hammer a string with a piano key, or pick it with your finger, or with a pick, etc. you impart a certain amount of energy to it, depending on how hard you hit it -- the harder you hit it, the more energy you give it. Next, you should know that given the same amplitude of vibration, higher frequencies contain more energy than lower frequencies (the string vibrates more often in the same amount of time). Therefore, if you impart the same energy to two different strings (or to the same string with different lengths), the string that vibrates at a higher frequency will dissipate the energy faster (higher frequency requires more energy) while the same energy on a lower frequency string will dissipate less energy in the same amount of time, and therefore the sound will last longer. In other words, the total amount of energy dissipated will be the same, but a higher pitched string will dissipate it faster (and therefore last a shorter time) while a lower pitched string will dissipate its energy more slowly and therefore last a longer time. You can easily test it on a guitar: choose any string, and the first pluck the open string, and let it play. Then fret the string at the highest fret, pluck it with the same force, and note how long that plays. The difference should be pretty obvious."
What are some of the components of a good guitar solo?,"I have always viewed the rock/pop type guitar solo as being all about tension and release. You want to build to a climax, with any combination of speed and phrasing and note choices that fall slightly outside the chord structure, and then release that tension by resolving to something that is central to the song's melody or at least the chord changes that you're playing over. I know a lot of people harp on Phish for being somewhat indulgent in their solo breaks, but there's a lot be learned from listening to one of their better jams when it comes to crafting a great build followed by a release that puts the listener back on melody and grounds them back in the original song again. Trey's solos tend to start with some fairly in-the-pocket melody lines, usually repeating a common vocal melody. Nothing challenging on the ears, all the notes fairly consonant. And then he introduces bends and quick notes that go ""outside"" the key -- stuff that hangs, dissonant, in the air for a short time, before returning to things that are in key, on melody. He'll keep building on this approach throughout a solo, going ""outside"" more and more for longer periods of notes, and then bringing it back to something in key. Working his way up to neck to the higher register, adding more notes to the phrases being played. And when the solo is going to resolve the whole band will come back to something that's on theme, everything in key, and it'll just feel good on your ears. Tension, release."
Piano with two treble clefs and 8va on grand staff,You are ignoring the dotted line with 8va written above the upper G-clef. This means that the notes written in this clef should be played an octave above the written notes. (This notation is called All'ottava and is sometimes used to avoid ledger lines.) When you do this there is no conflict between the notes in the red box.
Why is there a key signature if I never play those notes?,"Without the key signature it looks confusing and wrong to musicians who are used to reading music in context, instead of just treating sheet music as a ""play by numbers"" game. It looks like C major, but the notes are mostly confined to the GABCD range, and the theme ends on G. Indeed, an F note will indeed occur in harmonizations of the theme. For instance the V chord in G major is a D, which contains the F# (D F# A). Some musicians can harmonize without having the notes spelled out in the sheet music; it helps them to know from the outset that the key is G. That key signature clue instantly connects in their minds to a scale pattern on the instrument, from which chords emerge."
What chord is formed by the open strings of a guitar in standard (EADGBe) tuning?,"It's a mantra of mine that a given chord (or chord name) only properly exists in the context of a specific chord progression. Thus, the name you give to the chord formed by the 6 open strings of the guitar depends on what key and mode you use this chord in. It might have one name if used in the key of A major, another name if used in the key of E minor, and so forth. And thus it is with all complex chords that go beyond the basic major and minor triads. I think guitarists get entirely too hung up on giving a name to a particular grouping of notes that are strummed together. The individual pitches are what they are, but the name of the chord depends on how those pitches are being used at the time."
What is Voice Leading?,"The term ""voice leading"" comes from choral music, but it applies to chord progressions in all sorts of arrangements for all sorts of instruments. A chord progression has two dimensions: horizontal and vertical. Let's say you are playing four-note chords in sequence. You can think of the progression as a series of block chords (vertical), but you can also think of it as four independent musical instruments (horizontal), which play one note at a time, playing four different melodies which line up to make the chords. So voice leading is the process of writing four melodies which are smooth and logical and easy to sing or play, in the service of creating the chord progression.  For example, if you were to compose a melody with a certain chord progression, and arrange three singing voices beneath the melody to flesh out the chords, you would usually not want the melodic lines of the three singing voices to have to jump around across awkward wide intervals from one note to the next. So you would try to follow the rules of voice leading outlined in classical music theory, to produce smooth, musical lines. Here is a rough example I have created from a Bach chorale. You might think of this piano part as a series of chords:  However, it is also four melodies sung simultaneously, using voice leading:  Orchestral composers think about voice leading. Pianists who improvise in jazz pay attention to voice leading, which you can think of as how to play a chord progression with the least amount of changes in hand position and the smoothest fingering patterns.  Unfortunately, due to the nature of the relationship of the pitches on the six strings of the guitar, the concept of voice leading is very hard to implement on guitar, and most guitarists don't get around to working with the concept. Guitarists, in contrast to piano players, tend to think of chords as certain block shapes that they memorize, and they give little thought as to creating different inversions and voicings of chords that would create a smoother voice leading in a chord progression."
When practicing on my instrument - which is more important - quantity or quality?,"Wrong reps create wrong results.  DO NOT play fast and wrong.  Practice as slowly as you need to to avoid wrong notes.  This is very important.   The reason that you need to practice in the first place is that you need to create muscle memory.  If you tell your muscles to do the wrong thing they will remember to do the wrong thing.  Every instance of sloppy, inaccurate, and ultimately dissatisfying performance in my personal experience (and I have plenty of those) comes from being in too much of a hurry to learn something, and so never playing slowly enough to be accurate. I often ask my students how fast a piece should go.  Generally the answers boil down to some version of ""faster than I can play it"".  The answer to that question should always be ""as fast as I play it""!  It takes a certain talent to recognize that.  (Of course, if you're playing with other people, the answer is ""as fast as WE play it"" but the principle is the same.) In your case, your question really boils down to being anxious about whether you can learn to play it ""full speed"" in the time you have available to prepare.  I can guarantee you that your fingers will remember every few notes that you miss, and faithfully reproduce them for you when you get to the point of performance.  This is especially true when you get in extra reps of those few wrong notes by playing fast enough to not pay attention to them.  Music is unforgiving that way.  So, if you want to make the best of the time you have, then take the time you need to get the notes right.  Practice slowly enough to get the notes right, don't slow down in difficult spots and speed up in easier ones.   Also, never, ever (never ever) practice with the goal of just getting the notes right.  There is music in every note no matter what tempo you're using.  Your job as a musician is to find it (that means NOW, not once you get the notes).  If you do not find it, the best you can create is empty virtuosity."
With modern electronic technology is temperament unnecessary?,"In principle, the answer is yes, with software instruments it is feasible to (re-)set the tuning so that you can realize music with modulation that stays in just intonation across these changes.  The frequencies are directly accessible in sound synthesis environments like PureData or Overtone, and even just by setting the tuning information in a set of MIDI data. The main issue is deciding how/when/where to use which frequency for a given key on the keyboard.  For standard keyboards, there is the base ambiguity between enharmonic notes: obviously between C sharp and D flat, which have different frequencies in JI, and less obviously between C double-sharp and D (and so on).  In 5 limit JI there is an additional 2 fold ambiguity for a note of a given name!  The D that is a third above B-flat (B-flat is 2 fifths below C) is tuned differently than the D that is two fifths above C.  This issue is alluded to in @ttw and @Todd answers: for even moderately complex music, making just intonated chords would require on-the-fly decisions about how to assign frequencies to the notes.  To date, no automated software system has enough ""understanding"" of musical context to do this at all, let alone in real time.  In sequenced music, it is possible for the composer to assign these frequencies, but then they're already approaching their composition from a point of view that significantly diverges from common practice harmony. A quick search resulted in a video that involved changing the root tone of the just intonation to the septimal seventh. I'm sure that many other people have experimented with these capabilities, but it's not something that has, in my perspective, taken off.  I suspect that something like the following is going on:  If I have the desire and power to reset the frequencies of all of my sounds at will, and I'm not trying to recreate conventional sounds (as Todd pointed out, synthesized sounds always sound synthesized) I can do much more novel, or extreme, things than just modulate in the conventional ways of classical music.  To summarize, yes software synths (of various sorts) in principle allow you to realize harmonically complex music in just intonation. particularly for seqeuenced music.  For actual performance with a keyboard, the complexities involved in dynamically modifying the frequencies hard to address: it is too much for the performer to tweak the intonation on the fly (though this kind of keyboard might help), and automated support is not yet available.  The prospects for sequenced music are more promising, but still, for conventional harmonic music the effort to benefit ratio is pretty low:  you have to construct a complex system that goes beyond current standards to specific which frequencies you mean, and the problem of creating ""good sounding"" harmonic music  is already reasonably well solved by other temperaments.  It's only when you go to more extreme experimental music that exploiting this fine level of control gives you bang for the buck, but then you've moved beyond conventional harmonic practice altogether. Note: this answer assumes that you're considering music that ""sounds synthesized"", getting an organic feel to the music would require better (more authentic) intrinsic sound generation capabilities, and an ability to realize expressive intonation."
How can I keep learning new songs and not forget the previous ones?,"This is a question without a single, solve-everything answer. There are a number of different approaches you can take, and different people will have their own preferences. Fake it. This works well in some traditional music, bluegrass, rock,
   or jazz, where a certain amount of improvisation is expected of a
   musician. With a song you haven’t played in quite a while,    you won’t be able
to play your best, most stand-out version, but if    you know the
melody and chord structure, you can hit most of the    correct notes,
and fudge or fake what you can’t quite remember. The    better your
overall musicianship, the better quality this on-the-fly version will
be. To practice this sort of faking, play songs you
      don’t know well, and instead of stopping to polish each single
      piece, make a note of the sort of things you messed up most badly on
      several pieces. Then practice those aspects on a variety of songs.
      For instance, if you kept playing the wrong chords, work on figuring
      out chord structure on the fly, rather than on memorizing the chords
      in each song. Learn patterns.  If you know a hundred common songs, they    probably don’t have a
hundred different chord structures. If you can    remember one song,
and then learn a similar sounding one, it’s    easier to remember a
few key differences than to relearn everything    hat’s the same
about them.  Sometimes, the same is true of melodies. For remembering melodies, learn to recognize common melodic
building blocks. Simplest are scales and arpeggios. Then start
listening for common variations that show up in lots of pieces. Slow down."
Is there a name for this famous “memeish” rhythm?,"The ""Shave and a haircut — two bits"" rhythm... ...goes back at least to Charles Hale in 1899 according to Where does this famous rhythm pattern come from (oftenly used to knock on a door)?, which references Wikipedia: Shave and a Haircut. The history is well described in the linked MusicFans.SE post; so, this being MusicPerformanceAndTheory.SE... All three of the notations in the OP are correct; there is no canonical notation, just a set of rhythmic relationships, all of which are expressed. The eighth notes (or sixteenth notes: i.e., ""and a"") can be played straight or swung. The traditional/characteristic ""melody"" is... ...or sometimes... ...and also... The final rest is sometimes replaced with a ""stinger"" — an instrumental accent to end a piece."
"Randomly and Programmatically generate a ""good"" next chord?","There are several ""chord maps"" on the net which indicate chord successions; these may be a good starting point. The chord maps do not give any relative weights or probabilities to chords. A simple Markov Chain also makes a good model (but very limited.) The idea is to randomly (with indicated probabilities) generate the probability of a chord succession. Trivial version: This transition matrix may be expanded; it's too short-sighted (only on3 chord back) to generate anything that sounds good. One could make a two- (or more) step system but that quickly gets big (not hard to program, just tedious). Again, it doesn't capture long-range functions. I've tried (but not very seriously) a Markov Chain with side information (V -> I gets more probable as the length of the chain increases).  Other side information may be used for long-range patterns. As pointed out in other answers, some stock movements (I -> ii6 -V7) may be chunked and treated as a single object (as could ii0-I64-V7-I or the like). There are many papers on the subject. One can search Google Scholar to find interesting stuff."
Why do electric guitars have narrow necks?,"For styles of music that predominantly depend upon playing solos and melodies with a pick, guitarist prefer guitars with narrow necks. For styles of music that predominantly depend on strumming chords with a pick, and using lots of barré chords, guitarists prefer instruments with necks of intermediate width. For styles of music that involve intricate counterpoint (more than one musical line being played on the guitar at the same time) and playing with several fingers rather than with a pick, guitarists prefer very wide necks.  Traditional classical, nylon string guitars have a nut width of 52mm, the widest width you can usually find, because classical guitar music requires very intricate fingering work for both hands. You need the extra space between strings to play that style of music, and classical guitar music rarely involves things like barré chords. Various options are available among different kinds of guitars. Neck widths at the nut (the end of the neck near the headstock) for six-string guitars vary between about 39mm and 54mm, which, to a guitarist, is a huge variation. Also, guitars vary in the width of the string spacing at the opposite end, at the bridge. Generally a guitar with a wider nut will have a proportionally wider bridge spacing, but there are variations among the many types of guitars on the market. Selecting a guitar with a nut width and string spacing that suits your style of playing is something worth thinking about, at least for an intermediate or advanced guitarist. There's another factor that varies with different kinds of guitars, the fingerboard radius.   Classical guitars have a completely flat fingerboard (no radius at all), which works well for that style of music -- intricate fingering, where you don't strum chords much at all. (I find that trying to play barré chords on a classical guitar is quite uncomfortable and fatiguing to the hand.) Fender electric guitars, traditionally, have a pronounced curve to the fingerboard (7-1/2 inches or 190mm) that makes it really comfortable to play barré chords.  Most Gibson electric guitars traditionally had less curvature to the fingerboard, with a radius of 12 inches or 300mm, which seems to be more comfortable for playing solos and for bending strings.  Acoustic steel-string guitars usually have even less curvature to the fingerboard (around 15 inches or 380mm).  A recent development in electric guitars is the compound radius, where the surface of the fingerboard is a section of a cone, to use the geometrical term. At the nut end of the neck, the curve is prounounced, but the curve of the fingerboard gradually flattens to less of a curve as you move up the neck. The idea behind this is to have the ""best of all worlds"" to make it a bit more comfortable to play many styles of guitar on one instrument.  (In this illustration the amount of curvature is greatly exaggerated for effect)"
What is the full list of possible chord names? Are there chords that don't have a name in chord theory?,"Well, a musical chord is by definition a collection of two or more notes sounding simultaneously. So, mathematically, in the usually used 12-tone pitch system of Western/pop/jazz music, there are 2^11 - 1 = 2047 different possible combinations of pitch classes modulo transposition (2^11 is the number of ways additional tones can be added once you fix a root note; subtracting one because a note by itself does not a chord make). Of course, most of them are not usually used in music, as smacking every key down on a piano generally sound quite unmusical, and so I doubt if anyone has bothered to give a name to the, say, CM7 #9 b9 11 #11 b13 #13 chord. (In other words, there definitely a chords that exists in principle but not 'named' just because noone uses them.) But a list of 35 is very short of complete. Any two-note interval is by (some) definition a chord, so there's 11 right there. Between the commonly used tritones, 7th, 11th, and 13th chords, Wikipedia lists, if I count correctly, 41, which only includes 11th and 13th chords based on usual diatonic scales. If you include alterations you will get a lot more.  Now, for some of your examples: Now, in regards of your programming exercise: the same set of notes can often be mapped into voicings of many different chords. For example, if a guitar were to play the Db A C Gb, and the bass a Db or an A, one would tend to think of it as the augmented-major 11th over Db. But if the bass were to play a Bb or an F, then the chord should be interpreted as Bb Db F A C Eb Gb which would be the Bb minor-major 11 with a flat 13. In the context of a small combo, I should imagine that this would makes more sense for the voicing, as it picks out the 3rd, 7th, 9th, and 13th of the chord, adding basically pure colour.  You may also be interested in the chord-scale system. "
How to unlearn incorrect muscle memory,"Very down-to-earth and an answer from experience, play the piece really slowly and correctly. It might be really irritating and boring. But do it at least twenty times correctly. Then slowly increase the tempo little by little. Your muscles will automatically overwrite its memory A common misconception is that practicing a piece at a high tempo will make you learn faster. That is false. Once you learn to play a piece fast, you will find it tough to play it slowly, but vice versa is not true. If you practice the piece really slowly, you will never learn the wrong things, and playing fast soon becomes really really easy. As I said, practicing slowly is really irritating and you might even, sometimes lose your marbles and hate the piece itself. (Experience: Like how I hated Moonlight Sonata while practicing it but even if you ask me to play it with my eyes closed, I can:D) “I hated every minute of training, but I said, 'Don't quit. Suffer now and live the rest of your life as a champion.""- Muhammed Ali"
Why do frets get closer as the notes get higher?,"This is more clear when you think of it in terms of the length of the string.  Ignoring for a second that strings need to be a minimum length in order to vibrate, we can produce a full octave on the first half of any length of string.  Open for the ""base"" note, midpoint for the octave, one third of the way up for the fifth, etc. So on a guitar you have the first half of the string to make up an octave.  Then on the second half, you have another half of that (a quarter) to make up the next octave.  Then another half of a half of a half (eighth) to make the next octave.  Each time, you only have half the space for the octave.  Thus, each fret has to be half the size of the fret an octave lower. This mirrors my comment above: While maintaining frequency ratios, the absolute frequency differences changes by a factor of 2, and that is represented in the physical frets as well."
Did baroque composers think of ritardando on their compositions?,"Baroque music was all about expressiveness, and the rhythm was not necessarily meant to be held as strictly as the Renaissance tactus. Wheat Williams has mentioned historically informed performance, and as he says, these things are debated academically. But there is some good indication that Baroque composers did think of slowing down at the end of pieces. In fact, it is often explicitly notated with an Adagio over the last few bars of a movement. You see this especially frequently in Handel and Corelli, especially in sonatas and concerti. A similar use of adagio occurs towards the end of the 3rd movement of Bach's Brandenberg Concerto No. 1, followed by an ""a tempo"" with the recapitulation of the main theme. Aside from the use of ""adagio"" (or often, in tandem with it), you'll also see places where there is a fermata placed on a half-cadence a few bars before the end, which is followed by one or more rests (during which a cadenza may be improvised) and finally the close of the original phrase. Another way in which ritardandos could occasionally be notated was by actually using longer note values. In triple time, this frequently involved a so-called hemiola at the cadence. Turning to documented sources, I found Robert Donington's ""Baroque Music: Style and Performance : a Handbook"" (1982) on Google books, which has a section on ""Flexibility in Baroque Tempo"". No doubt there has been much research in the intervening 30+ years, but even here, he quotes multiple sources as requiring liberties to be taken with the tempo -- sometimes faster, and sometimes slower -- as determined by the taste of the performer. He quotes Frescobaldi as saying: Cadences... are properly to be very much drawn out... Jean Rousseau said that: there are people who imagine that imparting the movement is to follow and keep time; but these are very different matters. Quantz is quoted as saying: the performance should be easy and flexible... A few pages later, there is a section titled ""Notated Rallentandos"", where he mentions a piece by Locke in 1675 that explicitly instructs ""soft and slow by degrees"" and discusses the use of ""adagio"" at the end of a movement (which I already mention above). He claims these types of instructions were used when a greater-than-usual slowing affect was desired, because ""It was not... usually thought necessary to indicate anything so musically obvious."" He further claims that ending a piece without such a slowing ""is a special and not normal affect."" Here's an example from Handel's Concerto Grosso, Op. 6, No. 2, Movement I (Andante larghetto) which utilizes a number of these techniques at once. You see a fermata (on a first inversion vii dim!), followed by a brief pause and resumption of the phrase, followed by an adagio, and finally ended with a dotted figure that uses note values twice as long as the preceding figures. This is not to say that every Baroque piece ends with such a dramatic coda, but rather to show that the concept of slowing down at the end of a piece was very much a familiar Baroque gesture, even without the use of the term ""ritardando"". The relevant section starts about 2:47 in this video.

Why do harmonics played on guitar sound lower as you move to higher frets while fretted notes sound higher?,"It is not true in general that the higher you go on the fret board, the lower your harmonic is. Actually, if your were to play an harmonic at the 24th fret, you would hear a note sounding an octave higher than the harmonic at the 12th. Still, however, the harmonics behave differently than fretted notes. Now, let’s get physical and explain why. On perfect strings fixed on both extremities. Because its extremities are fixed, a perfect string of length L can only vibrate at certain frequencies. These frequencies are such that the matching wavelength are of the form: λn = 2⨉L/n The next image1 illustrates why: the extremities don’t move, so must be on nodes of the vibrating strings.  The matching frequencies for these wavelength are: fn = k⨉n/(2⨉L) for a some constant k which depends on the characteristics of the string. In practice, whenever a string vibrates, it vibrates at a combination of these frequencies. f1 is the fundamental, which determines the note you hear, the various fn≥1 are the harmonics, which are multiples of the fundamental and create the timbre of the note. Remember that the higher the frequency, the higher the pitch. Whenever you fret a note, what happens is that, without changing the other characteristics of the string2, you change its length; i.e. instead of having fixed points at the bridge and the head, you have fixed points at the bridge and the fret. The fundamental frequency of the note you’re playing is thus: fʹ1 = k/(2⨉Lʹ) where Lʹ is the length of the string up to the fret you’re playing. Because, obviously, Lʹ < L, fʹ > f. The fundamental frequency is higher, the note has a higher pitch. When you graze a string to “play a harmonic”, what happens is very different. You don’t shorten the length of the string: the whole string is still vibrating. However, you muffle some of the frequencies it’s vibrating at by preventing mouvement at a given point. For example, if you play a harmonic on the 12th fret, that is in the very middle of the string, you muffle every alternate frequency. If you look back to the previous illustration, you can see that the frequencies depicted on the right-hand side of the image don’t make the string move in its very middle, but that the ones on the left-hand side all do. But if your finger is right there, the middle of the string cannot move. That means that the only frequencies you allow to vibrate are the fn where n is even, f2, f4, … The lowest frequency at which the string is vibrating is thus f2, which is the fundamental of the note you’re grazing. The fundamental is twice as high as the open string; you’re playing an octave. If you were to graze the string at one quarter of its length, be it the first (~5th fret) or last fourth (exactly the 24th fret) of the string, you would only allow one out of four frequencies to be vibrate. The fundamental would be f4, that is two octaves above the open string. If you were to graze the string at a third of its length, once again which third does not matter (the first is around the 7th fret), only one frequency out of three would vibrate and the fundamental would be f3, i.e. an octave and a perfect fifth above the open string. You could theoretically play any note with fn as a fundamental this way, but higher harmonics have very little power. Should be left as an exercice for the reader. I’m way too nice. We have said previously that a 12th fret harmonic sounds one octave higher than the open string, i.e. its frequency is double that of the open string. Now, when you fret a note on the same fret, the length of the string is Lʹ = L/2 (we’re at the middle of the string). Thus, when you fret this note, the fundamental is: fʹ1 = k/(2⨉Lʹ) = k/(2⨉Lʹ) = k/L = 2⨉k/(2⨉L) = 2⨉f1 = f2 The fretted note is, once again, at the octave and share the same fundamental (and thus pitch) as the harmonic. Please notice, however, that while the frequencies are the same, the power at which the string vibrates for each frequency is different. The pitch is the same; the timbre is different. Typically, harmonics are much softer."
How to modulate very smoothly and stealthily from major to minor?,"Within a minimalist sort of setting, one approach I might take would be to boil things down to just the root or root and fifth.  If you have a long enough period of time where you don't have a third in the mix, your ear won't be glued to a given tonality and introducing the minor flavor into the mix shouldn't sound as abrupt.  You can also start adding in the b7 of the original key before hitting the Eb.  Since there is a major mode that has a b7 (Mixolydian), that is the only note that is present in the minor modes that is common with any major modes. I'm not familiar with Arvo-Pärtesque to be able to say whether or not this approach would be great in that context or not."
Stage volume levels in rehearsal and performance,"This is common for mainly two reasons: The solution: Wear ear plugs, use in ears, or just live with it. Chances are you can't change these people. If you feel you can then try to reason when them. The situation is very difficult though, specially if people share monitors. About the best you can do is get in ears or at least individual wedges, each with individual mixing controls(See personal monitor mixes). Personal monitor mixers are the way to go because it allows each person to adjust their own mix. Most musicians do not have a good enough knowledge to know that X, Y, and Z are too loud and they should play quieter. Most of the time the bass player wants more bass, the guitarist more guitar, and the vocalists want more of their own vocals. The drummer is just beating the drums as hard as he can, regardless. What makes a great band is when everyone plays together as one. If they can't hear you, then it means they must all play quieter assuming you actually have a decent level of volume...  It only takes one person to screw up everything. If he is playing too loud, each other person will not be able to hear themselves and play harder or turn up resulting in a cycle until it's just noise. If your drummer is playing acoustic drums then it is near impossible to practice or even do small gigs if he doesn't realize how much he is hurting the music by playing too hard. Not only does it cause the problem you are having but also you lose dynamics. If you can't talk to these guys about it and reason with them then best I can say is find a better band... cause it won't get any better and you'll probably just end up deaf(which only contributes to the problem). If you like playing at a low volume and they don't then you are not compatible with them, find a group of guys that you are compatible with and you'll have more fun. Not only will you be able to enjoy the music better you'll also progress better (you'll hear more of the music and less of the noise (distortion, room reflections, etc...). Since this happens exponentially, everyone will improve. (i.e., not only will you hear better everyone else will too) Note that having less volume does lose some energy as obviously there is more energy in loud music. This is where having a proper setup comes into play. You can have some of the energy without the noise and deafening levels. (EQ is a big part of this. e.g., EQ the kick and snare so they don't contribute useless noise to the spectrum which will muddy it up making it harder to hear other instruments."
"With regards to piano sheet music, when are you supposed to press the pedal(s)?","Your digital piano is equipped with a damper, or ""sustain"" pedal. When depressed, notes will continue to ring until the pedal is released or they fade away on their own. Without the pedal, notes will only ring as long as you hold down the key. If we had 88 fingers, we wouldn't need the sustain pedal because we could control each note's sustain individually with the key. [Yes, I know this is an oversimplification.] However, music is often written such that certain notes or passages (more than we have fingers for at one time) should ring out until we reach a point; usually a chord change. The short answer is you should hold down the pedal whenever you want your notes to sustain, and release it whenever you want them to stop. To learn when the notes SHOULD sustain, your suspicion about the Ped. and * symbols are correct: 'Ped.' signifies you should press and hold the pedal, and '*' signifies it should be released. You may also see an upwards-facing bracket underneath the bottom staff with upside-down 'V's along it, signifying that the pedal should be quickly released and repedaled at those points. You will eventually use your musical intuition in addition to notation to figure this out. Take Debussy's Arabesque No. 1, for example. This piece is typically bathed in pedal, but the edition will generally not explicitly define it. Say you had some [bigchord]s, one after another, all different. You need to lift your hands from the keys of the first [bigchord] to set up for the next [bigchord], but doing so would cause the sound to stop while your hands are off the keys, and you want these [bigchord]s to connect (perhaps they are under a slur or legato 'arc'). You would depress the pedal in time to hit the first [bigchord], lift your hands to set up for the next [bigchord] (while the first is still ringing under the pedal), then release the pedal right as you play the next [bigchord], with your hands; repedaling before you release the hands from the keyboard to play the next [bigchord]. This sequence of resetting the pedal at the press of each chord is quite common. On a real piano, each repetition of this would be lowering the dampers to the strings briefly, in effect ""canceling"" the set of harmonies that was ringing from the previous chord in time to play the next chord. If you had just held down the pedal through the entire sequence, each subsequent chord would add dissonance to the notes of the first chord that are still sustaining. Notes of different chords typically clash with one another in a typical tonal context. Not playing staccato does not imply legato. Staccato simply asks for space by shortening the note in question. A note with neither an arc or dot is just a note of its full rhythmic value. Notes under an arc, legato, are specifically meant to be connected. In a single line, this may mean each note blends into the last one before it is released. With chords, this typically requires use of a pedal to sustain the sound before each articulation. At the end of the day, listen to lots of classical piano recordings, experiment with your instrument until you have an understanding of how it works, and then do what sounds right."
How to make ASIO work with multiple programs simultaneously : how can I listen to Guitar Rig plus something else through the same interface?,"Important note This answer is now obsolete. FlexASIO seems to be the current solution. I think I know where is the issue. My Windows-fu is rusty, but here is what I found. Solution, in short  Get ASIO multi-client from here or here (they are different, you might want to try both). After installation you should be able to use your interface with more than one program. What is happening? Seems that ASIO in general (including ASIO4ALL) can't handle more than one program using one same output.  Support for using ASIO with multiple programs at once. Previously, if you were using an ASIO driver
  (so that you have low latency), you could only use ASIO with one program at a time. Now you can use
  multiple programs at once with ASIO - for example RealBand and Band-in-a-Box at the same time.  Steinberg solved this by creating an ASIO multi-client server that you need to download and install. Seems that this is exactly what you need, and seems to work with all ASIO capable interfaces. More info: http://www.pgmusic.com/forums/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=237170 There are other ASIO multi-client drivers you can try, like this one: http://vidance.com/asiomulti/asiomulti.html From the above, we discover that: ASIO (Audio Streaming Input Output) is a technology of Steinberg. 
    It allows for low latencies and pretty much every state-of-the-art 
    audio device is nowadays delivered with an ASIO driver 
    (on Windows, at least). However, the basic idea behind ASIO is 
    that professional audio applications entirely take ownership of 
    the ASIO device. 
    Only very few ASIO drivers support true multiple application 
    access. This effectively means that you can not use 2 or more 
    applications using the same ASIO device at the same time. In other words, you'll need Steinberg's or Vidance's ASIO multi-client driver to route more than one program to the same audio interface. Another alternative is to use JACK I found some people were using JACK to solve this issue. It's an internal routing system for audio and MIDI. If it's anything like Soundflower, I believe they might be routing everything to JACK, and then routing JACK to the audio interface, using JACK like a mixer. Edit: I've recently tried to use the Steinberg ASIO multi-client in Windows 10, and couldn't get it to work. The driver is really old and not officially supported, so it might be obsolete now (it probably works in other versions of Windows, but I can't test that atm). What I found is that many audio interface manufacturers have a multi client built in in their ASIO drivers, so look for those specific interfaces if you want an easy solution. Still no idea on how to solve this for ASIO4ALL though, other than the multi clients mentioned that might or might not work in different versions of Windows."
Having trouble memorizing intervals in ear training,"There aren't any special intervals you should focus on. All of them are equally important. What you can do is to find songs you know, with melodies you can sing, and see what kind of intervals they use.  This way you'll remember what the intervals sound like. Now, no one can really suggest these kind of songs to you. They have to be songs you know and remember the melody, otherwise they won't help you.  So, find a dozen songs you like and see the music sheet. Mark down the intervals and then listen to them again, more carefully.  This has helped me a lot in my ear training. see if you can find some kids' songs, like happy birthday, that everyone knows, have simple intervals and are easy for ear training  Here is a good video example I found online, where the singer says what interval he sings:

How to handle a newly purchased score book that won't stay opened?,"You can try to soften the spine by opening it in various locations and flexing the book gently. (Here's a nice version of the procedure, with diagrams, even; and here's another, similar graphic, this one from a bookbinder.) If that doesn't work, you can get a piece of clear plastic and leave it over the pages; not an ideal solution, but it will let you use the book.  In the end, don't be too concerned with keeping the book in mint condition, unless this is a valuable or rare volume. Break the spine if need be; you can always repair the book later, or hold it together with a rubber band. A book of scores is of no use if you can't use it.  "
What are the advantages of learning to play on your own versus learning from a teacher?,"It depends on the route you want to go. Some people say a guitar teacher is necessary... I would say not. Plenty of the most well known guitar players in the world on not trained by a teacher. Think about the music you want to play.  Almost anything in the blues/rock world can be self-taught. There is not a right way to play the blues, no matter what the elitists tell you. And rock (sometimes) is a natural extension of blues. Now if you want to break into classical or metal, you will need to learn some classical techniques. Know your scales, chords, and how to improvise in a technical setting. There are, however, parts of the metal world where unconventional playing is welcome, and even encouraged. Such as funk metal. My advice is this: If you plan to go into a technical music genre, get yourself a teacher and learn to do things the ""right"" way, so that you can play with others freely when you get good enough. If you want to play by yourself, or are going to stick to less classically influenced music types, just head over to youtube! I learned guitar for about 3 years on nothing but youtube videos and a chord book. There was a particular guitar player that I admired at the time and I just watched live videos of him and imitated what I saw. Overtime, I became proficient with the guitar and started writing my own songs. I believe this is a very creative and enjoyable route if you're willing to not be taken seriously by more technical bands and guitarists. Regardless of what you choose. Make sure you spend time learning the songs you love as early as possible. Nothing kills the learning motivation like playing stuff that does not interest you."
Why do standard modern pianos have 88 keys?,"Well, the piano started out with only about 60 keys, same as the harpsichord – in fact it WAS a harpsichord, except that the harpsichord maker Bartolomeo Cristofori (try saying that 10 times fast!) got the bright idea of putting hammers on one (to HIT the strings) instead of plectra (to PLUCK the strings). So the piano was invented – this was around 1700, or maybe a little before that. Anyway, as composers began to use the new instrument they started writing more and more complicated and brilliant music for it. Pretty soon, the keyboard had to expand in both directions.  By the middle of the 19th century, it had 85 notes – up to A – then finally they added the last three at the top. There's even a piano made today – the Bösendorfer Imperial Concert Grand – which has 97 keys; the bass notes go all the way down to C.  It's nine-and-a-half feet long and weighs almost a ton. — Piano Education - FAQ"
How does string gauge affect a guitar's sound and playability?,"The thicker the string, the more tension it needs, to produce the same note. Sound Thicker, tighter strings, have a more ""focussed"" sound. They reach their resonant frequency more quickly, because the extra tension leaves them less scope to flap around. Thicker, tighter strings, plucked the same distance, are louder, because they contain more energy. There is more metal being waved back and forth in front of the pickup. There is more kinetic energy to be transmitted to the sounding board. Looking at this in the opposite direction, heavier strings need to vibrate less in order to produce the same volume as a narrower string. So you are less likely to experience fret buzz at the same loudness. Thicker, tighter strings, plucked the same distance, have more sustain, because they contain more energy and it takes longer to disperse. Of course, that energy doesn't come from nowhere. It takes more strength to pluck a thicker string. Playability The more tense a string is, the harder it is to fret -- you have to press harder. Beginners are likely to prefer narrower gauges and looser strings, until they develop callouses on their fingers. Players wishing to play very fast solos often choose light strings, because they can make gentle, fast fretting movements. The looser a string is, the easier it is to bend. This is an advantage if you want to incorporate dramatic bends into your playing. However, with very light strings, it can be too easy to bend notes -- to the extent that a beginner can have trouble playing a chord in tune, accidentally bending one string or another. Typical gauges Strings are sold individually, but most people buy sets. Buying a set gives you the confidence that the gauges work well together. As shorthand, the gauge of the top E string is used to describe the set. For example ""a set of 10s"" would refer to a set in which the top E string is 0.010 inches. On both electric and acoustic metal-strung guitars: Correspondingly, the bottom E strings tend to range from 0.047 to 0.059. The choice of which gauge to use is a personal one, based on your playing style and the tone you are trying to achieve."
"Why does a piano have only one or two strings per note in the bass register, but three for other registers?","The fatter bass strings move a lot more air when they're hit with the hammers in the piano, so they produce more volume of sound.  The short thin strings at the top do not, so having more of them compensates. Also, they sound richer when more are played. Think of an orchestra - not many double basses, but quite a few violins. With one thin string or ten, it wouldn't make any difference to their propensity to break as they would individually be under the same tension,but it could make the stress on the frame higher,causing other problems. Three appears to be the optimum number, brought about by years of practice."
Are there any great open questions in music theory/psychoacoustics?,"Dissonance is a keenly debated subject within music theory. Because of the lack of a proper definition, and due to the general subjectivity of the general understanding of the term, it's really hard to define any chord as consonant/dissonant. Dissonance has been explained many ways and as different phenomenons (e.g. the coincidence of partials), but none of these definitions explain the term thoroughly and generally. In addition to the mere definition of the term, there's also the perception of dissonance — what makes one person find the microtonal intervals pleasant, and another person find them unpleasant? This may not be what you're seeking, but since music theory doesn't operate with the same rules as mathematics (such as axioms), any term can be defined in its own right and does not need to be defined in terms of another term. Thus everything can be defined as the mere ""empirical"" perception of the phenomenon."
Why don't we measure the size of intervals starting from zero?,"I really think the answer to this question has most to do with how music is composed. Tonal composers are not really thinking at all about the math behind the intervals; they're thinking about the sounds.  Another way of looking at this is that all tonal music is scale-based, and when playing a scale from bottom to top you number the notes starting from 1. The names for intervals come right out of these scale formations. i.e. The ""first note of the scale"" and the ""fifth note of the scale"" create an interval of a ""fifth"". (And in order to figure out the quality of the interval--major or minor--you always need to construct a new scale starting on the bottom note, so the off-by-one issue doesn't really arise.) No one before the advent of computer technology would ever think of calling the first element of any ordered set of things the ""zeroth"" item. That's as far as I'm going to try to go on the ""why 1-indexing makes sense"" route, but I want to give you this additional nugget to chew on: We DO have zero-indexed intervals in modern music called 12-tone technique. Not only is this zero-indexed, but it's in base 12! (When you think about it, using zero-indexing in tonal music doesn't completely solve the problem of mathematical consistency, because you're still in base 10 and not base 7...) 12-tone technique is a MUCH more mathematical approach to composition, so it makes sense to use a number system that is more mathematically consistent (or in this case, completely consistent with 12-tone-equal-temperment). It's interesting to watch musicians without a mathematical background try to get their heads around 12-tone analysis -- thinking with zero-index is hard enough for a non-programmer, but then switch out of base 10 and give equal importance to all of the chromatic notes and all of a sudden nothing makes sense anymore. ;-)"
Why does the octave number change between B and C?,"History. For centuries people just sang, and then somebody came up with a method of writing it down. Our system comes from the Western tradition. In the medieval period, most Western song was in the minor mode. The major key hadn't come into widespread usage. So the first scale they wrote down started with the note ""A"" and spelled out the A minor scale. Then in subsequent centuries the major key became more predominant. The relative major key to A minor is C major. So over the centuries they began counting from the ""C"" note and not the ""A"" note. That is why we count from the ""C"" note today."
Is there any specific reason to why are the instruments placed as they are in an orchestra?,"This is a very interesting discussion on this subject: http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=608598 Edit: adding some of the above link content on request.  I've put the original question in italics, and some of the more interesting answers follow. I understand the benefits of placing the musicians where they are in the orchestra (eg, all the strings together, all the percussions together, etc.); having similar musicians in the same place so they can all take direction from the conductor, the aesthetics of watching all the violinists' bows moving in perfect unison, etc. What I don't get is this: strictly from the standpoint of how the music reaches the listeners' ears, does the placement of the musicians matter? If the musicians were seated at random, would a blindfolded listener in the audience be able to tell that something was amiss? I don't have a citation for this, but I believe (from my years in concert band) that the smaller instruments are in front because they don't project volume nearly as well as the big ones sitting in back. A flautist standing in front of you playing at max volume is unlikely to melt your face off (figuratively of course), but a tuba definitely could. And the percussion section would need to be together to 1) keep time effectively and 2) facilitate the way percussionists have to switch instruments so frequently. I don't know exactly how the sound waves work, but I think if you put the tubas and drums in front and the flutes in the back that you wouldn't be able to hear the flutes nearly as well. Interference maybe? Or just lack of volume projection. It does have to do with the dynamics of the instruments. Note that you have 16 first violinists, playing in unison, but only three trumpets. You have eight double basses, but only one tuba. The brass and percussion can play far louder than strings. Woodwinds are in the middle. In order to adjust the dynamics, the orchestra has more strings than anything else, and they are placed near the front. The set up of the orchestra has been developed over the centuries and is the optimal way to have the correct dynamics (not to mention that the music is composed assuming this setup).  Location of sound sources uses a mix of effects. Phase is one, simple change of relative level between the ears (i.e. like the balance control on a stereo system) is more. When you listen to a pair of speakers in a stereo system these two are what are usefully used to encode position.  If you are seated in front of an orchestra you get to use much better localsisation cues. The Head Related Transfer Function HRTF is the sum of all the effects your ears and head have on the sound heard from each direction on what you finally hear. Our brains learn to decode this to make quite good localisation of sound, beyond what you would reasonably imagine possible given the infinitude of possible solutions mathematically possible. For instance discerning the height of a source, or disambiguating front from rear.  In a good venue the reverbarent sound field accounts for about 90% of the energy you hear. Not the direct sound (i.e the sound that has reflected off at least one surface versus the sound that travelled directly to you.) However the Hass effect is also critical. (This is where the figure of 1ms comes from.) It is the first arrival of the sound that determines location. If subsequent reflections of the sound arrive they merely add to the perceived level (if they are say 5 to 20 ms late) of if they are earlier, they add a sense of space, but still don't ruin the localisation. Localisation of source in an orchestra is going to depend a great deal on where you sit, and the quality of the venue. But my experience is that once you get a reasonable way back, you lose pretty much all localisation. For reasons I con't quite explain I usually get seats either very close to the front, or the front of the first balcony. The latter position yields a well integrated spacious sound and zero localisation. Front row seats yields a ridiculous separation of sources as the orchestra subtends about 120 degrees across my view. Perfect seats, middle and about row F, yields a nice spread and good localisation, but nothing like the pinpoint imaging so beloved by HiFi freaks (who really need to get out more and listen to live music.) I need to wait for the season ticket holders who get those seats to die before I get them.  One of the critical things about localisation is the harmonics of an instrument or speaker. We have essentially zero ability to localise low frequencies - the waveleght is so long that our head makes no difference to the amplitude, and the period so long that phase differences are useless. But the harmonics of the sound are higher frequency, and due to the quite severe non-linearity of frequency response our ears have in the low frequencies, these harmonics are significant;y emphasised versus the fundamental. A subwoofer should be impossible to localise, however a low quality one isn't to hard to find, because it has quite a bit of distortion, and harmonics that creep into the range we can localise are present. Vent noise (turbulence of the air chuffing in and out of a ported enclosure is a good one.) Orchestral instruments have quite a lot of harmonic content, that is part of what gives them their character, and interestingly those instruments that boast very low frequency notes may have more output in the harmonics than in the fundamental. The extreme example are organ pipes, where the very low stops may be 10dB down in the fundamental versus the harmonics. Which is part of the reason you can enjoy organ music at all on something less than an insane HiFi system. Horns - even a Tuba, have a remarkable amount of energy in the harmonics. Its what gives a horn its sound. Bowed instruments are essentially a sawtooth wave, so even a double bass has a solid helping of harmonics. "
What is the difference between male head voice and falsetto?,"Falsetto and chest voice are different mechanisms.  Basically, falsetto stretches the vocal folds by lengthening the distance between their fixtures (the larynx mechanism is a rather complex contraption with various muscle groups changing the overall geometry).  Chest voice, however, also involves tightening the muscles at the base of the vocal folds themselves, so it changes the consistency of the folds, not ""just"" their length.  That makes it comparatively easy to achieve good closure but produces a number of harmonics.  The pure falsetto action, in contrast, leaves the muscles in the folds alone, leading to a rather pure tone (bad for distinguishing vowels, actually).  With practice, one can achieve good closure and a rich tone even with falsetto.  As this requires the ""falsetto configuration"" of the larynx to be close to complete, good closure works best in the high range.  Which means that the use of the full falsetto (rather than a more mixed head voice) works better for natural baritones or basses rather than the rare true tenor. The larger larynx and larger involved forces make it advisable not to start too early with heavy training: the cartiledge forming the respective mechanism takes decades to fully harden (ossify) after mutation."

Playing a Coltrane polychord and the limits of space,"Unless you have a seven string guitar, this chord is impossible to play on guitar if you want all chord degrees represented.  Since it is a G-minor chord over an Fm7, you can really think of the total composite chord as an Fm13, which is a pretty standard jazz chord for guitarists. . . or any jazz player for that matter. What notes you leave out in part depends on the ensemble you're playing in.  For example, if you're playing in a jazz trio with guitar, sax, and drums then you're going to need to cover at least some of the rudimentary harmony (root, third, seventh, etc) with a frugal selection of upper-tertian harmony (say, the ninth and thirteenth.)  Choosing a five-note chord in this way is good for having an active bass line, which is important if you're playing fingerstyle. If you're playing with a bassist or a pianist (or both) then usually with upper-tertian chords the guitar plays a lot of the ""active"" or ""filler"" harmonies - notably chord extensions and other active tones. On the other hand, if you want to show a clear delineation between the chords (such as Coltrane notated) then it would be wise for you to voice the Fm7 below a Gm triad.  Since you will have to obviously omit one note, the fifth of the Fm7 would be omitted since it is a four note chord and the fifth is almost always omitted first as it is the least harmonically active of the pitches. Thus, an example of an appropriate voicing would be (from lowest to highest): F, Ab, Eb, G, Bb, D That said, the lead sheet does not indicate the inversion of the chord, so feel free to experiment with shapes that give you the easiest flexibility - as long as the two chords remain separate.  As indicated in the score, one or both chords may be in inversion if necessary.  Hope that helps."
Teaching a student to match pitch,"Ear training is an unfortunate problem here in America.  For children during their earliest formative years, precedence is given to visual and tactile learning.  While this learning is undoubtedly important, too often are ears left under-developed.  If hearing were trained the same way as sight, everyone would have perfect pitch. If I were teaching this student, I would go to the most rudimentary concepts possible and begin ""calibrating"" their ears.  I agree that the problem partly stems from listening.  I believe it is also an awareness problem in addition to lack of personal aural development. I would begin by simply having her identify sounds: cars, birds, telephone, people talking, etc.  Identifying everyday sounds should be within her capabilities and should begin to boost her confidence and attitude.  Having a positive attitude is crucial to learning new information.   After identifying basic, everyday sounds, I would then work on having her differentiate between ""high"" and ""low"" sounds, starting with the piano's extreme registers.  I would do this both with chords and individual notes.  Next, I would gradually work my way inward toward middle C with the resulting goal of her identifying higher or lower minor-seconds. It would also be wise to have her demonstrate high and low sounds - not necessarily musical sounds, but so that she shows and awareness in registral difference.  Once she has shown an ability to differentiate between high and low sounds, I would then play a single pitch from the center of her vocal range and ask her to match that pitch.  If she is incorrect, I would ask her if she sang higher or lower than the pitch I played. Part of the problem here is that given your explanation, I believe that she has an underdeveloped awareness of her own phonating resonance.  To aid in this awareness, I would have her plug her ears and attempt to match pitch while humming, using an ""mmmm"" vocalization.  Doing this greatly amplifies perceived phonating resonance and should diminished awareness as a variable. Once she is able to match a given pitch, I would then work to put it in context of a two note chord, working through matching each pitch of the chord.  I would use a perfect-fifth as this two note chord because the perfect-fifth is the 3rd easiest interval to hear after a unison and octave respectively. Once she is confident in matching two-note chords, I would add the corresponding 3rd to create a major triad.  I would then play matching games asking her to sing different parts of the chord; obviously varying the chord each time. This is by no means comprehensive, and should be realistically accomplished over the course of several lessons.  If she is only meeting with you once a week, you, her, and her parents will see little improvement unless she is a very conscientious student. At the least, I hope this gets the ball rolling. Good luck, and keep us updated."

Why can't we play rap on piano?,"Rap is rhythmic speech. Speech has pitch any time there is a vowel sound or other vocal cord-produced sound happening. (F and S sounds are examples of sounds that don’t require vocal cord movement.) As rhythmic speech, rap definitely has pitch; it’s just not necessarily (or ever?) what we would call melodic, nor is it in equal temperament and organized into 12 pitches per octave. (Pianos have 12 pitches per octave, not 7.) Instruments can definitely mimic singing and speech, to varying degrees of success. Electric guitar is much more pitch-flexible than piano. Here's an example of call and response between a vocalist and a guitarist. For the most part, this is melodic and doesn't answer the question, but it's a simple introduction to how it works and it may help to see it as it gets more esoteric. Moving on, here's a band who made a hard rock backing track to the film Bambi. Listen as the electric guitarist mimics the speech of the rabbit character, Thumper. With computers, speech can be analyzed to find the constituent pitches of formants, which are the harmonic components that vowel sounds and voiced consonants (mmm, for example) have in human speech. This is how vocal correction algorithms like Auto-Tune work. Once analyzed, formants can be manipulated to become melodic, as this video of MLK's ""I Have a Dream"" speech demonstrates. This German-language video shows some MIDI data played back on an automated piano (i.e. played robotically like a Yamaha Disklavier). The MIDI pitch data was extracted from human speech in high resolution. See if you can understand what's being ""said"" without looking at the subtitles. (The piano ""speaks"" in English.) There's no reason this technique couldn't be applied to rap music, assuming you have the vocal tracks isolated. Of course, this may not be humanly possible, but it doesn't mean it isn't possible. It’s also of limited use, since duplicating pitch isn’t really important in rap. It’s about getting the syllables to fall on particular parts of the beat. Update: I found an additional video by music YouTuber Adam Neely, which, in a way, also addresses this question. He's applying the technique of mimicking speech to finding inspiration for creating jazz fusion music. The speech comes from a Simpsons episode, which he recreates on bass guitar. He also adds harmony on a synthesizer. His video includes a couple of the examples I linked above and has more besides."
Why are birds never out of key when they sing?,"Birds don't sing in a key. Keys are human cultural constructions with some basis in physics, but primarily just artful constructions of a sentient mind. In fact, when you hear a parrot or something similar attempt to mimic human song, it's not nearly as ""in key"" as even an average human singer would be. Birdsong only sounds pleasant because you've learned to associate the sound of birdsong with pleasant things. This is clearly not uncommon! But don't confuse ""pleasant-sounding"" with ""in key."" They are NOT the same. A babbling brook, I might say, is a pleasant sound--but it's not even something that can be easily defined in pitch. Now, what you may be hearing are recognizable intervals between notes being sounded by what I'd call a monophonic pitched songbird. It might be possible to interpret groups of these notes as if they were in a key, and in fact some composers are known to do this (see Olivier Messiaen). However, intervals between pairs of notes don't put birdsong into a key, since every next interval is going to imply something totally different. The intervals themselves are probably based on the harmonic series (since that's the easiest way for physics to work), which is a shared root attribute of human cultural tonality, hence why those notes can sounds like they're ""in key""."
How would you live perform a piece whose recording has a faded ending?,"I'd recommend just finding a number of fade-out songs and looking for live videos on YouTube (etc.) to see how they're handled. There are a number of ways, but here are some common ones: For what it's worth, Elton John has a ton of recorded songs that fade out. Maybe use him as a good case study to see what all he does! Edit: Since you're working with a brass band, I would say the best bet would be to create a little tag ending or transition of some kind to move between two pieces. I'd be happy to write a little transition for you if you'd like! ;-)"
Why don’t piano teachers teach the chord method of playing to young children and adults?,"Just like there's pop, rock, folk, jazz, metal, etc. guitar, there are many different disciplines of piano playing, each with a different set of required skills: I consider these as separate subjects, and in music schools there's usually a separation between at least classical and pop/rock/jazz. Additionally, you might think of playing pop/rock/jazz keyboards like synthesizers etc. as a different discipline. I quite often see people buying ""Casio"" style plastic home keyboards and expecting to play piano pieces on them, even though the keyboards don't play like actual pianos at all. In the classical tradition, pieces are written down note-for-note and reading notation is essential. In pop song accompaniment, it doesn't really matter what notes you play, as long as you support the melody and other people. People might even use ""music sheets"" with just lyrics and chord symbols on them, and no staff notation at all. Like this: Your question could be paraphrased as: ""Why don’t classical piano teachers teach the chord method of playing?"" And the answer would be: because that method is not used in classical piano practice. It is used in pop piano. If you want to learn pop piano, don't select classical piano as your subject. A part of the problem is, even today people may not be aware of the differences between the disciplines. Certainly 30-40 years ago, pop piano was not a commonly taught subject in music schools. Classical music was the norm, and the few pop/jazz schools were separate entities. From what I recall, practically all pop pianists or keyboard players were largely self-taught, when it comes to pop accompaniment. Many had studied classical piano, but the skills needed in pop music were a separate thing you had to learn somewhere else, unofficially, ""under the counter"", and in practice. Maybe there was something about pop accompaniment, but as an optional extra later on. But today, things are different - pop piano playing is better acknowledged, and the classical approach isn't assumed by default. I've been following a young relative's pop/jazz piano studies, and it's about chords all the way. The music sheets are just melody and chord symbols, and they don't care about things like scale fingerings at all. Instead, among other things, they've looked at how analog synthesizers work! Think about having arrived to your piano lesson, and the teacher says: ""On today's lesson, we'll be playing this Moog synthesizer."" Today, if you seek piano lessons, a good teacher or school should ask you, what kind of piano playing you're interested in. A teacher should explain the differences, and if needed, direct the prospective student to another teacher."
"What exactly does ""feat."" mean?","Just featuring. This is used when there is an invited artist on a track. It is not restricted to music. It was used on film and show billboards.

Why can't the piano play middle eastern music?,"A modern piano is tuned to 12-TET, 12-tone equal temperament.
12-TET is what's called a tuning system, almost all current Western music uses it.
It basically means 12 notes per octave and the notes are spread equally, it's the same distance (measured in fractions of an octave) between all of them. Persian music uses a different system. I'm no expert, but Essentials of Persian music says that there are three competing models to describe Persian music: Whether there are 24, 22, or some other number of tones per octave, it's more than the 12 on a piano, and many of the them are tuned differently. Demo of differences between quarter tones in Persian/Arabic/Turkish music. Piano can't play that. Instruments that can fall in two groups: Some have continously variable pitch (e.g. violin or trombone), while others have a standard 12-tone fingering but can pitch bend a semitone or more so it can cover all the intermediate pitches as well (e.g. saxophone, synthesizer, probably fretted guitar)."
What is the first scale one should learn on guitar,"It really depends what type of music you want to do; and how deeply you want to understand the mechanics of music itself. If you just want to get straight into jamming a tune; learn the pentatonic scale, its about the easiest scale to learn and very versatile; something like 70% of the licks in all popular since the mid 60's is pentatonic based, and even before that most blues was pentatonic based (with an added note between the third and the forth intervals) Here is Pentatonic scale in A Its a good idea to learn this up and down; learn it well slowly before you start to speed up.  A wise man once told me that if you never practice to play things slowly first you never learn how to play slowly.   Practice it in different keys; its a good idea to find backing tracks to jam over, be musical. Here is Blues scale in A (with the added note) Note the added chromatic interval this where that classic blues sound comes from; its a good idea to try sliding into this note, or bending into it rather than playing it straight all the time; be expressive with it its the blues. If you want to take this further you could bleed over into the natural minor as the mood takes you, since it differs from the pentatonic by only two notes. A Minor scale These scales are all pretty interchangeable in the key of A minor; however learning the minor scale particularly give you a whole new range of options. A minor contains all of the notes of the Key of C Major, and so is rooted in C major, starting from its 6 interval (Aeolian Mode).  This being the case, if you play A minor from its 3rd interval you are playing C Major.   Because of this you have access to all of the other modes of the C Major Scale. B Locrian - C Ionian(Major) - D Dorian - E Phrygian - F Lydian and  G Mixolydian If you start the A minor scale from each of the notes above, and carry on through an octave, you are playing the corresponding mode above.   Each of these modes sounds good at certain times (over certain chords (their own)); each mode contains 'deviant'(from the major scale) intervals, which when embellished over the right chords really bring out the sound of the mode.  So technically by 'really' leaning A minor you have learned a whole branch of music theory, actually using this stuff really opens up your playing. The stuff that I have just mentioned is the essential 'in the box' stuff.  Things can get a lot more interesting if you start swapping modes in and out of your root key, from A minor to A Dorian for instance.   A Dorian is rooted in G Major/E Minor, so you have the whole set of modes again from a different key signature, but you can remain rooted in the key of A. Im not going any further since i'm already Waaay past the scope of the answer, so in summary: Pentatonic/blues is a good first scale to learn if you just want to get playing. Then if you want to take your knowledge further, the minor scale is only two extra notes, and it gives you access to all of the above and a whole world more."
"Is F Lydian mode in the ""key"" of C Major?","No. A key* is not just a set of notes, it tells you the tonal center**  of a piece and the expected harmony and melody of the piece. If that was the case we wouldn't even distinguish between major and minor as they have the same set of notes as do all 7 modes of the diatonic scale. How you use your harmony and melody will define the key and tonal center by making one note sound like it is more at home than the others. Take this simple progression that would be more at home in F Lydian rather than C major: In general the harmony of Lydian and Major(Ionian) are pretty similar with the distinction being the augmented 4th (in this case B) which will typically come out in the melody and harmony. We start on an F chord and we end on C which takes us right back to F so we feel F as the tonal center. In analysis we would denote this as: If we truly perceived  C as the tonal center in this progression the analysis would yield: We're now looking at the progression as in ""the key of C"" and it may work in some contexts, but calling F the tonal center makes much more sense. You would want to end your progression on an F major chord. *Typically when you talk about a key you talk about tonality and typically use the terms major and minor rather than modality and refer to the modes themselves, but the idea is still there. **Even the phrase ""tonal center"" when apply to modes is a little fuzzy strange to apply to modes as the tonal refers to tonality, but for continuity I'll use tonal center to describe modes too. Here's an in depth explanation about tonal vs modal for more background about the difference."
What are overtones?,"When you pluck a guitar string, there are a variety of ways it could vibrate1:  Each vibration will produce a different pitch, because they have different frequencies. For example, the top-left corner has the lowest frequency because it has the smallest number of crests/valleys--its crests are highly infrequent. In most cases, when you play an instrument, the pitch we hear is the one with the lowest frequency. In other words, we hear the pitch produced by the top-left vibration. But when we listen a little more closely (as you've probably done), we can hear higher pitches being produced from the string at the same time. That's because the string isn't just vibrating with the lowest frequency. It is also simultaneously vibrating with some of the higher frequencies shown in the image above. Those higher frequencies are what folks often refer to as the ""harmonics."" So in essence, the ""harmonics"" are higher pitches/tones that occur when you strike a string, blow air through a wind instrument, etc. They are produced because strings, air, etc. don't vibrate in simple, singular ways. Rather, they vibrate with many different frequencies at once, producing a combination shape like this2:  While it's true that the string vibrates with all of these different frequencies at the same time, it should be noted that the harmonics occur in varying strengths/intensities. In many cases only the first few upper harmonics are audible at all, and the others simply aren't produced or are too faint to hear. To test this, go to an acoustic piano and very gently depress the C5 key. Press down so gently that it doesn't create a sound at all when the hammer strikes. While holding down the C5 key, quickly strike and release the C4 note. What you'll notice is that the C5 string continues to ring out even after the C4 string is muted. The reason this happens is: the C4 string vibrates with its fundamental frequency, but it also vibrates with its 2nd harmonic, and the 2nd harmonic is C5. So when C4 vibrates, its 2nd harmonic excites the C5 string through a phenomenon called resonance. Harmonics are important for many reasons. To name a few: they create an extra harmonious sound when certain chords are played. Piano hammers are placed in specific locations to avoid exciting dissonant harmonics. They are used by some brass instruments to reach notes that wouldn't be available without harmonics. To clarify the terminology: the lowest frequency produced on the string/in the air is called the ""first harmonic"" or the ""fundamental frequency."" That's the frequency we predominantly hear. The higher harmonics (those above the first) are the extra notes that we hear ringing faintly with higher pitches. 1:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Standing_waves_on_a_string.gif
2:http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu/projects/sonicg/terms/harmonic.html This description presents a simplified model, which is fairly accurate for most instruments. In reality, harmonics and overtones are two different things. ""Overtone"" has a broader meaning: ""any higher frequency above the fundamental which is simultaneously produced."" To qualify as a harmonic frequency, there's an extra condition: ""any higher frequency above the fundamental which is an integer multiple of the fundamental frequency."" So ""overtone"" is an umbrella term, and there are two types of overtones: (1) ""harmonic"" overtones (which are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency) and (2) overtones that aren't integer multiples of the fundamental frequency (I'll call these disharmonious overtones). Everything I've discussed above has been about harmonic overtones. This is a fine way to answer the question, I think, because in the case of most instruments, the overtones deviate only slightly from the true harmonic frequencies. So in many cases, the overtones are close enough to be considered harmonic frequencies. The higher overtone frequencies may not be exactly twice the fundamental frequency, or 3x the fundamental frequency, but they're pretty close. For some other instruments, though, the overtone frequencies will differ more dramatically from the true harmonics. For example, on timpani, the first overtone is 1.6 times the fundamental frequency. This dissonance is usually small, though, and many instruments are designed to minimize it."
Collective word for sharps and flats in the key signature,"An accidental is not the note as you describe it. That word does refer to the sign itself, not the note. The question remains whether it is correct to use it in the context of a key signature as well. Personally, I don't have any problem with the phrase ""accidentals in the key signature,"" but would typically just say ""sharps or flats,"" since you're never going to see double sharps or double flats in a key signature, at least not in traditional music, and naturals will only be used as a courtesy or to ""reset"" to C major. Did you research if the German, Dutch, or Russian sources have a different word for ""accidental""?"
Is redundancy used when live recording important performances?,"So, I work in live production, specifically in audio. With very, very few exceptions the mics themselves and the mic cables have no immediate redundancy other than someone being ready to deal with a problem should one occur (though if a lead vocalist is using a wireless mic, there may be a wired mic tucked away someplace on stage the talent can get to quickly if such an arrangement is practical.) The reality is that the mics aren't terribly prone to failure while in use (except in musical theatre, but that's a different lecture). Cables? Most of them, once plugged in and laid out aren't being touched or moved; they're also not likely to fail. There are exceptions of course, but most of those scenarios have been replaced with wireless anyway. For all sorts of reasons, anything critical on wireless will typically have some form of redundancy available. In the pure analog days, all the mic inputs went to analog transformer isolated splits. One and only one console would provide phantom power for those mics and DI boxes (which convert the signal from instruments like electric guitars to a level and type useful for mixing consoles) that require an external power supply; typically this would be the monitor console. The remaining splits (however many required - would go to FOH audio (the PA), broadcast, multitrack recording etc...) so that each would get its own clean perfect copy of all signals that they could manipulate, process, and mix as required. So, at that point, a failure of something with the PA for example would leave the broadcast or recording unaffected. Now, in terms of multitrack recording, there will often be yet another split and multiple recorders, DAW or other multitrack recording devices. Things are only sometimes different today. Most shows/concerts (though not all) use digital consoles. Virtually all these consoles are designed with the idea that your inputs go to one set of analog to digital converters and the signal then gets split and distributed to the various systems digitally. This does happen sometimes, but at this point, I'm still seeing analog splits and the various systems using their own converters after the analog splits. This choice gets made for a variety of reasons including, but not exclusively, to maintain an increased level of redundancy (other reasons include negating the need for the various audio engineers to agree and decide which engineer gets control over the analog gain applied to each signal prior to the A/D converters and what that gain should be set to.) We tend to be a prickly, opinionated lot and wars have been started over less. It's kind of a miracle you got us all to agree to the mic selection. So basically so long as the producers/promoters will pay for it, we incorporate as much redundancy as is technically practical and financially feasible in any place that is particularly prone to failure. Many top end consoles for example have two mix engines (the computer part of a digital console); if one fails, you can switch over near seamlessly to the other from the control surface (which at this point is pretty much a glorified USB keyboard and less likely to experience a failure than the mix engine)."
Why do drummers put (duct) tape on their drums?,"It reduces volume, but usually the desired effect is to remove excessive ringing. If you listen to the snare on the St. Anger record by Metallica, you'll hear the type of sounds some drummers want to mitigate with the use of tape or other dampers. This technique can be used on toms too. There it's usually not the high pitched ring of the snare, but lower frequencies that cause problems. There are damper rings and special gel manufactured for this purpose too."
How does a piano go out of tune?,"There are several reasons.  When new strings are put into a piano, they slowly ""stretch"" or relax and go flat.  In a day it will be out of tune.  You have to tune it 2 or 3 times the first month.  After a few months the strings will have settled in and will stay in tune better. If the pinblock is very old, the pins can slip, making the notes go flat. The total tension of the strings is 20 to 30 tons.  That is, the pinblock is pulled toward the bridge with 20 to 30 tons of force.  That is enough force to distort the frame a little.  So when several notes go flat, reducing the tension, the frame goes back into shape, stretching the other strings and making them go sharp! You asked what it sounds like when the strings of a unison start to go out of tune.  if two vibrate at 440 Hz and one at 439 Hz, the two pitches will interfere with each other and you will hear a wavering ""beat"" at one cycle per second.  If the third is at 438 Hz, you'll hear two beats per second.  It gives a feeling of motion to the sound.  This effect can be done deliberately in electronic organs and synthesizers and is called ""chorus"".  It's like the difference between one singer singing alone and several singing in unison. Pipe organs have a stop named ""Voix Celeste"" or ""Unda Maris"" which consists of two pipes for each note, tuned slightly apart so that they beat at about 3 to 5 beats per second.  It's a heavenly effect, or at least whoever named it ""Voix Celeste"" thought so. A ""Honky Tonk"" effect is when the strings of a piano are badly out of tune, making it sound like the piano player in the saloon in an old Western movie.  Some electronic pianos have a ""Honky Tonk"" patch imitating this. Cold weather makes pianos go sharp, and hot weather makes them go flat.  But cold weather makes pipe organs go flat, and hot weather makes them go sharp, and that is why a church piano and pipe organ are rarely in tune with each other."
Why is B♯ higher than C♭ in 31-ET?,"This question seems to arise from a “linear” mental model of notes. C♭ C C♯ D♭ D D♯ E♭ E E♯ F♭ F F♯ G♭ G G♯ A♭ A A♯ B♭ B B♯ C♭ C C♯ Like a piano keyboard, but somehow with 31 notes per octave instead of 12.  (Building or playing such an instrument is left as an exercise for the reader.) But instead, look at the notes in Circle of Fifths order. F♭ C♭ G♭ D♭ A♭ E♭ B♭ F  C  G  D  A  E  B  F♯ C♯ G♯ D♯ A♯ E♯ B♯ It may be helpful to rearrange alternating notes in this series into two staggered rows, like this: This produces an isomorphic note layout (specifically, two rows of Wicki-Hayden), in which: Note that, if you pick a single frequency ratio (call it x) for the P5, then you get the P4 (2/x, the octave inversion of P5, taking as axiomatic that an octave is a double of frequency) and M2 (x2/2) for free, and from any base pitch (e.g., A4 = 440 Hz), you can calculate the fundamental frequency of any note.  If a reasonable choice is made for x, this gives you a syntonic temperament. (Relaxing the requirement that P5 be a consistent pitch ratio allows other tunings, such as 5-limit just intonation, in which M2 intervals are either 9/8 or 10/9 ratios, so that M3 can be a “nice” 5/4, at the expense of making P5 sometimes be 40/27 instead of 3/2.  But this over-complicates my analysis here, so ask another question if you wish to discuss the idea further.) Specifically, the bounds on x are: Some possible choices for x are: In 31-ET, an octave is divided logarithmically into 31 equal units, and a P5 interval is taken to be 18 of these units.  Starting from an arbitrary “origin” note C, and doing all arithmetic modulo 31, the circle of fifths can be labelled as: Or, sorting by the modulo-31 pitch class: So yes, B♯ is higher than C♭, just like E♯ is higher than F♭.  What's important is the consistency of intervals.  A perfect fifth is always 18 units, and thus: Swapping around B♯/C♭ or E♯/F♭ would break this consistency.  And by having ♯ or ♭ always be 2 units, you can similarly construct double sharps/flats of 4 units, or half-sharps/flats of 1 unit, thus filling in the rest of the chart with note names. In fact, 31-ET is far from the only system that has B♯ higher than C♭.  If the note C is assigned a frequency of 1, then B♯ = x12 / 27 and C♭ = 24 / x7, and a bit of algebra reveals that the situation occurs when x > 211/19 ≈ 1.49375896165.  The threshold is 19-ET, which makes B♯ is the same as C♭."
Identifying the interval from A♭ to D♯,"You're correct; it should be called a fourth! But since ""augmented fourth"" won't be big enough for this, we kind of had to make up a term, and the world of music theory collectively decided upon calling this interval a doubly augmented fourth. This just means that it's one half step larger than an augmented fourth. (As such, the augmented fourth is not really the ""biggest"" fourth possible.) The same is true for diminished intervals; a half step smaller than a diminished sixth will be a doubly diminished sixth. Any interval can overlap with (or, in more academic terms, ""be enharmonic to"") another interval. A perfect fifth could, in theory, be enharmonic to a triply augmented third—not that you'll encounter those very often!"
What's the short and accented note at the very end of a song called?,"In musical theater this is often called a ""button"" (particularly if it's a low note)."
"As a composer, should I be composing music for an instrument I don't play?","As a composer, you mostly end up writing for instruments that you yourself don't play.  Apart from Hindemith, it is fairly impossible to maintain a high level of proficiency on every instrument - there just isn't that much time and it is not feasible. However, that does not excuse having a working knowledge of the instrument.  Though it might seem silly to you, learning the rudiments of each instrument is hugely beneficial to aiding your writing.  By physically working with each instrument, you gain insight into things that it does / doesn't do well, sounds it makes / doesn't make, and considerations specific to performers (such as allowing enough time for mute changes or picking up mallets.) Even if you just squawk your way through Book 1 of each instrument, you will thank yourself many times over for your personal investment.  I speak from personal experience.  It was easy for me since all of the instrumental pedagogy courses were built into my degree, so by the nature of what I did I ended up learning how to play all of the instruments on a rudimentary level.  This knowledge has greatly informed my writing - not only writing idiomatically but also with phrasing, texture, and orchestration as well. It is perfectly acceptable to write music for an instrument that you don't know how to play - all that matters is that you know how to write intelligently for the instrument, how the instrument behaves, and how to make it sound good.  It is instantly apparent when a composer does not know how to write for a given instrument, and all that does is make the composer look very novice - since they in fact are. It is not enough to understand how an instrument functions soloistically or within an orchestra - it is also paramount to understand how that instrument functions in chamber settings, in choral settings, and with different families of instruments.  I would write for two clarinets very differently than I would write for clarinet and trombone duet. As a composer, you have nothing to lose by learning how to play an instrument - if for no other reason than doing so will help make you an informed composer and therefore make your music better.  Wouldn't you want to write better music? That said, I realize that it is not always feasible to do so (though it is quite affordable to rent an instrument for a month or two with a method book.) But in addition to learning what you can, I would highly suggest studying texts on orchestration.  Walter Piston, Alfred Blatter, and Samuel Adler have all put out excellent texts on the subject.  In addition, I would also highly, highly recommend that you talk to people who play the instruments for which you're writing.  They've already put in all of the time learning the instrument and can offer invaluable insight.  You can have them play through sketches and determine what works / what doesn't work.  In addition, it serves as a great resource for networking, which is crucial for getting things performed. For composers, getting things performed is the bottom line. Hope that helps."
"When practicing a new piece, how do you prevent repetition from dulling the punch?","Summarized nutshell answer: multiple short sessions of practice will be more productive than one long one. I’m no authority on it, but I understand there are different kinds of learning. Extended repetition might be good for muscle memory. Playing chord changes or scales over and over (perfectly) until they are instinctual. But when it comes to learning new concepts, extended repetition can be counterproductive. We are better served by multiple short learning sessions, than by one long session. In my own playing I have found this to also be true when recording tracks. Most of the time, after three takes it is best for me to take a break than to continue trying to improve what I’ve already done. Even on the rare occasion of a live performance, I hesitate to practice a set on the same day, as it can make the eventual performance feel stale to me. So practicing a song 2-3 times a day, maybe three times per a 15-minute session,  would probably be more productive for you than running through the song a dozen or so times in one sitting. Even 3-4 times through the song once a day is likely more productive. The brain needs down time to organize what it’s been processing. A lot of that happens when we are sleeping or when we are performing mindless tasks like driving or folding laundry (or meditating like suggested above.) Also I agree with the idea above of recording yourself. Not only can it be satisfying to hear yourself improve, providing you with a little of that “punch,” but you’ll hear what you’re playing better than while you’re playing it, and your brain will better process what can be done to improve without your busy hands/mouth/feet getting in the way. The next time you play the song your brain will remember what it heard, as well as what it may have better wanted to hear, and you’ll be able to apply those ideas to improve your playing."
How to select a key-signature for a song,"As I'm sure you're aware, you can transpose any tune to whatever key you like. One reason to choose a certain key, is simply that it sounds good.  It might be that you feel that notes of a certain pitch inherently sound pleasant on your chosen instrument. I happen to like the tone of my guitar with a capo on the 7th fret, for example. Or it might be that due to tempered tuning, the intervals work better for you (the difference between a C and a G is only approximately the difference between a D and an A). Most people can't consciously detect those differences, but there may be subconscious effects. Another reason is ease of playing. You've asked why composers don't use ""easier"" keys. Bear in mind that what's easy on one instrument isn't so easy on another. Beginner guitarists don't like C major because they have to play a barre F chord.  Beginner pianists love C major because it's all on the white keys. More experienced pianists don't find black keys to be a problem, but they like certain keys because of the way the keys fall under their fingers (often keys with lots of black keys). When composing for an orchestra or a band, you have to keep in mind preferred keys on all kinds of instruments -- violins, woodwind, harp, etc. For songs, there's also vocal range to be considered. This is probably the main reason folk/pop/rock songs get transposed. Finally there's the feel brought about by the mechanics of playing the piece in a given key on a given instrument. To go from an F to a G on a recorder, you have to lift three fingers. To go from a G to an A, you only lift one finger. You can imagine how the latter would sound cleaner -- and the effect may be more dramatic on other instruments."
Why are grand pianos usually black?,"Not particularly true! I've just sold a grand in mahogany. However, one of my theories could cover grands as well as guitars. I feel that if a solid guitar is made from a good looking, well grained piece(s) of wood, it's best just to lacquer it, so the good looks come through. If it's not that good - use a solid colour on it, and nobody will know! Grand pianos, especially concert grands, use large areas of wood - the top particularly, and to match several pieces of wood is not easy. It can be done, but at a cost. So, put a solid colour on. Why black? It fits with most things, as does the other less common colour - white. "
Why does Bach sometimes end with flat 7ths?,"Well spotted! This is very common. Bach often uses a brief modulation to the subdominant key near the end of his fugues, preludes and inventions (presumably other pieces, too). Sometimes this is so brief, that we feel like we are just travelling through this key, without really modulating to it. Sometimes this is over a final tonic pedal, which is really “bringing the harmony home”, although not in your examples.  The reason he does this, is related to how much of Western common practice music is harmonically structured. Although we may modulate to a wide range of related keys, by far the most commonly used structural modulations are basically an arch: Tonic -> Dominant -> Tonic (again). If we imagine this as a “swing” one place to the sharp side around the circle of fifths and then back again, the move to the subdominant helps to “balance” this, by swinging “a bit too far” to the flat side, as we return to the tonic, with the final settling on the tonic feeling even more like a resolution as a result. Another way to think about the same structural harmonic movement, is considering the brightness of related keys. As we move to sharper keys around the circle of fifths they sound comparatively brighter; as we move to flatter keys they sounds comparatively darker. [Thanks to Tim for commenting on this, hence the edit for clarity...] We start at the tonic, our home key, move to a brighter key, the dominant, and then back to our home key. To emphasise this movement back from a brighter key to our home key, we go ""a bit darker"" than our home key before finally settling there. We could come up with numerous analogies for this kind of movement: tuning a sharp guitar string down below the note we want, before coming back up to pitch; taking a clipping recorded volume down below the volume we want before gradually raising it to the optimum position etc."
Two voices for a solo singer written in a sheet music,"The notes with stems up are for singing in Italian, while the notes with the stems down are for singing in German. Thus, in the first picture of the original posting, in Italian it would be  ... while in German you should sing  In the second picture of the original posting, the Italian lyrics have only one syllable (“voi”) while the German lyrics have two syllables (“sel - ber”). The notes are doubled with the slur upwards, suggesting that the slur is meant for the Italian lyrics only."
"How to hide a flat pick in the right hand when switching to finger picking, Warren Haynes style","I know that Brian Setzer of the Stray Cats does this a lot too. He explains his approach ina video here; he forfeits the index finger, and uses it to hold the pick, curling it against his palm:   He then uses his thumb and remaining fingers for fingerstyle. The article says: You may find it feels awkward playing fingerstlye without your first finger, but it shouldn't take much practice before this feel completely natural. If you really can't get used to it, then try tucking the pick under whichever finger you find easiest. I can also recommend this DVD, where you can see him do it in some detail. "
What is it about this note that subverts my expectations?,"It subverts your expectations because, up until this point, that pitch hasn't been played. Your ears, attuned to Western tonality, assumed a minor key, and this particular pitch is not a part of that minor key.  The main riff is in E minor and uses the pitches G E A F♯ G. (The last pitch is harmonized with B in the second iteration of that riff.) But the next pitch is A♯, the tritone of the key. This a dissonance with the E that plays as a pedal throughout, and it's also a dissonance with the overall key, because there is no A♯ in E minor. One way we can conceptualize this is with the Implication-Realization Model. In short, there was an implication (sorry) of E minor; at the moment when the A♯ appears, the realization was not what you expected, which caused your response."
What do the terms E2 A2 D3 G3 B3 E4 actually mean?,"The letters (E,A,D etc) refer to the note. The standard tuning for the guitar is E,A,D,G,B,E (Last E is two octaves higher than the lowest one). Now, the numbers after each letter refer to the specific octave (Scientific pitch notation) of the note. As you know, there is more than one note named E. How to tell which one is which? With numbers! The number indicates the note's octave. Here you can see the different C's:  So, E2 (lowest of your guitar) would be a third above C2 in the image above. A2 would a sixth above the C2 etc. Generally, if you simply say you tune your guitar to E,A,D,G,B,E (without the numbers), it's the same thing. People with still understand you. But if you want to tell someone the exact octave of a note, you can use the aforementioned numbers. So, being thorough, the exact standard tuning of the guitar is the one you mentioned, which is: E2 A2 D3 G3 B3 E4. Αs it has been mentioned in the comments, the guitar music is written one octave above than it's played. So, you wouldn't see guitar music in the bass clef."
The difference between self-taught and professional pianists,"They say amateurs practice until they make no mistakes, while professionals practice until they're not able to make any mistakes... Mistakes include not only wrong notes but incorrect timing, dynamics, and whatever. This might be the cause for the first two characteristics you describe: they both play well but the professional is completely in control whereas the amateur must rely more on luck. I think most questions in your last big paragraph are more or less irrelevant or at least secondary, but some I can address: Now to what I think is the most important part. You say you find your own recordings unsatisfying. Good! Identify the unsatisfying parts and now you know where you have to focus your practicing. If you can figure out exactly why it sounds unsatisfying, that's great (and something a teacher should be able to do). But more importantly, try to imagine how a satisfying version would sound (a teacher should be able to demonstrate this), and then practice to get there. If you haven't followed any masterclasses (either live or YouTube or elsewhere), try it. They can give you a better idea of what I'm trying to say here. So the important thing is to a) know what you want it to sound like and b) hear what you actually sound like and c) practice with the intent to get b) closer to a). My guess is that one big difference between amateur and professional practicing is exactly with intention; a pro is always practicing to solve a particular problem while amateurs are just ""trying to get better"". Also it seems that many amateurs practice just to get the notes right, but that's really just one part of it. It is just as important to practice until you can always make that fermata sound natural and that accent be just right."
What does it mean when one flat in the key signature is in parenthesis?,"A little-known fact is that the historical basis of minor tonality is the Dorian mode.  Consequently, much 18th-century tonal music is written in a key signature that seems to lack one flat sign.  This is especially common for chorales, since the tunes are frequently from the 16th or even 15th century, when they were unambiguously Dorian. The parentheses here indicate that the editor has changed the key signature to align with modern expectations.  Many editions make such changes without informing the reader. In minor keys, of course, the sixth scale degree is occasionally raised, which gives rise to the ascending melodic minor scale.  In minor keys notated with a Dorian key signature, the sixth scale degree is instead frequently lowered by a half step.  In fact, this tendency goes back to the dawn of staff notation.  Many medieval melodies in Dorian mode feature B-flat very prominently."
Improving fretting hand strength,"Try stretching your hands every day and do some hand exercises that increase the muscle elasticity and control. It's important that you stretch any muscles before use or they will fatigue faster.  Muscle strength is not just a function of your hands though. It is a whole body experience. If your in poor shape it's very difficult to strength just one part of your body.  Also, without proper warm up you can actually create muscle fiber that is counterproductive to endurance(There are basically two types of muscles one for endurance and one for strength... But by proper training and/or genetics you can create a hybrid). In any case position is important from a physics perspective. This is why in classical music they drill in the proper position because it affords the best leverage(for your average person). I would bet that if you spend 10-15m stretching before and faster a serious practice regime you will make drastic improvements within a month. Make sure your muscles are warm before you start though. You can do this by using warm water or doing some other pre-exercise warmups(fast scales, licks, etc... usually this is slower than using warm water but helps with increasing joint mobility). There are also hand strengthen devices that do work but are probably just a waste of time unless you can use them when you can't practice on guitar. Also make sure your action is not too high or it will be difficult to barre for anyone."
Why are double staff pieces of music not properly aligned for Middle C?,"Relative to the Grand Staff, it's important to think of ""Middle C"" as a concept more than a literal visual expression. Here's why: Let's say you have a ""grand"" staff using 11 lines (5 for each staff + center for C):  At first glance,  you might think, ""that's not so bad"". However, once you add music, especially complicated music, this type of notation can be quite unwieldy. So it's split into what we commonly see as the Grand Staff, which, as others have mentioned, usually relegates a hand to each staff. So, we've solved a visual problem by separating the staves with some space. But now we have another problem: what if we want to know how loud / soft to play the music? Well, putting the dynamics on the outside of the Grand Staff is visually distracting and cumbersome:
  It is more difficult for the musician to read the music and the dynamics this way. However, keeping dynamics and other indications between staves – for the most part – can help reduce visual clutter and lead to better reading / performance. So, let's go back to the question:  **Why isn't more printed work done where the two clefs work together and actually have middle C, well, in the middle? ** In order for the staves to be exactly aligned, you'll need to sacrifice other important visual, performative, and logistical elements in the music. Using ledger lines helps us cope with this off-set. For publishers, composers, and performers, the staff spacing relative to middle C just isn't that important."
How to record a piano with high quality?,"This is a really broad question, so I'll touch on all the parts only briefly. The assumptions I'm making are: The minimum components you need to do this well are: What do they do? A room with great acoustics is, to some extent, subjective. The room needs to be large enough to allow the piano to ""breathe"". Room height is as important as the other two dimensions. If you have walls or other flat surfaces too close to the piano, sound will reflect too much and smear the recording. They'll also help to build up low frequency resonances, which you won't want on your recording. The room should be reasonably sound proofed so things like trains, birds, garbage trucks, neighborhood children, etc. aren't recorded along with your piano. (Your eyes and ears can focus; microphones, like cameras, get everything.) You'll want good sound diffusion, which is caused by having objects with lots of irregular surfaces. Some sound absorption (the foam wedges or pyramids) to tame higher frequency reflections is usually a good thing, but some natural reverberation is desirable. (Bathroom reverb is way too much; walk-in closet reverb is way too little.) An audio interface will provide the audio inputs, preamps, and phantom power you need to connect your microphones to your computer and get them working. It will also provide audio outputs so you can connect your monitoring equipment. It also handles the analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion that you will need. The DAW (digital audio workstation) is a multitrack recorder + mixer in software form. (There is a lot more to it than that. All kinds of editing features, special effects, sequencing, etc. are included in a DAW.) There are many DAWs out there. Some are free. Some are expensive. All will be capable of producing a high-quality piano recording. The monitoring equipment you'll need includes high-quality studio headphones and, ideally, a set of studio monitors. Essentially, those are loudspeakers which have a flat response. (The ""flat response"" bit is important because most speakers and stereo systems color the audio on purpose to make it ""sound good"" to its intended market. You don't want that because you want to hear what's really there. The same thing applies to headphones. You don't want the most fashionable ones, you want the good ones.) Most studio monitors are active nowadays, which means you won't need a separate amplifier. Active monitors and headphones plug directly into your audio interface. You'll need to experiment with microphone placement to get a good sound and a good stereo image. There are whole books written about that, but you might try to start by putting the microphones in an X-Y pattern above the strings. If you have a third mic, you might want it in the room or under the piano. I've seen both done. Here is a good article about it. Note that you probably won't get a great sound your first time trying. People who do this for a living have years of experience and training on you. If you're expecting a world-class recording coming from anything but a grand piano recorded in a spacious studio with good diffusion, you're likely going to be disappointed. A better use of your money (especially if this is a one-off thing) might be: renting time in a recording studio where they already have the
equipment and expertise to make a great recording making a MIDI recording on a high-quality MIDI controller or a
digital piano and sending the MIDI to a studio like this,
this, or this, where they'll use a Yamaha Disklavier to render
your performance on a acoustic piano and send you the recording. If, on the other hand, you're talking about recording a digital piano or a software piano or a sampled/modeled piano patch from a workstation, synthesizer, stage piano, or whatever, you'll do just fine with the budget you have, and you won't need microphones."
What are good resources for learning music theory?,"Check out Dave Weiners Youtube channel he covers all the modes there and a whole lot more, the Mixolydian lesson is particularly good as he applies it to multiple styles and explains why it works. Dave Weiner Youtube channel This guy tours with Vai and still finds time to make these lessons, awesome."
F# major vs Gb major?,"Of the 12 major keys, F♯/G♭ is the only one that can be reasonably notated in two ways (for example, C♭ and C♯ are far more awkward than B and D♭). Both F♯ and G♭ are in common use, but G♭ is rather more common. Why? If the music sticks to the diatonic major scale (as this piece largely does), then both keys are equally complicated, but major-key music often introduces secondary dominants such as V/ii and V/vi (seen in mm. 10 and 16 of this piece respectively) that are written with naturals in G♭ but would require double sharps in F♯. It is slightly more unusual to see the brief modal mixture that shows up in the score as double flats. So the key choice is a toss-up, and Dvorak chose the slightly more familiar G♭. As for the resultant mismatch with the middle section, pianists are used to seeing enharmonic key changes when moving to the parallel minor (e.g. the D♭ maj-C♯ min shift in Chopin's 3rd Scherzo, Fantaisie-Impromptu and the ""Raindrop"" Prelude)."
Where to rest your thumb when playing bass: Pickup vs. Strings vs. Thumbrests,"Aside from playing guitar, I've also played bass in several contexts from funk, soul, fusion, rock, and metal and also teach bass, so I'd like to humbly offer my opinion. There is no ""right"" technique. Although resting on the pickup is popular, there are also plenty of exceptions. If you check out bass legends like Gary Willis and Stanley Clarke, you'll notice they have remarkably different ways of resting their thumb. Also depending on the bassline, bassists might use multiple strategies, often shifting back and forth from the pickup and to the strings in the course of one song. Further, some bassists ""float"" - they don't rest their thumb on anything at all! Right hand technique is often a hot topic of debate, but these are all different schools of thought with the same goal: Achieving the most efficient right hand technique with minimum tension, and trying to overcome the difficulty of crossing strings while reducing unwanted noise. As long as you and your teacher are working on that, it's ""valid"".  If you've only been playing for two months, I say follow your teacher's advice and spend most of your time on the pickup for now. The point is to stick with one method for the meantime, and use that to learn the fundamentals of music and rhythm. As your experience on the instrument advances, you'll be able to make better judgements on how to adjust your technique to suit you best."
Mental approach to improvisation,"If you have to think about what you're going to play, then you've already missed the moment in the tune to play it. Thinking and playing need to happen simultaneously, they need to be the same thing. I may think about a solo in some larger sense, like where I want to go through a chord progression or how my melody interplays with a vocal line, but I don't tend to give it too much thought on a measure by measure or note by note basis. That's kind of hard to get to though, and I've been improvising for 18 years now.  So what do I teach my students? Although, like everything else on this site, that first one is the real killer. You have to practice. A lot. All the time. "
Can absolute pitch be learned or acquired by anyone?,"I achieved a degree of absolute pitch (AP) as an adult, but of course this was not done in a controlled manner, so the scientific reliability of my case is implicitly questionable. Anyway, here's what happened: As a student who specialized in music in high school, and then pursued a Bachelor of Music degree in college, my path follows a pretty standard one in terms of trained classical musicians (who are not identified as ""prodigies"" VERY early in life). Being around people who did posses AP meant that I was able to self-define as not possessing it, since I was incapable of doing the same kinds of mental-aural recall and identification that they were. My general ""aural skills"" were still very good, as any of my teachers will tell you; my aural skills professor asked me ""Do you have perfect pitch?"" in one of the first few weeks of class. It is common for a well-trained sense of relative pitch (RP) to be mistaken for AP when you meet a younger student whose skills seem to be beyond the level of RP training he/she is expected to have undergone. At high levels of musical training and skill, a musician that possesses AP is not capable of much more than a similarly-skillful musician that only possesses RP. Music theory is based almost entirely upon RP phenomena, so all musicians must learn it. Anyway, about 1-2 years into my undergraduate degree, I started getting really interested in aural skills in general as well as the AP phenomenon, and started doing some hardcore middle-of-the-night ""internet research"" on the topic. There appeared to be some anecdotal evidence that AP could be learned, but at the same time most of the ""training methods"" being advertised looked like snake oil salesmen. In the end, it turned out that there was a significant mental block I had to overcome simply to the fact that B and C (or any other two notes) sound different to one another. After that, there's a lot of almost meditative work to do to listen for those differences, while connecting back to repertoire that you know and can accurately recall; and finally comes the unending process of designing and studying aural skills exercises that specifically target your learning needs with increasing difficulty. That's the basic 3-step process in my experience. Right now, my AP skill is at the point where I can produce or recognize any given pitch out of context with a very high degree of accuracy, but with non-instantaneous response times. When I am incorrect, I'm never off by more than a semitone. In these ways, I draw a lot of parallels between training AP and training RP -- in the sense that a student makes the same kinds of mistakes at lower levels of facility. Metaphorically speaking, it's as if the aural definition I can perceive of pitch is very sharp for some notes and sometimes blurry for others, but given enough time I can ""figure it out"" in my head for any note. Timbral differences throw in another variable that doesn't apply as much to RP training, at least for me. I have found all of this to improve with continued study. For these reasons, I feel that ""perfect pitch"" (PP) is a useful term to use as distinct from AP--though colloquially they are seen as synonyms, I like to use AP as we do in this post, but use PP to refer to the ""hyper-skillful"" sense of AP that we see in people who picked it up intuitively at a very young age (honed by copious amounts of formal musical training). In conclusion, I believe that the similarities I have experienced between AP and RP in my own musical (self-)education indicate that it is possible for anyone to achieve AP or even PP through training. There is of course an understanding that people are predisposed to musical skill based on their exposure to music during their upbringing, but this impacts RP awareness and training just the same as it does AP--and no one has ever said, ""Oh, you'll never be able to play like Coltrane no matter how hard you work at it, because you're not genetically predisposed."" There appear to be some societal preconceived notions that you can achieve any level of skill through dedicated training and hard work, but for some reason PP is an exception that ""you must be born with"". I see no reason for this to be anything but that; a preconceived notion. This is the closest one I can find to it at the moment, but I am aware of a study that shows that people without musical training, when singing their favorite pop songs a cappella, more often than not, are able to do so in the correct key. This indicates that most people have some intuitive pitch memory even if they don't realize it, which is one of the primary building blocks of AP training. I haven't been engaged in training my own AP for a couple of years since I've been out of school, but I have some long-term goals of developing software and training methods for this, coupled of course with further honing of my own skills in a more controlled context. Consider this post a prelude to more scientific findings I hope to come up with in the future!"
Origin of the 'squigly line' used for quarter note rest?,"According to Honegger-Massenkeil, Das Große Lexikon der Musik, published in Freiburg 1982 [an 8 volume reference work], the symbol derived from the semiminima rest. This looks like an uppercase-L turned 90 degrees in clockwise direction hovering between the second and the middle line of a staff counted from the top, so I assume the squigly line was probably the distortion of that symbol caused by handwriting. I found an example in the lilypond documentation here, mirrored below in the middle staff. The first line shows the symbol mentioned by Caleb.  In this Vivaldi autograph facsimile (Concerto RV 107, Fuzeau Editions 5682) two quarter rests occur, which nicely shows an intermediate form and ilustrates, that the staff position was varied:  This Liszt-piece, printed by Diabelli 1838 shows not only another form (mirrored z-like), but by showing a combination of the older mirrored 8th rest and a second one rotated by 180 degrees [two eighth rests gives a quarter rest - mathematically pleasing], also suggests this as possible generation path of the ""squigly"" symbol. "
Why are conductors' movements shifted with respect to the musicians?,"The idea of conducting is to physically demonstrate how you want them to perform. As such, there necessarily will need to be some ""processing time"" built in for the musicians understand the gesture that they're seeing and then translate this into musical sound. I've never seen a ""synchronized"" conducting style, or at least not one that suggested to me the performers were actually reacting to what the conductor was doing. By the very nature of these two concepts, a ""synchronized"" ""reaction"" is impossible. This is even more true when you consider the physical logistics of playing instruments. If we want brass players to play louder, we have to give a gesture before the loud part appears so that the brass players can take the necessary breath to play louder. Similar aspects apply to other instrumental families. In fact, I have a starred quote in my Conducting Technique by Brock McElheran: Remember that you must show the performers what to do BEFORE THEY DO IT."
Why does G# sound right when my melody is in C major?,"I would argue that your melody may not be in C major at all. C major and A natural minor share the same pitches, and your melody is constructed precisely in such a way that it can exist both in C major and in A minor! You might think, ""Well, the first measure emphasizes C and E, which are both members of the C-major tonic triad."" But they're also the third and fifth of A minor! So depending on the harmonic accompaniment you create, your melody may be in A minor the whole time. The G♯ is the leading tone of A minor; it's what helps clarify A as tonic, whereas the G♮ (what we call the ""subtonic"") lacks the same kind of pull upwards towards tonic. The use of a raised scale-degree 7 to create the leading tone is very common in minor keys. Lastly, I'd recommend you doublecheck some of your rhythms. Your half notes in each measure technically create measures of nine eighth notes; these should probably be dotted-quarter notes instead."
Why do some pianists occasionally play their hands at different times?,"Aha, I've found the answer: Asynchrony! Asynchrony is a general term which is used to describe playing notes in a separated or not-quite-together fashion where they are written as if they should normally be played at the same time in the score, for example a chord to which an arpeggiation is applied, or a left-hand bass note and right-hand melody note both written on the same beat but actually played with one hand being placed slightly before the other. It is apparent on many early recordings made of pianists who were born in the nineteenth century and has been the subject of detailed analysis in recent years (see Peres Da Costa’s ‘Off the Record’ cited in the bibliography).  It is an area of performance practice that I find personally very interesting for its role in some of the most exquisite and in other instances most eccentric-seeming performances recorded by such artists.  By incorporating it into my own playing I have found it of great effectiveness in realising the music of Chopin in particular. Chopin as Heard: Asynchrony – An Introductory Case Study So now here’s the resource that my impression of arpeggio rubato is more than only speculation:  Mark Arnest  says in his paper  Why Couldn’t They Play With Their Hands Together?
Noncoordination Between and Within the Hands in 19th Century Piano Interpretation The romantic pianism of a century ago differed from today’s more sober approach in nearly every respect - including attitude towards the text, tempo flexibility, agogic modifications, and even voicing. But no aspect jumps out at a listener more than the noncoordination of the hands: The older pianists don’t keep their hands consistently together. This noncoordination was an almost universal feature of earlier pianism. A study of recordings and piano rolls by 118 pianists born between 1824 and 1880 shows that all but one engaged in the practice so some degree. And he explains why they did it: The purpose of noncoordination was to characterize the music, generally by heightening the expression and clarifying the rhythmic structure. and referring to Malwine Brée, “The Groundwork of the Leschetizky Method,” Haskell House, Arnest quotes: Neither should bass tone and melody-note always be taken precisely together, but the melody note may be struck an instant after the bass, which gives it more relief and a softer effect. “More relief” suggests a musical accent; “a softer effect” could refer to either or both of two things: the acoustic phenomenon in which higher notes appear in the overtone sequence of lower ones, or the idea of rhythmic pulse. and he names 5 reasons for this practice in the Romantic era like  Acoustics (overtones)  Beat versus pulse  Noncoordination as Accent, Separator in Contrapuntal Music and as “Orchestral” Sound. and what they did: Noncoordination as a Form of Tempo Rubato for further reading:  https://www.lib.umd.edu/binaries/content/assets/public/ipam/resources-reviews-and-links/arnest-hands-together-article-pdf-5-15-12.pdf"
Is there a legitimate reason why a C-Clef could ever be used in piano music?,"I don't think a C-clef is necessary. Consider using the treble clef for the top staff, and leaving the upper voice here.
Put the middle voice with the lower, in the bottom staff in bass clef.
If the middle voice gets very high, you can move it from the bottom staff to the top staff.  This gives at most two ledger lines, which is not many at all.
If you think you need to indicate the the middle voice is to be played with the right hand, mark it with m.d."
Why do many classical guitarists move the fingers for vibrato like a violin?,"On both fretted and non-fretted instruments, the vibrato works as a combination of change of resonating length, change of overall length, and change of tension. Many musicians simplify things when they describe how it works, and highlight only one or maybe two of these aspects. The reality is a bit more complex :) The fret-to-string contact is a low mechanical impedance, so it reflects most of the incoming wave energy and establishes a null in the standing wave. The fret contact changes the length of the resonating part of the string. This is the key overlooked point: the overall length of the string and the length of the resonating part of it are independent. Now, a string is a spring. If you press sideways on any linear spring constrained at the ends - be it a piece of wire, or a helical spring from a pen, you make the spring longer. Same happens to the string: it gets longer if you press on it. It happens whether you press it down towards the board, or laterally. You can get fret action without changing the length nor tension of the string. Use a triangular rod, sized to fit exactly between the fingerboard/fretboard and the string, to provide the low mechanical impedance without deflecting the string, and thus without changing its length. You would press the string directly on top of that pseudo-fret to lower the mechanical impedance and improve the quality (q-factor) of the resonating part of the string. But, obviously, on a fretted instrument, you not only bring the string down onto the fret - that already stretches it, but you then bring it further down towards the fretboard, making it even longer. This increases the length of the string, necessarily increasing its tension (unless the tuning pegs are loose). You can see how the string stretches on the diagram below. Imagine that the string was painted in two sections, converging right above the fret when the string is free.  As the string is pressed down, the left (purple) part of it stretches past the fret (compare A, B and C). This is in spite of the length of the resonating string being largely the same in all three cases. Now, when there's a nearby fret, the compliance of the string to lateral deflection (towards the fretboard and/or sideways) isn't constant like it would be in an unfretted instrument. The closer to the fret, the less compliant the spring is. And what does it mean? Suppose you deflect two identical springs the same amount: the more compliant one will experience less tension (tensile stress) than the more rigid (less compliant) one. Thus, a string right behind the fret is a rather nonlinear spring, and the closer to the fret you press it down onto the fretboard, the more tension you introduce into the string. Note that the length of the resonating part of the string has not changed, but the overall length of the string then increases, and the tension in the string increases as well. The higher the tensile stress, the stiffer the string, and the higher the frequency of oscillation, and thus moving the finger towards the fret, while keeping the string down to the fretboards sharpens the note. Of course the compliance of your finger also plays a role: the less compliant it is, the more it emphasizes the change in string's compliance towards the fret. Heavily callused fingers produce higher vibrato pitch range for the same range of finger motion. And of course, we've only mentioned deflections toward the fret/fingerboard. You can also, additionally, deflect the string laterally, to further increase the string tension. And the vibrato can be a combination of rolling motion and sideways motion of the finger. On the diagram below, 1 is the free string, 2 is the string lightly depressed straight down, and 3 is the string bent sideways. "
Operating guitar for 10 years but can't make music,"I'm going against the flow here, but that's no so unusual, and some of the comments have already alluded to this. I hope what I'm going to say does not sound harsh or unsympathetic - I'm just trying to answer this question as it is posed. It also possible that I've missed the mark entirely. Questions like these are often difficult to grasp and answer correctly.  This whole question revolves around ""I tried to learn this... I tried that... still not getting it... Have trouble with the scales, with the theory...""  But I see something missing here: Maybe it's so simple it needn't be stated, but it sounds like your technical and intellectual failures are your main concern, while a musician's concern is always ""I can't hear/perform/write the music."" I think the problem is that you might be putting ""the cart before the horse"". Before you try anything, you have to first TRY YOURSELF:If you have an urge to create music, then you must have music inside of you that wants to be expressed somehow - that's where that urge comes from. Something inside you is inspiring you and producing that urge. So before you do anything - decide on any style or genre or method - you need to discover the music that is inside of you. This might sound very philosophical or abstract, but it really isn't. Listen to music that moves you and inspires you. Sing it over to yourself and digest it - emotionally and sensually - not technically. Hum and sing to yourself that music and expand on it - improvise on it - without any instrument - learn about your own musical mind and sensibilities without any instrument or genre or technique or method.  By doing that, you will discover your own music. Then you must go back and discover which genres and methods will help you to achieve the ultimate goal of every musician: To play and write your own music.  Maybe you need to know lots of scales and theory for your music, maybe you don't. Maybe Flamenco is your thing, maybe it's not - that's all up to you and your music. The problem is not that you're not grasping scales or chords because you don't have a teacher. The problem is that you haven't yet grasped your own music, and what you need to do to make it a reality. Certainly you need a teacher, but before that you need to identify your inner musical urge.  I grew up surrounded by music - jazz, classical, early rock n' roll, show tunes. I began hearing my own music at a young age. I think many of us who are serious musicians share such experiences. That doesn't mean that you can't start later - but you do have to start at some point if you want to make music and not just ""operate the guitar"". This tipped me off to the possible problem/solution: Ten years ago, inspired my Mark Knopfler, I picked the guitar. Had no
  plans becoming a professional musician, just in order to create music
  for myself. I started learning Flamenco... Question: If you were inspired my Mark Knopfler, why did you start learning Flamenco? Why not start with the music that inspired you? (Mark Knopfler's music is also a lot easier than Flamenco). Along those same lines, this question continues.  As I read the question further, I became more and more convinced that was the problem: @Mark2Bra doesn't really know the music he wants to make, so it's possible he'll spend his whole life trying and failing. He's attacking it from ""the outside in"" - trying to learn flamenco and scales and theory and digital piano - but what good will that do when he hasn't yet listened to himself? That being so, I can't agree with answers that are trying to fix certain manifestations of a more fundamental problem, although all the answers contain good advice. Now, i don't believe in the music talent myth Please explain what ""music talent myth"" you are referring to. I know of no such myth. I do know that some people have more musical talent than others, just as some people are better athletes than others, or better writers or better painters.  Perhaps your insistence that ""you don't believe in the music talent myth"" is part of your problem: If you don't believe in your our talent, you will never try to discover it. That's why you are taking what appears to be a mechanical approach to music: You don't know or understand your own talent and you don't believe in ""musical talent"": Therefore you think that if you go through the motions as prescribed. you should get the desired result: Just like when solving an equation. But making music is not like solving an equation: It's an expressive art form, not a mechanical or mathematical process. Further - Quoting your question:
Operating guitar for 10 years but can't make music.
Nobody operates a guitar. We play the guitar, we don't operate it.  For a musician, a musical instrument is not a machine or some cold distant object that needs to be operated by following a set of instructions. It's their voice, and true vocalists are also musicians. One listen to Ella Fitzgerald proves that. Musicians don't operate their instruments - they play - any more than vocalists operate their voices - they sing. If you watch the great players, their instruments are extensions of their bodies, used for expressing their music. They are not devices to be operated. No operations going on here: 





 I have a strong spatial intelligence - I think in pictures and have a
  relatively good memory for I can recall memories by ""looking at them"" What does any of that have to do with making music? I don't recall ever hearing or reading that a great musician or composer was blessed with ""strong spatial intelligence"".  As for ""thinking in pictures"", perhaps that's not the best way for a musician to think - many of our great musicians were blind, and music is about sound and feelings, not pictures.  Strong  spatial intelligence and thinking in pictures would appear to be great strengths for an artist or sculptor, not a musician. I am not saying you don't have musical talent/aptitude - many people are blessed with multiple talents. I'm just not sure what those abilities have to do with making music.  This leads me back to the impression I'm getting that you have not yet heard your own music, and so you're not taking a musical approach to your musical endeavors. When you discover your music - tap into your own musical talent - your own inner musical ear - you will not be talking about ""spatial intelligence and thinking in pictures"". You will be talking about sounds and feelings and how to create them and capture them."
Why is a doubling of frequency called an octave?,"First, let's be clear that the standard (major) musical scale divides the octave into seven parts, not eight.  The word ""octave"" comes from eight, because a unison (two notes sounding at the same frequency) is considered to be a ""prime"" or kind of a ""one"" in the system, rather than zero.  Thus, the first interval created between a note and the next note above it is called a ""second,"" even though it's only one interval. This is just a historical convention for naming musical intervals, which sort of originated by counting both endpoints in an interval.  For example, a musical ""fifth"" (frequency ratio 3:2) is the interval created by two notes that are four steps apart.  So, C-D-E-F-G creates a fifth between C and G.  The interval is five notes, but there are only four ""steps"" (of various sizes). Anyhow, you need to get past that quirky numbering system first.  So, I believe your question then becomes: why do we divide the octave into seven parts? There are many longer answers here on this topic.  But the gist is that like the octave (frequency ratio 2:1), small whole-number ratios of frequencies are often heard as ""consonant.""  So the ratio 3:2 between frequencies sounds good (and, as noted, creates an interval called a perfect fifth), as well as the ratio 4:3 (the so-called perfect fourth). The ancient Pythagoreans recognized the importance of these intervals (2:1 octave, 3:2 perfect fifth, and 4:3 perfect fourth).  They also recognized that the difference between the size of the 3:2 and 4:3 ratios was useful, an interval with a frequency ratio of 9:8, which eventually became known as a ""whole step."" So far, if you combine these ratios within one octave, you can build a perfect fifth and fourth up from the bottom note, as well as a perfect fifth and fourth down from the top note.  The meet in the middle around a 9:8 ""whole step.""  In musical notes, this would for example outline the notes E-A-B-E within an octave.  (As I noted in comments, this overall can be thought of as a 12:9:8:6 ratio between four notes, which was how the Pythagoreans thought of it.) Again, all of this dates to ancient Greece and is built on fundamental consonant intervals/ratios.  The question then is how to fill out the rest of the notes within that octave.  And the Greeks had a lot of answers to that, with a lot of different tuning systems. But one possibility that they settled on was called a ""diatonic"" system, which literally means ""through whole tones"" (i.e., those 9:8 ratios I mentioned).  They took that interval that originated as a difference between the 3:2 fifth and the 4:3 fourth and started tuning 9:8 ""whole steps"" to create a scale, starting at the top. In musical terms, this was like going E-D-C down the scale.  But they had already built B and A after that.  So then once they got to A, they built more whole tones going down A-G-F.  Then you had a complete scale going down an octave: E-D-C-B-A-G-F-E.  Most of the intervals were those 9:8 ""whole tones.""  But a couple (C-B and F-E) were smaller intervals with really odd mathematical ratios.  In effect, the Greeks didn't care about those ratios so much: they just cared about tuning the other notes, and those left over small bits were kind of like the ""errors"" that were left over in tuning. What you then have is seven intervals within an octave creating the diatonic scale, which survives to the present day. As to how this relates to the 12-note chromatic scale -- well, some Greeks (particularly a guy named Aristoxenus) realized that those little left over bits in the scale were about the size of intervals that could almost divide the octave into 12 equal bits.  They were a little bit off, though.  Similarly, those little bits were roughly one half the size of the 9:8 whole tone interval. Over the centuries once harmony developed more, there were various reasons that the 12-note chromatic equal division seemed to be better than the one constructed with the simple 3:2, 4:3, and 9:8 ratios.  That's a much more complex story (the story of musical temperament). But hopefully this explains the gist of why a 7-interval division of the ""octave"" developed historically."
What is the difference between monitors and (loud)speakers in technical terms?,"There are (at least) two types of speakers referred to as monitors, and (at least) two types of speakers referred to as loudspeakers: studio monitors -- speakers that are specifically designed to have flat response, minimal distortion and so on.  Their intended use is in the context of a recording studio to provide unadulterated playback of the recorded material. live monitors -- speakers that are used during live performance (sometimes for playback during recording) so that the performer can hear what they, and the rest of the ensemble are doing.  These need to be loud enough for the situation at hand, and need balanced output, but don't need the pristine characteristics of studio monitors.  Often, these are wedges positioned at the front of the stage, projecting back towards the ensemble. live loudspeakers -- the speakers that are used to project the sound of the performer out to the audience.  More often these are referred to as ""PA"".  Here overall power, and distortion free operation are the prime considerations.  Some deviations from perfectly flat frequency response are sometimes acceptable, esp. if other speakers, e.g. sub-woofers, can fill in the missing signal. stereo loudspeakers -- the speakers used to project the sound for home audio systems.  These are tuned to produced sound that is more pleasing for listening entertainment. The important difference between stereo loudspeakers and studio monitors is that the former are often voiced in a way that affects sound away from what is recorded; e.g. some may be bass heavy, or have a smile shaped frequency response curve etc.  Ideally, studio monitors do not introduce any color of their own, but, again ideally, perfectly reproduce the recorded sound being played back on them.  This reflects the different purposes: the former are designed for enjoyment, the later are designed for critical listening."
What does one need to know to learn to improvise with other musicians?,"Not knowing your particular background or skill level the question is incredibly broad. From the point of view of an experienced improviser what's going on here is fundamentally very simple. Pianist 1 is playing around in A minor. If you don't have the ability to recognise a pitch from memory (perfect pitch, I don't have it and it's a very rare ability) then it will take some little initial guess, or watching the pianists fingers for the notes they are using, to determine the key. A bit of aural skill helps here, as in after a few seconds listening you hear they are going to a home chord of some kind of minor tonic. Pianist 2 looks at pianist 1's hands and see's there are no flats or sharps used, so it must be in C or A minor (or some mode, but that would sound 'different' and is less likely to be the case in the majority of simple jams like this). Next up he determines it sounds minor, so it's probably A minor. Although this is easy to determine with a bit of practice, especially when you are hearing someone play diatonically, if there was any doubt in pianist 2's mind that it was an a minor tonic and not another minor chord from our diatonic list of chords a quick peek at pianist 1's hands and what keys he is playing would answer any question right away, it all looks familiar, uses all the white notes and ends on an A minor, it's in A minor. Pianist 1 is playing two chords to reach the final one. Given that we are probably in the key of A minor (down to seeing the lack of black keys pianist 1 is playing) now a bit of ear training will quickly tell you that the approaching chords are from the same key as the home chord, and a bit of knowledge of chord theory will tell you that the chords that reside under the tonic of A minor, stepwise, are F major and G major. This sounds a little abstract, but as almost all music obeys, to some degree, the patterns found in the diatonic major/minor scale remembering the order of chords (and how they sound) becomes second nature, as you have to recall it so often. So we are left with pianist 2 having identified pianist 1 is in A minor, and playing the two chords below it to lead up to the tonic. Although I don't have perfect pitch and couldn't accurately guess that it was in A minor without looking at the video or grabbing an instrument it's very easy to hear that we are going 'IV V vi' in some key. This may be familier to you, but if not you just need to look into 'chords in a major scale' and 'relative minors', then spend a bit of time playing around until you start to hear the relationships and recognise the movements we have here. In time you can listen to a chord sequence and make a pretty good guess at what's going on before even playing a note. After that, it's simply 'variations on a theme'. The two pianists are now feeding off each other and reacting to the confidence built each time the chord sequence is completed in such a way that they are able to experiment a little, confident that they can predict the next chord based on the repetition. Then you can just try out different techniques. Pianist 2 is accompanying, broadly, and varies the way he plays the chords with arpeggios, a bit of stride playing and some melodic playing. Pianist 1 is then free to worry less about the chord accompaniment and focus' on melodic playing around the A minor scale. He plays it safe, sticking mainly to minor pentatonic playing with the odd passing note, following the basic rules of beginner improvising ie. stick to strong chord tones, resolve nicely each time the sequence ends etc. Playing it safe is absolutely fine in this kind of impromptu jam. Developing your own feel for how to improvise a melody is something with no strict rules, it's on-the-spot composing in some way, but with a bit of practice you can find some ways that make your ideas sound more lyrical, and more musical. Very broadly these can be; Don't start on the 1 of each chord all the time. Don't start on beat one of each chord all the time. Try and construct short phrases, like sentences, that have a beggining, middle and end. Repeat ideas to build up a sense of some kind of intent,
develop a phrase once it's established. These are a very simple starting points, I could carry on writing arbitrary ideas like this for days, and in the video the musicians don't follow even points 1 and 2 of these very much at all. They make up for it by following points 3 and 4 quite nicely, and after all this is a jam at a train station between strangers, not a composed piece! It's a form of very simple improvisation demonstrated very well in an odd, impromptu setting. I don't mean to sound derogatory to the musicians, it really is a good example of how you can get something basic going between two stranger-musicians with no forward planning. I would suggest just playing the chords, F  G  Am  Am (as they are here) in your left hand and just noodle in the right hand on the white keys and you'll get something similar. Once you have gotten used to that you can explore how to embellish it in ANY direction, from additional notes, chord extensions, different keys, different techniques etc. The biggest thing to learn will be the sound of each note choice on each chord, get used to how some sound simple or sombre, some sound exciting, some sound floaty, some sound beautiful. Build up a dictionary of what intervals sound like to you. After that it's phrasing of melodies in the right hand. Once you are satisfied with that stuff and want more then you just add ever more complex chord sequences, new sounds and techniques until you get to jazz and beyond!"
What are the advantages of WAV vs. MP3?,The executive summary of Charles' very detailed answer is:
Why can't we leave all mics on during a gig?,"Well, every mic you toss into the mix also adds more ambience, a bit of feedback from PA and monitors, and will pick up sounds that aren't really supposed to be heard at all, like breathing. Now, this isn't necessarily bad – in particular in the studio, I rather like the compact room sensation caused by many mics picking up bleed from different sources. However, in a live situation you more typically can't avoid hearing too much of the (less than ideal, acoustically) room, you already have plenty enough background noise from the crowd to fight with, and you're close to getting feedback problems. All of these issues are exacerbated by many open mics on stage.Thus, yes, the fewer open mics on stage the better is a pretty good guideline for live sound. Nevertheless, I don't agree with Tim and would in fact support your husband's complaint. I used to always turn off unused channels too when mixing bands live, but don't do that anymore now, except for particularly troublesome sources (mostly quiet acoustic instruments). In most cases, you will need to have all channels on at some point anyway, so you need to somehow make sure the mix sounds good even then. If anything is really close to feedback, then the sound will probably be destroyed by resonances already, so the only fix is to go back to the cause. Make sure the overall sound level is quiet enough, optimise the mic positions, tell the guitarist to turn his bleeding amp down a bit... tell the vocalist to make proper use of the mic, as well...
Such measures tend to have a much stronger effect on the final sound than turning down a few vocal mics, which, if placed cleverly, don't generally pick up that much unwanted sound. Overhead drum mics are more of an inevitable troublemaker in that regard. As you say, any mic that's turned off is a risk of humilation for both singer and engineer, also a typical cause of overly hectic search for the problem, possibly dabbling with the wrong channel... it's just not worth it. Even if the engineer gets every mute right, that alone will keep them somewhat busy and distract from other things that might be more important to worry about. Better just pull the level of those channels down a couple dB, that usually already lets any interference become a non-issue yet if someone is determined to get through to the audience they'll be able to do it, albeit less than easily until the engineer gets the level right again. A compromise that's getting ever more popular on these days' digital consoles is to just put noise gates on every channel. That certainly avoids breathing etc. to be heard in pauses, though it doesn't generally work that great for avoiding bleed (nor feedback, as Aaron remarks), because either you need to put the threshold so high that quietly sung or spoken parts get chopped up, or louder passages will have bleed from other instruments (particularly snare and guitars) trigger the gate open. Therefore I prefer to set the gates expansion ratio only to something low like 3:1, which gives a similar compromise to only slightly pulling down unused channels: unwanted noise will vanish in the mix, but important yet not-that-loud contributions will at least be audible at all."
Should low frequency players anticipate in orchestra?,"I don't have an answer for you with measurements in milliseconds, etc., but as a tuba player I can give you my experiences. I'm not consciously thinking of anticipating anything in order to get my sound out because my instrument is bigger. Instead, the training I've received over time just naturally tells me what I need to do in order for my sound to come out when I want it. In other words, it just becomes second nature, and so for us it's not an issue of ""anticipating,"" but rather just playing like we know how to. It's a little like throwing or kicking a ball, I guess. You don't stop and measure wind velocity and angles and things like that; instead, over time you just naturally know that when it feels like this when you throw/kick, the ball will be sent over here. More problematic is the location within the orchestra; sometimes the tuba player can be a solid 50 feet from the conductor (and I've seen much greater distances than that!). In this situation, if I and the concertmaster both begin a pitch at the same time, my sound will reach the conductor (and thus the audience) at a slightly different time. As such, I do find myself occasionally anticipating the conductor in situations like this, especially when my lines match something being played with instruments right at the front of the stage. But this is much more problematic for percussionists, who are even farther back on the stage. Thus (in my opinion) it's less about size and low frequencies that take longer to travel, and more about simple placement within the orchestra."
Three diagonal lines that cross through both staves,"In my opinion you're correct. I haven't seen them like in your example yet, but for me this seems like a repeat sign. Usually they have a dot on each side and are often found in drum parts for example:  They are called 'Simile marks' and can also have more than one slash. One slash would usually mean to repeat the previous measure, two slashes would usually mean to repeat the previous two measures and so on....  So In this case it seems like to just repeat the last three measures. First because of the three slashes... and also because it's spread over three measures."
How to identify the guitar chords of a song,"At a beginner level, the first step is to identify the root note of the chord - this is often (especially in most pop or rock music) the lowest note of the chord, so you should be able to hear and compare with a plucked note on your guitar. If you can accompany a song just using the root notes then you will have an idea of the chords and the progression through the song. Identifying whether it is an A minor, A 7th, A sus 4 etc comes more from practice and experience. You learn to hear what each type of chord sounds like and will be able to play along with a version of the chord. Once you can do that, you are likely to find that although the chords may be right, you may be playing a different fingering than is used on the track. There are many ways to play each chord, not just because you can play in various places on the fretboard, but also because you don't need to have the notes in order, or even play all the notes in a chord, so to accurately play in the style of a particular artist, you need to learn their techniques - they may go for basic powerchords, or like to stretch across a wide range of frets etc."
"""inuendo"" in a piano score","Is it possible there is a ""dim"" around m. 25 or so? Often a composer (or in this case, an editor) will request that an expression marking takes place over a span of time instead of instantaneously. One such standard marking is ""diminuendo,"" which instructs the performer to gradually get softer. It sounds like the ""inuendo"" is simply the latter portion of a larger ""diminuendo"" marking. As such, begin getting softer at the appearance of ""dim"" and reach the new dynamic after the ""inuendo""; in many cases, the composer will give a new dynamic marking at that point."
Why are modern string bows concave instead of convex?,"It's a fun experience to play with a convex Baroque bow, but if you've ever tried to use it for anything romantic or later, you'll quickly want to get back to the concave Tourte design that everybody has nowadays. The thing with convex bows is that they bounce around like mad. This can work quite well for the elegant-rhythmic dance feel of Baroque and early Classical music. But it works completely against you if you need biting attack and/or dramatic long tenuto notes. With such a playing style, a baroque bow feels like immersing styrofoam in water: the string seems to outright repel the bow. Whereas a Tourte bow can pretty easily be forced to “sink into he string” for straight sustained notes. Some “historically informed” performers do use convex bows for Baroque music, but it's not like a Tourte bow doesn't still have some bounce and can convey that gracious character, especially when held in “Baroque position” (i.e. closer to the center of gravity, rather than right at the frog)."
What are the disadvantages of buying a short-scale bass guitar,"Volume is obviously not the only aspect of an instrument's sound: frequency distribution, attack characteristics, sustain, tuning accuracy etc. are equally or more important. Short scales tend to (but don't necessarily) result in Most of this seems technically disadvantageous, but how good or bad it is musically depends on the context and playing style. The sound of many Beatles songs is influenced quite heavily by McCartney's Höfner bass, in part by the fact that it's short-scale. The same sound would probably not work very well in, say, a funk rock or metal band. On the other hand, it's of course not only the scale that makes up the sound. If you put bright-sounding strings on a 30"" with low-impedance active electronics and tune it up to A, you get much the opposite of the characteristics described above: a glassy piccolo-sound well-suited for playing soloes."
"Are there reliable, formulaic ways to form chords on the guitar?","Just like piano, you have to know the instrument to comfortably be able to form chords; unlike piano, most notes on the guitar can be played in the same octave at 3, 4, 5 locations on the fretboard. This makes it challenging to develop a mental map of the fretboard, and it may seem like a daunting project at first. Systems like CAGED (which I am frankly not too excited about) are supposed to assist you in developing a such a mental map, and they can be somewhat helpful in this regard. CAGED in particular seems most useful in helping to connect scale patterns to chord tones, but I personally don't think that it has much value in helping one understand how to voice chords on the neck. You need to get a basic collection of chord shapes under your hands so that you can play them without thinking, and in such a way that you know what note each finger is covering. If you can develop an instant recognition of the notes on the fingerboard, that is helpful (and I would suggest working on this), but what you really need to know is which note is the root, which the third, and so on. A very useful way to begin is to get comfortable with some basic chord voicing types, learning how to modify those as needed. Here is how I suggest proceeding: One useful strategy for learning the fingerboard is to focus on string groups. Learn how to play the triads (major, minor, augmented, and diminished) on each of the four 3-string groups, in root position and both inversions. While you are doing this, stay aware of where the root is, where the third is, and where the fifth is. Just like piano, to turn one of the shapes above into a minor triad, lower the third; to turn one of the shapes into an augmented triad, raise the fifth. It would probably be a good idea to spend a week focused on each string group. Practice in every key; try playing common progressions (in every key); try mixing in inversions. If you don't already know about shell voicings, learn about them now. Shell voicings contain the root, third, and seventh of a chord (the root and the guide tones); these voicings capture the essential character of seventh chords, and are a really useful tool to have in your kit. These are great for when you are playing from a chart that you have never seen before and you need to simplify the harmony as you begin to find your way. They are also somewhat spare, so they leave some space for other players to fill in. Pay attention to where the root is, where the third is, and where the seventh is. Lower the third to make a m7 chord; raise the seventh to make a M7 chord; lower the third and raise the seventh to make a mM7 chord; drop the seventh by a whole-step to make a sixth chord. You could try to learn the inversions with these, but I would just focus on learning them in root position to start. Try them in common chord progressions; play them in every key. If you don't already know about drop voicings, learn about them now. To start, I would focus on drop-2 voicings (I have shown some drop-2 voicings above), and maybe add drop-3 voicings after you get good with those. They are very common on both piano and guitar, and provide a systematic way to think about a lot of seventh chord voicings. As with the other voicings, pay attention to where the root is, where the third is, where the fifth is, and where the seventh is. Move these notes around to get 7 chords, m7 chords, m7b5 chords, 7#5 chords, M7#5 chords, etc. Learn all of the inversions, and practice them in common chord progressions in every key. When you start working with drop voicings, you will find that some fingerings are difficult to play at first, and sometimes when you modify a shape to create a new chord you end up with an unplayable fingering, meaning that you may need to find a new fingering for that chord voicing, or you may need to try another voicing altogether. If this all seems like a lot of work, it is. There are really only a few types of chord voicings listed above, but there is a lot to do in order to really get those voicings under your hands. Once you do that, you will have a good base to build on, but almost immediately you will be able to apply these voicings to real music. Even if you are shaky on the inversions, having a command of the root position voicings I listed above will give you a lot to use. When you encounter a chord that you want to play, try to see how it fits with the voicings you know. Shell voicings are particularly useful for this in that they give you the root, third, and seventh, which you can modify to get the right type of seventh chord, and add notes or extensions to color. Need to play a G7#11? Take a G7 shell voicing and add a #11 (or think of it as a G7b5 and add a b5): Need to play a CMaj9? Take a CMaj7 shell voicing and add a 9: Note that the fingerings in the above G7#11 and CMaj9 chords take the shell voicings shown earlier, but use different fingers for some of the notes. It is important to be able to play any chord shape using as many different fingering options as you can. ggcg makes good points about this in his answer below. Especially with simple shapes like the triads and shell voicings shown above, practice playing them using different fingers, and practice using different fingerings to move from one shape to the next; when you find a rough patch in a chord change, figure out an efficient fingering and practice it. Eventually your fingers will know where to go and how to get there. You really do need to know the notes on the fingerboard well, but the way of thinking I have described above is more about knowing where the chord tones and chord extensions are in relation to chord shapes that you already know. Once you gain some facility with this, you will be an unstoppable chording machine."
Why does this note have a stem pointing up and another pointing down?,"Dave is right, but there's a little more to it.  You can break the part up into two different lines. One that looks like this:  And another that looks like this:  When you put them together, you get the two part represented by different stems. It's pretty much telling you to hold the first note for the length of a quarter note, but play the set of notes while the first is sustained. "
"B -> C and E -> F, No Sharp?","Note: For the sake of discussion, I'm limiting myself here to equal temperaments, which is the most common way of tuning keyboards. Other systems exist, of course, but would probably only confuse the matter. Why do B and C and E and F not have a sharp note between them? Simply because, acoustically speaking, there is no room in our current system for another pitch between B and C, or E and F. The scale was originally conceived of as a 7 note scale, with the notes A, B, C, D, E, F, G. However, these 7 notes are not equally distributed throughout the octave. Most of these pitches are a whole step above the previous one, but there is only a half step between the B and C, and between the E and F. But sometimes, we want to move around where this half step occurs. For example, if we were playing in the key of G, we want a half step between the F and the G, but not between the E and the F. The solution is to bump up the F's pitch by a half step, which makes it a whole step higher than the E, and just a half step under the G. This ""bumped up"" higher version of F, we call F♯. A sharp always refers to raising the pitch by a half step, and a flat always refers to lowering the pitch by a half step. This is true regardless of whether the resulting pitch is a white or black key on the keyboard. From this, you can see that a B♯, for example, is a half step higher than a regular B. But you'll notice there is already a key on the keyboard that sounds a half step higher than B -- we usually call it C, but B♯ is also a perfectly valid name for that note, in the proper context (for example, the key of C♯ would contain a B♯ -- this occurs in Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata). Similarly, the note B can be called a C♭ in the proper context (such as in an A♭ minor chord). Granted, these don't come up very often, because writing in a key that requires them means reading/playing a lot of sharps or flats, which can often be tricky, but they do show up when needed. Would this make a piano harder to play in some way? This brings up an interesting question. If you wanted to, you could lay out the keyboard so that it consists of perfectly alternating black and white keys. However, what you would have to do is make F, G, A, and B become new black keys, and make the three black keys in between them become new white keys. This would leave you with 6 black keys and 6 white keys, which would look a bit like this: [C] [C♯/D♭] [D] [D♯/E♭] [E] [F] [F♯/G♭] [G] [G♯/A♭] [A] [A♯/B♭] [B]. In some ways, this kind of keyboard would actually be a better representation of the ""shape"" of the musical scale. So why don't we use it? I can think of two reasons. The first, obviously, is historical reasons. Never underestimate the importance of tradition. As I mentioned earlier, music was originally (and still is) based around a seven note scale, as depicted by the white keys. The earliest tuning systems didn't really permit the use of playing other keys (that's why everything was limited to modes), so it made no sense to treat the black keys as equal. In fact, the keyboard seems to predate the use of sharp and flat notes, although the current arrangement of keys is very old, and has survived the test of time (see: Origin of the asymmetrical keyboard layout of a piano). The second reason is simply because it is useful to have these gaps -- it provides tactile feedback to help a player orient themselves along the scale. Pretty much the first thing every piano student learns is to locate ""C"", to the left of the two black keys. If we had a perfectly symmetrical layout (like a guitar fretboard), it might be easier to lose track of where you are in the scale. Is there anything in music theory, as it stands, that prevents these notes?  As mentioned above, notes like B♯ do already exist, and do get used, but they do not need a separate key on the keyboard, because B and C are already only a half step apart, so a B♯ is effectively the same pitch as C. If you were to add new keys, you would have to figure out how you wanted them tuned, because in the current system of 12 equally-spaced half steps, there is no room for another note in between B and C, or E and F. This introduces the somewhat esoteric concept of microtonality, and multiple tunings, of which there are an infinite number of possibilities. I'll only mention two obvious choices, for brevity. You might try tuning these new keys exactly in between the existing two pitches (and keep all the other pitches the same). In this case, you've just added notes that are a quarter step away, but there are no other quarter steps anywhere on the keyboard, so you'd be introducing microtonalism in a very restricted way. Why should quarter steps only exist between those two pairs of notes, instead of between every pair of notes a half step apart? If you do that, you've just recreated 24-tone equal tuning (you aren't the first). This doubles the amount of notes available to you, so what are you going to do with them all? I believe you are correct about the symbol for the B half-sharp, but note that this would not be equivalent to B♯ (which is still equal to C). Another option is to notice that you've now got 14 notes in each octave, and split the octave into 14 equal parts (moving the pitches of all the existing notes accordingly), unfortunately, such a scale does not do a good job of approximating many consonant intervals, and it would not be very suitable for traditional western music. Experimental musicians have used it though."
"My guitar goes out of tune at a higher pitch rather than lower, is that normal?","Your strings have gained tension due to the change in temperature and humidity causing the wood of your guitar to expand and contract. Metal strings don't expand or contract enough to cause detectable tuning issues alone. The wood of your guitar, however, does. The truss rod does the best job it can for keeping your neck at the right angle relative to the body, but it's not perfect. A slight movement of the neck backwards (towards the z axis relative to the body of the guitar) will cause your strings to go sharp enough for your ear to discern. You can test further this by playing open strings and pushing on the headstock in different directions perpendicular to the body of the guitar--just don't push too hard. As relative humidity changes, the wood of the body and neck of a guitar will expand and contract in two ways: tangentially and radially. Tangential movement lies parallel to the growth rings of the wood while radial movement is perpendicular across the growth rings. Another thing to consider is that different species of wood are more hygroscopic than others. This simply means that one species, take Maple with a radial growth coefficient of 0.00353 for example, will absorb more water--and thus move more--than another species like Cherry that has a lower radial growth coefficient of 0.00248. So, while the neck of your guitar gains or looses moisture, the wood will expand and contract relative to one of the two directions I explained earlier. This movement in either direction can very well be enough to cause more tension on the strings, thus bending them sharp. A great article explaining all this a little more lives here. It's about cabinets, but very much applies to anything made of wood because the physical properties are universal. Also, another list of some common woods and their growth dimension coefficients is here. According to that book mahogany is on the lower end of the spectrum, so it doesn't move very much. However maple, a very popular wood for guitar necks, tends to move a lot tangentially (parallel to the growth rings, or grain of the wood) and consequently is a little more susceptible to changes in humidity. So there's the physics of it :D. In the end, the environment your instrument lives in is very much an factor to it's overall health--especially if it's made of real wood. Also, see the answers on this question for other ideas as to why your guitar goes out of tune (usually)."
Why are thirds used to construct chords?,"A chord does not have to be made up of thirds. A chord is by definition two or more notes heard as if sounded simultaneously. Not all chords have three notes either. There are dyads (two notes), triads (three), tetrachords (four), pentachords (five), and hexachords (six). There's no limit on the number of notes, and also, by definition, there's no limits on which notes. C - E - G  is a chord. D - E - F - C is a chord. However, the most common triads are the major, minor, augmented, and diminished (there is also the suspended). All of these are composed of a  root, a third, and a fifth (except the suspended, which uses the root, perfect fourth and perfect fifth). So, now to your question, why thirds? First, realize there are two types of thirds: the major and the minor. The major consists of four semitones and the minor three semitones. Quoting Wikipedia: The major third is classed as an imperfect consonance and is considered one of the most consonant intervals after the unison, octave, perfect fifth, and perfect fourth. In the common practice period, thirds were considered interesting and dynamic consonances along with their inverses the sixths. After the major third became established as such, it become pretty standard. Every classical piece makes use of it in some way. The other reason the major third is so widely used is that it is found in the harmonic series (between the fourth and fifth). Early brass (e.g., posthorn, natural trumpet) had no valves or slides and were limited to the harmonic series. This encouraged use of and familiarity with the major third. However, I'd say the most important of all these reasons is the first. It is highly consonant. The minor third has the same level of consonance as the major third, but is found higher up in the harmonic series (between fifth and sixth). Also, there are many common transposing instruments which sound a minor third higher or lower form where they are written. For example, the Eb clarinet and the Eb trumpet both sound a minor third higher than written. The oboe d'amore, popular in the eighteenth and twentieth centuries, and the soprano clarinet in A sound a minor third higher than written. Of these reasons, I'd say the first (again) is the most important. As for other intervals, any interval can be used, but some are more common than others. The perfect fifth, octave, unison, and seventh (in no particular order) are very common. All major, minor, and suspended chords have a perfect fifth. Also important are the perfect second, perfect fourth, and major sixth. To learn more about different chords and the intervals that make them up, read this article on intervals and this one on chords. They are both very informative. Why thirds? Thirds are the most consonant intervals (after the unison, octave, perfect fifth, and perfect fourth). Are other intervals sometimes used? Many other intervals are used. See here for a list of the main ones. They include the perfect fifth, the perfect seventh, the octave, the major sixth and the perfect fourth."
Where can I get started with my improvisation?,"Great Question, Edgar! I'm guessing if you've played some of the Real Book and such that you've heard of Jamey Aebersold.  If not, you definitely need to check him out and volumes 1, 2, 3, and 54 are very common for beginners. However, if you've exhausted the Jamey Aebersold path and are still unsure of where to go, my best advice is to listen to Jazz Greats, listen to them again, and then listen some more.  The best jazz musicians constantly listened to recordings and played along with them and/or transcribed (analyzing, if you have the theoretical background to) the solos.  While you're listening you should be targeting your favorite licks.  For me this is one.  You need to find what saxophonists inspire you the most and learn their licks (such as Charlie Parker).  After you learn their licks, learn them in every key.  This is a common right of passage for all aspiring jazz musicians.  As far as the legality of the issue, I cannot make a fully informed comment, but I can tell you it'd probably be bad news to steal another players lick and use it in a recorded commercially released CD.  However, the culture of jazz is such that some players might do that and it'd be regarded as a ""tip of the hat"" to who ever you were quoting.  If you can't afford to buy an entire jazz library, YouTube has some great videos and you can ask your teachers about the best jazz saxophonists for you to listen to right now or explore the world wide web yourself.  While the above is the most important thing you should be doing, you have other things you can do to develop raw material.  The Vol 3 of the Aebersold has a variety of exercises over the ii-V-I progression (which is one of the most commom ones, you'll see in jazz.  The entirety of ""Autumn Leaves"" is a collection of ii-V-I progressions) that you should learn in every key. Additionally, take all the jazz scales you know and play them in thirds.  For instance (in eighth notes):
Bb-D-C-Eb-D-F-Eb-G-F-A-G-Bb-A-C-Bb.  Bb-G-A-F-G-Eb-F-D-Eb-C-D-Bb-C-A-Bb.  You can do this same pattern with any of the scales that Jamey Aebersold includes in his books (though I think it sounds awkward used on the blues scale).   Lastly, using all of your new found knowledge of what is idiomatic to jazz, write your own licks, learn them in all keys.  While you are unlikely to ever hear someone call out ""Autumn Leaves in Gb minor!"" at a jam session, your hard work will allow you to take all of the fantastic ideas you have, and put them out on the horn. What all of these activities have in common is they drill patterns into your fingers so that playing this lick or that scale become as automatic and easy to you as when you play a concert Bb scale.  I can't count the number of times I've found myself quoting another jazz head while improvising because I've played it so many times.  People quoting ""If I Only Had a Brain"" became an inside joke in my jazz band.   I will add one more thing, and that's imitation work.  If you can find a cooperative friend who wants to play material with you, challenge the other person by playing something and having them imitate you without looking or reading music.  Stat simple and get more complicated as you progress during the session.  However, the goal is to learn, so if the person didn't get the lick right, play it again, emphasizing what they missed.  Keep going (and simplifying if necessary) until they get it.  Use your best judgment when you're challenging your partner too much. So in order of importance: For theory, this was recommended to me.  I honestly haven't read it, and can't vouch for it personally but it has been widely recommended to me and often referred to as ""The Bible.""  Jazz theory can get insanely complicated.  I'll leave pursuing it to your discretion. Keep in mind that jazz music start from and aural tradition, and very many jazz musicians haven't read music.  Buddy Rich being among one of the more recent ones I know of.  Learning by ear is something I fully endorse and is how I learned.  Music theory came from analyzing the works of those such as J.S. Bach and figuring out what they did where and why they did it.  Jazz theory has a history, and many players just toyed around with what they heard until they liked it (Notably, John Coltrane). ""If it sounds good, it is good""- Duke Ellington"
"Pick weight - functional difference, or just personal preference?","You are right that picks are generally thin, medium, heavy. Some picks are by mm, but it's really just a different measurement of the same thing. Some manufacturers will add super / extra thin or heavy.  You do get a different sound with different picks. There is a maximum amount of force you can apply with a pick, given it's thickness. This will affect the tone you are generating.  I think that heavier picks have a strong advantage, as you can make them ""softer"" by not gripping them as tightly. They get more ""give"" although, it's really in your fingers, the effect is the same. You cannot make a thin pick stronger though. When I was learning, I liked thin picks though as they were easier to play fast with. However, technique solves that problem.  It is largely personal though. I suggest you try a couple out and see what works for you. "
Practice amount and habits for time constrained individuals,"These are all good points, and the question of appropriateness of practice here is valid.
I'm going to share some views here that hopefully yourself and other amateur (that is, non-professional, not lacking in skill) musicians can adopt in their attitude and approach to their instrument. As an aside to the person who mentioned your ""measly"" practice time wouldn't be enough - it all depends on what you're trying to do.  If you're trying to get into a top orchestra, then I'd be inclined to agree.  If your goal is trying to learn a song so you can play for friends, family, or yourself, then they are being foolish.  I have friends that practice for 5+ hours a day and complained about it - I practiced an hour a day and achieved the same skill level.  There is no substitute for effective time management, clearly defined goals, and a passionate, enthusiastic disposition for hard work. Hope that helps."
Why do listeners hear the lowest note of a chord most distinctly?,"The answer lies in the realm of Psychoacoustics and/or Music Psychology.  I studied a little of this in Audio Engineering, and from what I remember it has to do with how our primary auditory cortex in the brain processes vibration pulses that we hear as a tone.  Lower tones are given more ""weight"" than higher frequencies, especially when determining what the ""Fundamental Frequency"" is.  I'm not sure why, but I know testing has been done on the subject. Additional harmonic tones added to the chord can help the brain recognize the fundamental.  This is likely why putting the chord pitch in the bass note is so effective. The 5th, being harmonically related can also work and not mask the perception of the fundamental.  Putting the 3rd in the base can cause confusion about which frequency the fundamental is. You can try this yourself on a keyboard:  play a root position C chord in the right hand, and play a low C in the bass with it. Then switch the low note to a G and listen to the difference. Finally put a low E in the bass and you will hear how the chord doesn't sound as ""C ish""."
Falsetto voice in women,"Wikipedia says: The issue of the female falsetto voice has been met with some
  controversy, especially among vocal pedagogists. Many books on the art
  of singing completely ignore this issue, simply gloss over it, or
  insist that women do not have falsetto. This controversy, however,
  does not exist within the speech pathology community and arguments
  against the existence of female falsetto do not align with current
  physiological evidence. Motion picture and video studies of laryngeal
  action reveal that women can and do produce falsetto, and
  electromyographic studies by several leading speech pathologists and
  vocal pedagogists provide further confirmation. One possible explanation for this failure to recognize the female
  falsetto is the fact that the difference in timbre and dynamic level
  between the modal and falsetto registers often is not as pronounced in
  female voices as it is in male voices. This is due in part to the
  difference in the length and mass of the vocal folds and to the
  difference in frequency ranges. It is an established fact that
  women have a falsetto register and that many young female singers
  substitute falsetto for the upper portion of the modal voice. So there you go. Females can and do achieve falsetto. The Wikipedia article contains citations, should you wish to follow up."
Properly fingering jazz chords?,"One of the best ways is to play scales using chords. Set up a metronome, and change a chord on every forth beat. Choose a slower tempo if you can't do it on time. When you get comfortable, try more complex rhythm or a finger picking pattern. Here is an example of the F scale with jazz chords:  Fmaj7
Gm7
Am7
Bbmaj7
C7
Dm7
Ehalfdim
Fmaj7 Here are the fingerings, I've scanned my papers for you, so please do not mind the quality of an image :)  When chords are down, try improvising with them - just mix the chords from a scale in a way you feel is right. It's lots of fun and that's what jazz is all about :) Good luck in your playing!"
How does a pipe organist deal with latency or delay?,"Your suspicion that this is a learned skill is correct -- and this even applies when performing as a soloist! The organist must learn to disregard the timing information coming to their ears, and execute playing technique all relative to what their internalized musical image (and fingers and feet) are telling them. Also consider that (especially with antique organs), there may be quite a lot of places where latency is introduced even before the sound is actually produced. Mechanical linkages, pneumatics, all the size of a building instead of the size of a desk, like the mechanics of a piano. Modern organs do away with much of this through the use of digital technology and electric linkages where they can, but of course the speed of sound is still more or less significant depending on the size of the room. When performing in an ensemble, problems are solved in rehearsal and by the organist's familiarity with the instrument, room, and conductor. Generally the organ pipes and choir are situated at the same end of the room, so as long as the organ and choir are playing in time, the music will be correct for all of the listeners. This may be accomplished by the conductor simply following the timing of the organ accompaniment, rather than the organist following the conductor in some cases; in others the organist may have to ""guess"" where to place the next note based on what happened in rehearsal. I have never heard of an acoustic organist using a monitoring system -- keep in mind this would probably require a full organ synthesizer be involved to actually generate the monitored sound if it were happening synchronously with the keys and asynchronously from the pipes. And any pickup-based monitoring would either be late, coming from a centrally-located room mic, or completely impractical due to the sheer number of close-mic pickups you would need to effectively monitor an instrument consisting of up to tens of thousands of pipes. The iPad item is kind of a different question, but I would consider this kind of latency to be unacceptable in digital audio for most applications. Professional audio iPad (and other computer) applications should not have noticeable latency."
How can I tell when music is live and not recorded?,"I know exactly what you mean and I've thought about it quite hard myself. Not everyone can do this, but as you attune to music more and get used to what a drum kit or guitar playing in a room sounds like, it's easier to pick out the characteristics of live vs. recorded. I think it's a mixture of things:  The mix- sometimes live music isn't mixed as well as recorded music (e.g. the vocals are too loud/quiet or drums are loud etc). There's seemingly a tendency for guitars to be set more harshly with live music than when recorded. Reverb: If the band are playing live in say the corner of a pub, all of the instruments will bounce around the room and get much the same reverberaton treatment. In recorded music, different reverb is often artificially applied to vocals vs. guitars / drums etc. The snare drum especially : You're most likely hearing a snare drum which has echoed around the room before it gets to your ears. In a lot of recorded music, the snare microphone is pretty close to the snare (a few inches) plus some other mikes overhead which are still much closer than the audience would be to the kit. So recorded music tends to have a close-up sound on the snare whereas live music the snare is much more a part of the rest of what's happening. I personally find this a real giveaway. Vocalists wooping the crowd up between songs (a dead giveaway haha) or little twiddles between songs.  If you're listening to a live album, it still comes across this way because often the reverb from the stadium/hall/room where it was recorded is part of the recording, so the effect is retained. Having said that, it's possible to be fooled in that ""Alive"" by Pearl Jam is a live recording but has had a studio treatment afterwards. Our ears are amazing at picking up signals like this and seemingly we're able to determine live from recorded music quite easily, once we get used to it or train the ear."
How to play chords like G/B,"You've pretty much got it figured out.  If you read G/B as ""G over B"" it makes sense that your lowest note needs to be a B. There is nothing that says what string the B has to be played on, only that the G chord has to be above B. So, you can voice the chord up and down the neck, and keep the lowest note a B.  When this is really important is when there's a moving line in the harmony and is a B at that point.  When arranging for a group I'd often let a guitar ignore that voicing if I had other instruments that were moving the harmony line already. It just depends on how strong that note/harmony needs to be in the overall sound of the band. And, for the theory of it, it's really a G chord in first inversion."
Is there any way for my to become a better judge of my playing? Especially while I'm playing,"This is a terrific, and very important, question! Have you ever heard a recording of yourself speaking? Did it come across as odd to you? Did you ever think ""that's not how I sound!""? The same is often true when we play an instrument. In fact, playing an instrument is even more complex. In a kind of auditory McGurk Effect, our brain has to distinguish between how we think we are playing (or how we want to play) with how we are actually playing. In my experience, the best way to improve this is to continue checking your progress by recording yourself. For instance, you may think that you're playing a wide interval leap smoothly, but your recording proves otherwise. As such, you have to keep practicing and recording until it actually sounds smooth in the recording. Once you've mastered that smooth leap, then you can determine what that sounds like to you while you're playing, and map it onto future excerpts.  A teacher can also help with this; they can listen to you perform it, make adjustments to your technique, and eventually give you the ""Yes, remember that...that was it!"" response. Edit: And if you're not familiar with it, make sure to check out Arnold Jacob's (longtime Principal Tuba of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra) concept of ""song and wind."" Basically, he emphasizes ""song"" (how you want your music to come across to the audience) and ""wind"" (the airstream---very important for a flutist!) as the key elements to making effective music on a wind instrument."
What are Head voice and Chest voice,"Head voice, chest voice, throat voice, as well as their ""register"" version and falsetto are old and confusing names to describe an almost universal phenomena: When singing from the lowest to the highest pitch than you can sing, the hollow parts of our body  (chest, larynx, mouth, upper cranium) share and sustain differently the resonance of the sounds generated by the vocal chords.  One can feel these differences when singing but also when hearing them, because they give a different ""colour"" to the voice, because they amplify or diminish parts of the overtones of the voice. Starting from the Middle Ages, it has been conventional to identify the successive most common ways of singing from low to high notes : chest , throat, head voices  by analogy with a vertical scale of pitch, but physiological research shows that this is misleading. These resonances can also hinder or ease the production of certain notes, and we can act upon them by muscular control of all the organs involved (control of the abdominal muscles, of the ribs, of the throat, especially the larynx, position of the jaw, etc.) You can use these differences and this knowledge to emit more pleasant notes and extend your range. Most people naturally speak with a given type of emission, that is the most natural to them. With training they can speak comfortably in different modes and switch from one to the other. You may surprise yourself for instance to be able to speak high notes one moment and not be able to do it again when you have sung a few lower notes in between, because you cannot recreate consciously the conditions for those high notes. A large part of the classical ""bel canto"" technique consist in controlling this in a conventional way toward a few goals (essentially masking boundaries between resonance modes, choosing the best pitches to make the transition) and to reproduce classical voice models corresponding to typical opera role. I feel it is easier to learn about this by having lessons with a teacher who has already mastered this and can concretely help you to discover it and use it."
Am I allowed to add a b9 to a maj7 chord in Jazz?,"Adding a b9 to a major 7th chord creates a very dissonant sound because the chord has two different notes that are each a half step away from the root. The resolution would be tricky because the b9 would want to go down a half step and the 7th, and the root also needs to go somewhere.  That being said, however, I found a few voicing that sounds good for it, though, and it seems it would work well as a non-functional passing tone. As Sir Duck would say : If it sounds good, it is good. So as long as it fits wherever you put it, it should be fine. When playing around with the concept, I found going from a C9, then letting the D go down to a Db, then going to a Fsus4 finally resolving to an F. Not the prettiest sounding progression ever, but I like it.   As for voicings, inverting the chord does not work. I did not find a voicing outside of root position that would work. Spacing out the root, 7th, and b9 really help pad the dissonance. Omitting the 5th also helps. The voicing I liked best is below and has all the notes. "
"What are the greek modes, and how do they differ from modern modes?","I am really not knowledgable in ancient music theory so the following might be riddled with errors, but here is what I've gathered. What are the original Greek modes? Ancient Greek music scale theory was built upon the concept of the ""tetrachord"" - literally meaning four strings. A tetrachord consists of a group of four notes with three smaller intervals that together span the total interval of a perfect fourth (a 4:3 frequency proportion). The fourth was viewed as the basic unit for tuning, perhaps comparable to the octave of modern western music. In short there were three tuning genera or tonoi for a tetrachord, signified by the greatest appearing interval. (Example notes are in descending order as is apparently historically correct.) Diatonic (a-g-f-e)
{Greatest interval: approximately a whole tone} Chromatic (a-f#-f-e)
{Greatest interval: approximately a minor third} Enharmonic (a-f-fd-e) [fd denotes the quarter tone below f]
{Greatest interval: approximately a major third} The three internal intervals of a genus could be arranged in different permutations.
These tetrachord permutations or harmoniai were: The dorian group (a-g-f-e) The phrygian group (a-g-f#-e) The lydian group (a-g#-f#-e) Tetrachords were stacked to form greater systems of intervals. For instance, if you stack two diatonic lydian tetrachords on top of each other with a whole tone in between, you end up with what we today refer to as the diatonic major scale: e-d#-c#-b+a-g#-f#-e. The whole tone distance [9:8 frequency proportion] between the tetrachords is natural since it is the difference between a perfect fourth and a perfect fifth. Also, having two tetrachords of perfect fourths with a whole tone in between means that you end up with a perfect octave. One important system of stacked tetrachords was the ""Greater Perfect System"". It can be constructed using diatonic dorian tetrachords thus: Stack two of them (e-d-c-b and a-g-f-e) with a whole tone in between. Extend this system at each end by adding two conjunct tetrachords each sharing one note with the existing tetrachords. Finally add a whole tone to the bottom of the system in order to end up with a complete two octave span: Starting from different places in the Greater Perfect System gives the seven different harmoniai, or ancient greek modes, as follows (with example note names to illustrate the distribution of intervals - semitone intervals in bold): Dorian (e-d-c-b-a-g-f-e) Phrygian (d-c-b-a-g-f-e-d) Lydian (c-b-a-g-f-e-d-c) Mixolydian (b-a-g-f-e-d-c-b) Hypodorian (a-g-f-e-d-c-b-a) Hypophrygian (g-f-e-d-c-b-a-g) Hypolydian (f-e-d-c-b-a-g-f) Although the names of the modern church modes are drawn from the nomenclature of the ancient Greek modes, their uses don't match up. A german wikipedia article speaks of a translation error regarding this. And the english version has this text ""The Greek concepts of scales (including the names) found its way into
later Roman music and then the European Middle Ages to the extent that
one can find references to, for example, a ""Lydian church mode"",
although [the] name is simply a historical reference with no
relationship to the original Greek sound or ethos."" [Emphasis is mine] And another site says that mediaeval European music scholars misinterpreted the Latin works of Boethius, causing the shift of what mode is refered by what name. How do the slightly sharp/flat notes translate to playing a mode today? The Pythagorean Philolaus defined the interval ratios of the diatonic dorian tetrachord as 9:8, 9:8, and 256:243. This is the basis for what is refered to as the Pythagorean diatonic scale. Another Pythagorean, Archytas, defined interval divisions for all three tetrachord genera as: the enharmonic 5:4, 36:35, and 28:27 the chromatic 32:27, 243:224, and 28:27 the diatonic 9:8, 8:7, and 28:27 More on Pythagorean tunings of tetrachords is found here. The following table compares the tunings of Philolaus (Pythagorean diatonic) and Archytas to the modern equal tempered tuning (12-TET).  How would you notate greek modes now including microtonal pitch differences? Regarding notation of microtonal shifts from a base system, besides the use of a backwards flat sign (b) and a half sharp/hash sign (#) to denote quarter notes, I have seen various signs including plus signs and arrows to denote microtonal shifts from a base system. But how to represent the differences according to the table above is for someone more well-versed in the area to elaborate on.
My guess, though, would be that, if the whole composition is to be performed using a specific tuning, you simply state that in the liner notes and then use regular modern notation. The following are some of my sources: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_system_of_ancient_Greece

How should I tune a guitar with a Floyd Rose tremolo?,"Loosen the lock screws at the nut.  Adjust the fine tuners (on the bridge) to the ""middle"" position, so you'll have room to fine-tune in either direction. Ideally, tune one string at a time, with a tuner - trying to get the strings in tune with each other will be tough until everything's almost done, as tightening one string moves the bridge and throws the others out of whack.  After several passes over all 6 strings, things should stabilize.  Get things as close as possible before locking down, as the fine tuners have limited range. Lock the screws at the nut, and (again with a tuner) use the fine-tuners to finish the job."
Why don't organs have weighted keys?,"The main point of weighted keys are that they give more feel for the dynamic response of a piano-like instrument. Specifically, weighted keys make it so that gentle playing only results in gentle velo, i.e. low dynamic level. To play forte on a weighted keyboard, you literally need to put in some force, and that makes sense for the performance. With an unweighted keyboard, the force-dynamic relationship is much harder to control. But: an organ doesn't have dynamics (or rather, the dynamic level isn't controlled by key velocity but by registration, volume pedal etc.), so it's moot. However, pipe organs do have their own kind of “weight” on the keys, namely the pressure needed to overcome the valve resistance. This is quite different to weighted piano action though. See guest's answer for details."
"Etymology of word ""Octave""","It's because in music, when you're talking about intervals, you count the first note, all notes in between, as well as the final note. For example, if you play two notes that are right next to each other, the interval is a second - even though the second note is just ""one note"" away from the first. In fact, if you play the same note at the same time, it's called a prime, even though there's no distance between those two notes. A third is only two whole notes apart, a fourth only three, and so on. And the same way, an octave is only seven whole notes apart."
"What do musicians mean when they say ""learn music, not instruments""?","You can get tied up with the mechanics of playing an instrument. And, of course, the aim is to produce music. But I don't see the point in saying that sort of thing to a 2-month student.    Until the mechanics become second nature it's pretty impossible to be artistic!"
Piano notation for student unable to access written and spoken language,"This might be more like a comment, or it may answer the actual question behind what you literally wrote. You decide. You seem to assume a musical scenario with (1) a composition, (2) a performer, (3) an audience. Would it be possible to ditch that whole preconception and think about music in other ways? Why does there have to be notation? What is the thing that is supposed to be communicated using notation? Is that really the only way? Is that really the only possible purpose and goal? Music can be interaction. Music can be playing like a game or child's play with toys. Music can be a conversation. Music can be social. Music can be made in a group. Music can be made on the spot, improvised. Let's sing together, play together, make sounds together. Pitches, melodies, rhythms, harmonies, words, impressions. Real music. Have you ever participated in music-making any other way than ""some mastermind above me tells me what to do, and then I execute the given instructions?"" Have you ever said anything of your own to another person musically? Have you had a musical conversation? Musical game? Musical fun and messing around? Have you tried to add something to existing music? Repeat what you hear? Repeat what you hear, but with some deliberate variations? Surprise someone musically? Annoy someone? Make someone laugh? Make yourself laugh? Cry? Dance!? Sorry for ranting, but I have heard that children these days don't know how to play anymore. They don't take everyday objects and imagine them to be something else, see how other kids react and let their imagination flow freely. They're so used to pre-programmed stories and rules, everything has to be a predefined and pre-imagined detailed product made for that exact playing situation. A similar development has happened with music for a long time already. You don't just take an instrument and start, well, playing. Music has to be legitimate and proper, officially recognized pieces and genres. If you make a sound, you need to make sure that it's a socially acceptable, respectable sound! Or at least one that gets you upvotes and Likes. obTopic / Re: notation In the Suzuki method, at least at first, no notation is used. I haven't been there, but I've heard from friends and relatives that for a small child they might use a postcard or other picture as ""notation"" that's used (IIRC) simply to have something to look at, to assist remembering, if needed. There's a thing called figurenotes, which ""uses color and shape to show pitch and rhythm"".


 I'm personally not a huge fan of the goal centered on producing something that's correct. In that thinking, success means being able to correctly obey given instructions, and thus gain social acceptance. But I suppose it can be very helpful for disabled people, who often (so I've heard) suffer from anxiety caused by not being able to follow what's happening around them, in the ""normal"" people's world."
What are the problems in teaching guitar via Skype?,"Advantages are things like: You can teach people around the world, from all countries as long as they speak your language. You save time... Neither you nor your student have to drive around with all the instruments to get to each other. Additionally, if someone cancels the session, you could just put someone else in between without any troubles. If you allow the student to record the session, he can watch it over and over again in case he missed anything or just want to see it again. Some disadvantages: There is always the possibility of internet connection problems or trouble with your PC in general. It would be sad if they take their time and you can't start the lesson because of technical issues. There may also be lag or delay-issues with some software and it's a stupid feeling to start talking and after 2 seconds the voices are overlapping, because the other person actually wasn't finished or started to speak again :P You're just not able to show all the things via Skype that you could do in person. You can't correct his finger position, you can only show him how your fingers are. But if he just doesn't get it, it would be great to be able to touch his hand and position the fingers the correct way. You also can't demonstrate things like how much pressure they should apply to the strings... I mean, how would you tell somebody over Skype how hard they should press a string? :/ In general, it's just always better to meet someone in person rather than seeing him virtually on a PC. The sound quality is of course way better in real life and I think with instruments this is really important... Let the student have a bad microphone, or you not the best speakers. I wouldn't want to teach a student how to play an instrument when the guitar sounds like a crying cat on your side of the line. You can't hand out any sheet music to the student or similar and if you want to discuss something, you can't just point at the position and say there... you would have to say in bar X, the Xth beat etc. It's probably harder to follow on a video where your fingers actually are on the guitar. It's so much easier when the student is right in front of you or can look you over the shoulder. It's unusual but still possible you might want to trade guitars with the student, either to help them tune or fix something on their guitar, or so they can feel/hear/experience something with your guitar that is different from theirs, and of course you can't do this over Skype. ..."
Are very cheap cellos acceptable for a beginner?,"I'm going to suggest an alternative route.  Get him an electric cello. The weak point in cheap instruments is the acoustics, and to meet the price point they have to be constructed in a more rough-and-ready manner.  As soon as you go electric, you don't need those acoustics.  Production is much more straightforward, and there are simply fewer variables with an electric instrument. $100 electric guitars are usually absolutely fine for a beginner.  A while ago now, I bought an electric violin for £50, new.  That included violin, case, bow and rosin.  The bow was a POS, but the violin was and is perfectly OK - it even sounds acceptable acoustically for quiet practise.  (Another bonus for you: it's quieter when he's still making noises like a creaky door!)  Cheap instruments generally need a setup, so you should probably expect to have to file the bridge shape on the cello to make the action better, but that's about it. Where you must invest is in the bow.  Whatever the instrument is, buy the bow separately, and expect to spend around $50 for something halfway acceptable.  Much more of the playability of a bowed instrument is in the bow than the instrument.  Even if you decide to go down the rental route in the end, the bow should be his."
What is the difference between increasing volume and increasing gain?,"'Gain' just means 'amount of amplification'.  It can be applied at various stages in the signal chain between musical source and final playback. The topic we're talking about is called 'Gain staging'.  It basically means that at EVERY point where amplification takes place we should strive to keep the signal above the noise floor but below the overload level.  In the old days of analogue recording (and noisy preamps/mixers) we erred on the high side.  Noise floors were high, moderate overload didn't hurt much - sometimes we even LIKED the effect and called it 'valve sound' or 'tape saturation'.   Now we tend to keep levels safely 'under the ceiling'.  Noise floors on today's equipment, even the cheaper stuff, are pretty low but hitting the digital ceiling just sounds nasty. Perhaps your question is about the 'gain' knob at the top of a channel strip on a mixer?  Setting this low but amplifing later would normally mean MORE noise.  Unless, perhaps, you were setting it TOO high and causing overload distortion at that stage.  Although the overall volume can subsequently be modified, the distortion will still be there. There's also the special case of guitar amps, where a 'gain' control may be used to deliberately push the signal into overload, causing an interesting-sounding type of distortion.  In this case you have the choice of setting 'gain' low for a clean sound, higher for a distorted one.  The main volume control comes later.  But you say this question is about a mic input. The old Mackie mixer manuals were very informative. Read 'Set the levels' on page 5 here.  It may not be directly applicable to your setup, but the principle applies. https://mackie.com/sites/default/files/PRODUCT%20RESOURCES/MANUALS/Owners_Manuals/1604VLZ4_OM.pdf"
Why do many acoustic pianos have a wooden block to the left of the keys?,"As @BobBroadley says, the Key Block holds the keyboard in place. However, why is the key block needed in the first place? Presumably the left side of the case could do the same job. Key blocks have been a part of pianos since their invention. The article Who invented the piano – and why does nobody remember him? includes a (copyright controlled) image of a Cristofori piano, clearly showing key blocks at either end. The why is that room for the piano's frame is needed between the action and the case. Pianos are not mounted directly on the case, rather the frame rests inside. Upright / Vertical In addition to leaving room for the frame, extra room is needed on modern pianos to account for the diagonal placement of the strings. The strings in the piano are set at an angle, which allows for greater string length without lengthening the entire instrument. Because of this, there's extra space at the end of the piano. Here's an interior view of a typical upright piano (an Essex). Notice how the bass strings extend past the left edge of the keyboard.  In fact, one can see that the action itself is angled to the left., and there is also room for the frame and some of the pedal mechanism. Thus, the key block is a necessity.  Grand pianos The situation on a grand piano is the same. First, there needs to be room for the plate (frame) between the case and the action. In addition, due to the angled strings and the hammer strike point (shown in the picture below), there needs to be some extra room for the strings to meet the pin block.  (and, yes, putting a teacup there is a terrible idea. )"
"How can horns, most of which have only three buttons, play all their notes?","Put as simply as possible, horns are tubes. Blowing in special ways makes certain notes sound from those tubes. By changing one's embouchure, those notes start at a fundamental, then gradually go up in harmonics. The first notes (in key C) would be C, G, C, E, G.Those notes are the ones we hear when a bugle is played - Reveille, Last Post, etc. Bugles only play the harmonic series of notes, and can't play the ones in between. Read on. On a trumpet, for starters, there are three valves. One drops any open note played by one semitone, another by two semitones, and the other by three semitones. So using a combination of valves, you can lower any open note by up to six semitones. Let's take the first G note. To get F♯, press the semitone valve. To get F, press the tone valve. To get E, press two valves to drop a tone and a half. (there's one valve alone that can do this). To play E♭, press the two valves that drop two tones. To get D, press the two valves to drop two and a half tones. And to get C♯, press all three. That's the more complicated bit, as between the open notes, there's more semitones than anywhere else further up in pitch. Notice that between G and the next C, there are only two tones. So at this point, not so many notes are needed, so the valve pressing is more simple. Next, between that C and the E, there's even fewer, so again, not so many valve changes are needed. Now, onto trombone. There are actually valve trombones, which work the same as trumpets, etc., but for the standard trombone, imagine those extra lengths of tube brought into play by pressing valves are now a single continuum of tubing, operated by the slide. At various places along that slide, there are all the notes found similarly to pressing valves. There's also loads of extra notes that are going to be out of tune!"
"Is it true that cut time means ""play twice as fast as written""?","It would be more accurate to say that cut time ""will sound twice as fast as the same notes played in 4/4 at the same tempo"".  That's essentially what they're trying to get across. But even that wouldn't really be accurate.  Cut time is a duple meter, 4/4 is a quadruple meter.  The difference is subtle, but it's still a difference."
What is a secondary dominant chord?,"In common-practice theory, secondary dominant chords are chromatic harmonies used to approach a non-tonic chord with greater urgency. Let's use C major for examples: I might want to approach the V chord (G) with a secondary dominant to give greater direction or ""color"" to the approach. I construct the secondary dominant by going to the V chord of the V chord. In other words, I briefly pretend I'm in G Major, and borrow its V, which is a D major chord. The standard Roman numeral notation is V/V, and the chord is chromatic to the original key of C major due to the third (F#). Just as often, I might borrow the V7 from the target chord's key, and this would be labeled V7/V and would be a D dominant 7th chord. Generally only major or minor non-tonic diatonic chords are used as targets, but obviously one could extend this to other qualities and to chromatic chords. In some cases, particularly V/IV, the secondary dominant would not be chromatic. In C major, the target chord IV would be F Major, and its key's dominant would be C major, which isn't chromatic to the original key. In such cases, composers will almost always use the V7/IV instead, which in C major would have the chromatic note Bb. The concept is easily extended to vii° chords, since they also have dominant function. In C major vii°/V would be F#dim for example. Most theorists distinguish between the two by calling secondary vii° chords secondary leading tone chords instead of secondary dominants, but the concept is precisely the same. In all cases, their purpose is to highlight the target chord, and create a sharper resolution to it."
Do ear plugs have a big effect on ability to hear the music?,"I write from personal experience -- I now always wear earplugs as an audience member in big gigs. When music is very loud, it impairs your ability to hear detail. Pitch and even rhythm become difficult to discern. At a certain level of loudness, your brain ""fills in"" the detail. This is why it's a good idea to play demo tapes loud to A&R men, but keep the monitors at a moderate level when mastering. If the music is loud enough, the brain reassembles bad singing into what it thinks it wants to hear - natural autotune. However that's not good news for the musician -- what sounds good the guitarist standing next to his up-to-eleven amp, might sound horrible to someone further away -- or on the recording. At levels a bit louder than that, or with sustained exposure to loud music, the brain can get completely overwhelmed, and fail to discern much except the basic pulse of the rhythm. I have experienced this many times -- the music is so loud that I can't discern individual instruments; I can't understand lyrics; I can't spot a tune. Putting my fingers in my ears fixes everything. Go even louder, and even the rhythm can become garbled. It should be noted that even if the music isn't so loud as to distort in the ear/brain, it may still be causing permanent damage to your hearing. Earplugs are the solution. Wearing earplugs when the music is loud should let you hear more detail, not less. The cheapest earplugs are disposable foam ones designed as a sleep aid, or for ear protection in noisy environments like factories. They do the job OK, but they are designed for safety, not for music fidelity. They do not block frequencies evenly, tending to let more bass through than mid and treble. Earplugs designed for music tend not to be disposable. They are described as being for music on their packaging, and are designed to attenuate frequencies evenly. If you find them uncomfortable, it may be worth spending extra for a pair custom made for your ears. There are a couple of issues with earplugs, related to the fact that they don't block your own voice: It may be possible to get stage levels quiet enough that you don't need plugs. If you're a drummer on an acoustic kit, you're going to need ear protection. Otherwise, the stage doesn't have to be as loud as the auditorium. "
How is it that 12 eighth notes fit in a measure labeled as common time?,"They are actually eighth note triplets instead of eighth notes. The alternative notation to this would be to group the eighth notes and rests in threes and put a 3 over them like a standard triplet, but it's easy enough to see that you are fitting 12 equally spaced notes in a measure which end up being eighth note triplets which would kind of screw up the legato flow of the passage. Another thing to note is it is very common if you expect to be playing in 4/4 with almost exclusively triplets you would play in 12/8 so you don't have to put triplets over each set of three eighth notes they would just work out to 12 eighth notes a  measure.  This piece takes this idea , but just keeps the piece in 4/4 and it is just implied that the eighth notes are triplets."
How can I reduce the echo/reverb in a large room if I can't add physical damping?,"Noise cancellation never works on scales larger than the sound's wavelength, so it's only useful for headphones. Modifying the hall physically is the only real solution to this problem. Short of that, the first thing to try is indeed to bring the sound as directly to the audience as possible, by using a suitable PA arrangement. Big, single speakers located ""out of sight"" are generally worse than multiple speakers close to the audience, either at different levels (delay lines) or as a stack (approximate line array, which partially cancels the sound that goes to the ceiling). If that's not enough, the only thing you can do is modify the sound signals itself. Obviously, a small acoustic ensemble will have less of a problem with reverb than a large, loud rock band. In particular, uncompressed drum accents cause reverb throughout the frequency spectrum that often overpowers everything else. So you want to make the drums themselves as quiet as possible. The monitor levels should also be kept down, because those signals arrive at the audience only indirectly.
Then, on the PA, you should aim at a strongly frequency-separated mix and rather agressive compression. This way, all instruments should come through reasonably well even when the time-domain is completely smeared out by the reverb."
Is G sharp major a real key?,"I'm not sure why you'd have any reason to question why it's real ... it's not really related to G Major though, no more than C# major is related to C Major.  It's enharmonically equivalent to A♭ major, just like C# Major = D♭ Major or F# Major = G♭ Major. As for pieces involving it, Wikipedia mentions some.  In general, keys with double-sharps aren't used very commonly because their equivalents are easier to play.  With just intonation, however, G# is not actually the same note as A♭, nor are the keys the same.  For more information on that see my answer here and the answers on the question it links to."
Why is 'additive' EQ more difficult to use than 'subtractive'?,"There are many differences between boosting and cutting with EQ. I'll discuss the ones that stand out to me the most: One way to think about a mix is that it's like packing a box, or perhaps like playing Tetris. You're trying to get all these things to both fit together and also fit into a limited space. With a mix, you've got your dynamic range and your frequency response and that kinda makes a box that everything has to fit into. For many mixes, you not only want to make sure everything fits in the box, you also want the box to be mostly full, or at least not mostly empty, and you want some of the things in the box to be bigger or smaller or a certain shape. Like Tetris, you are usually given certain shapes to work with and you have to figure out how to make them fit. Sometimes you can get some control over what you're given to mix, but not always. To me, EQ is like a way to change the shapes that you're given while you're packing them into the mix. So that's pretty cool! Imagine being able to do that in Tetris! To abuse the Tetris analogy, cutting EQ might be like taking little squares off of a Tetris shape, while boosting is like adding little squares. Hopefully that analogy alone starts you thinking about why boosting can be trickier. When you boost, you're giving yourself more stuff to try to fit into the same total space, while cutting actually makes it a bit easier to fit it all in. Now you can't just cut for free without consequences. First off, you usually don't want the shapes you were given to be completely carved away to nothing, and you also want to have the box more or less full when you're done, but judicious cutting more often makes things easier and not harder. Reckless boosting can make the mix a lot harder. Another aspect of cutting that is easier is that if you cut something bad, then there's less bad in the mix, and maybe you cut little bit of something good accidentally at the same time, but it's not too hard to tweak the EQ to retain as much of the good as possible when you're cutting. But when you boost, you can be adding both good and bad, and tweaking a boost to only boost the good and not the bad is harder. The bad stuff brought out by an EQ boost sticks out like a sore thumb. The good stuff cut away by an EQ cut many times won't be missed. Cuts also depend less on what you're given. When you cut, you're throwing away something you don't want. If what you're cutting wasn't there in the first place, then it doesn't hurt anything to cut it anyway. Boosts don't work at all if there's nothing there to boost. EQ cannot create frequencies, it can only multiply them. 1000 times 0 is still 0. So if you have a recording of a soprano singer and you try to boost something like 50 Hz, you're just going to be adding noise. That's an extreme and ridiculous example, but many engineers don't realize when they don't actually have the frequencies they are trying to boost. So when boosting, you have to be carefully listening and hearing what you've got and how you're changing it. There are a lot of cuts you can make blind (or maybe I should say ""deaf""), like you can high pass 80 Hz and up on most tracks without even thinking about it and not mess up a mix. That brings up another difference: If you cut the same frequencies on several tracks, they are basically all getting out of each other's way. But if you boost the same frequency on several tracks, they will start to fight each other. So you have to remember or keep track of your boosts and make sure you don't overlap too many of them. Cuts you can make and then forget about without having to figure out in the future why the 1000 - 1200 Hz range sounds so busy (for example). Finally, I want to pass along some advice I read online many years ago: Use cuts to make a track sound better, use boosts to make it sound different. Thinking about that advice, it also show why cuts are easier. Taking away the bad is pretty straightforward, because you know what you're trying to take away before you take it away. It's like opening a fridge and getting rid of only the bad cheese: just look for the moldy ones and throw them away. Now imagine the same fridge filled with 30 unlabeled cheeses and you're not sure which one will go best with the bottle of wine you just opened and you can see why boosting is harder: You have to find the best boost(s) through trial and error. You basically have to taste a little of every cheese before you know, unless you have a lot of experience with all kinds of cheeses. If you're boosting to make it sound different, it's not alway obvious which differences will sound better and which will sound worse. Hopefully that gives you some ideas about why it's different to boost versus cut. I could type a lot more if I had the time. But instead of my typing and you reading, we should both be mixing/producing. The more you work with EQ, the more these things will become apparent to you. The hard truth about mixing is that you can't really learn more than 5% of it by reading the web. You have to go do it. I've started to think there's an aspect of this question that hasn't been fully addressed yet: So, isn't it just the shape of the EQ curve that matters? It seems to me that whether more or less of it is above or below the 0dB line shouldn't matter, because I'm going to adjust the overall track volume anyway, to achieve the mix that I want. Thinking about the quote above, I think what's going on here is maybe you're conflating the science of how EQ and filters work with the art of mixing. For starters, the EQ curve that you create with your EQ settings is not determining the time-average power levels of the frequencies the track. All that EQ does is change the time-average power levels of the frequencies the track. The raw recording has the most impact on the final time-average power levels, and almost every other process you might do on a track (plugin or effect) also changes the time-average power levels of the frequencies of the track. So the final result of what you get in the mix for a track is like 80% - 90% based on the recorded sound, maybe 5% - 8% based on the EQ settings, and then the rest is the smaller effects of compression, modulation effects (chorus, flange, phase, etc.) and so on. So EQ is a really small part of your mix, and the sound of the track itself is much more powerful than the EQ of the track in terms of what it does to a mix. Going back to the line drawn by the EQ settings, you have to overlay that line on top of the power spectrum of the track and then you can get a slight idea of how the track is contributing different frequencies to the mix. Like if you cut or boost everything below 150 Hz on a track of a soprano vocalist, well you just did almost nothing to the sound of the mix because there wasn't anything there to cut or boost! And you would be surprised at how many frequency ranges in most tracks pretty much cannot be boosted because there's just nothing there. Depending on how it's tuned and played and miked, you can have a kick drum track where boosting 900 Hz by 18 dB does pretty much nothing but add noise. And that's just one obvious example. The other thing I want to address is don't mix with your eyes, don't mix with a calculator or with science, mix with your ears. The line on the EQ curve can't tell you whether a track is going to sit right, only your ears can do that. Ears are much more sensitive and effective and discerning than any meter, analyzer, or other device or scientific data. Boosting is harder than cutting because of the way the sound of the mix changes when you boost versus when you cut. It has nothing to do with overall gain of the track or anything besides that. Not only is it not just the shape of the EQ curve that matters, the shape of the EQ curve doesn't matter at all! I can't emphasize that enough but I don't want to go all caps. The shape of the EQ curve is immaterial. The only things that matter are how the track sounds and how the mix sounds, and the shape of the EQ cannot tell you either of those things. Let me go back to Tetris one more time to address the part about EQ versus overall gain. EQ is like adding or removing little squares from a Tetris shape. Overall gain is like making the whole shape bigger or smaller. So which is easier to deal with in Tetris, a really huge square (all squares but one were taken away with subtractive EQ and then overall gain was boosted a lot), or a small crazy shape with little squares and lines sticking out all over (a bunch of different boosts adding squares to the original shape in random places and then the gain brought down a lot)? Subtractive EQ makes tracks easier to mix because it makes them into ""smaller, simpler shapes"". Then you can scale those simple shapes up and down to make them the right size and they are easy to pack together. Additive EQ makes larger, more complicated shapes. Shrinking the whole thing down after boosting some frequencies doesn't make the shape any better, just smaller. And if you boost enough and then drop the gain to make it fit in the mix, you just end up with something that sounds terrible and quiet, when what we want is good and loud. Even though I already put in at least 1,000 words, I thought a picture might help:  Notice how when EQ is boosted, it can be harder to get the EQ right, and the consequences of getting it wrong are worse for the mix than getting it wrong with cutting. Yes, I know that the shape scaling isn't exactly ""fair"", but the way actual audio works is more like this."
Is it good practice to use Synthesia to figure out songs?,"It isn’t bad practice. However you win your war you win.
Whether it is the best idea or not in the long term depends on your goals. 
Just like learning guitar music with tabs rather than traditional notation there are advantages and disadvantages.  Some obvious advantages include: You don’t have to learn standard notation now You get to hear the song while you go along What ever other reasons you can think of for why you do it now.  The disadvantages are numerous.  you can only learn pieces that somebody bothers to prepare for YouTube. While you think just about any song is there I am willing to bet that that’s not true. Also there would probably be only one or two arrangements of the song. you aren’t necessarily exposing yourself to technique building exercises. You might be but assuming you rely on this format only I doubt you’ll be doing many scales and études You’ll be limited in what you can play with other musicians or even strangers. By learning standard notation and conventional methods for you chosen genre and instrument you develop the ability to get started with others with relative ease. Guitar players generally know how to follow a song by ear. Jazz players generally know how to follow a lead sheet etc.  Time - the biggest most significant disadvantage. Using any non written prerecorded format for learning music severely slows you down. If you miss something you have to manually use whatever interface to seek the point you missed. And repeating sections can only happen at the pace of the playback. Jumping along to similar passages based on similarity is slow. When reading you can basically instantly get to any point you want. You can also get an ‘Aerial view’ that would allow you to spot patterns and such. If none of those advantages matter to you and you only want the easy way now so you can play a short piece for a talent show or something then you have the right tool in Synthesia.  Otherwise you really should put in the effort now and learn to at least kind of read written music. You’ll be better for it in the medium/long term.  As for the respect part... I don't know for sure but I am willing to bet ‘serious musicians’ would shake their heads in disapproval. That’s an obvious generalization but the music world is pretty well known for snobbery of all types. I recommend you don’t worry about that.  When you are performing a piece literally nobody in the audience cares how you learned it. They just care how you play it there and then.  Edit Apparently it just uses MIDI files. Which reduces the impact of the first disadvantage. However one must still be able to either find MIDI files or prepare them for themselves. If you're going to go through the effort of converting transcribed music to MIDI, you'll be at least learning the note names of standard notation."
Should one write ♯ or ♭?,"There are a few general rules. The reason for these enharmonics is the number of key signatures they are naturally found in. C# is found in 6 key signatures, while Db is only found in four. So, C# is the primary name for that enharmonic. D# is found in four, while Eb is found in 6. You can find a complete list here. However, if one accidental makes a passage a lot easier to read, prefer that one over the one specified in these rules. For example, E D# E would be preferred to E Eb E♮.  Basically, these are general guidelines and have plenty of exceptions. "
I don't understand the bottom number in a time signature,"To put it very simply, the bottom number tells you what the top number is referring to. It is a little clearer to use the fractional way of discussing notes, so: So a measure of 4/4 has four quarter notes (4 x 1/4) and a measure of 2/2 has two half notes (2 x 1/2). Technically, the measures both contain the same number of quarter notes, but the measures will be counted differently as ttw described. But the bottom number does not always equate to the beat. It just tells you what the top number is referring to. So you can have music in 5/4 with five quarter notes per measure and music in 5/8 with five eighth notes per measure, but these measures will each have a different number of beats - usually 5/4 will have five beats and 5/8 will have two beats of unequal length."
Relationship between 3/4 and 4/4,"Time signatures and bars are not there arbitrarily, nor just to help count your way through a piece. They are there to provide guidance on the rhythm of the piece. Where it is accented, where it breathes. Some composers do write pieces with no time signature or bars, as an indication that there should be no consistent rhythm. Eric Satie did this for several pieces. Let's try doing what you've suggested with a well known nursery rhyme, first in 4/4: You can see, this puts one line of verse in each bar. If you perform it with a strong accent on the first beat, and weak accent on the third beat of each bar, the accents fall where you'd expect them, if you were speaking the line normally: ""Half a pound of tup-enny rice."" Now what if we divide it into 3 beat bars instead: As you can see, it makes a nonsense of the verse. Try clapping a 3/4 oom-pah-pah rhythm and chanting the verse along to it. Or, going in the opposite direction, something that should be in 3/4: ... into 4/4 So, ""Here comes a can-dle to light you to bed"" becomes ""Here comes a can-dle to light you to bed."" Of course, not all music has lyrics that you can ""break"" in this way. But even instrumental music has rhythm, accents, breathing space and flow, which change if you put the bar lines in different places. It is possible to adapt a tune from one time signature to another while keeping the accented notes at the start of the bars - but this necessarily involves modifying the rhythm of the notes, for example, changing two half-notes into a single note. For example, listen to Bob Dylan's Highway 61 Revisited, which is in 4/4, then PJ Harvey's adaptation in 3/4 (or 12/8, depending on how you choose to count it)."
What made 4/4 time the most common time signature?,"Marches are generally in 4/4 (or 2/4 or 6/8, some binary division.) Likewise, most ballroom dances are in 4 (actually, dancers count to 8 but that's more technical that is called for here). Waltz and Viennese waltz are in 3/4 (maybe a few notated in 3/8 but not commonly.) Jigs (6/8 or 12/8) and tarantellas are not so common. Foxtrot, tango, rumba, mambo, bolero (American), quickstep, swing, western swing, cha-cha-cha, Texas two-step,  Lindy-hop, salsa, paso doble, jive, nightclub two-step, etc. are all generally notated in 4/4. Some were in the late 1800s and early 1900s notated in 2/4 with an eighth note as pulse.  For some reason (which I will now have to research to satisfy my own curiosity), the breve isn't fast and the longa is really long. Since the 1500s or so, it seems that the quarter note has been the basic pulse indicator. I don't know why yet.  In modern notation, the time signature just carries relative rhythmic information, not basic tempo. Thus older tangos (see Todotango.com) and older rags (Library of Congress) and the like were notated in 2/4. One can re-write them in 4/4 and double the note lengths with no change. I like 4/4 as it's a nice compromise between too many flagged notes and too many open notes. Perhaps that's just because most things I read are in 4/4."

If Für Elise is in Am why there is a D# in it?,"It is common to use notes that are not in the scale to add color. It's called chromaticism, from the ancient Greek word for color. Think how composers use a G# instead of a G in A minor, for example as a part of an E chord. A semitone creates more tension and the tendency of G# to resolve to (go to) A is more powerful. This is called a chromatic approach note. But since this particular usage is very common, we usually label it the ""harmonic minor scale"". Similarly, using an F# to avoid the melodically awkward (to western classical ears) augmented second between F and G# is also quite common. Then we label it as the ""melodic minor"" scale. These two so-called alterations are very common to warrant a new name. But there are many other possibilities. The D# here is a quite common example. It's a chromatic approach note to E. A few notes later Beethoven uses a D natural, notice how that strong tendency of resolving to E is now mostly gone. The reason it's labeled D#, instead of Eb is this. It's not a flattened fifth, it's a sharpened fourth. The fifth (E) is still there, this one is a degree lower, so it's a (sharpened) fourth. A flattened fifth (Eb) would replace the E and would tend to resolve to D, because just like the sharpened notes tend to resolve upwards, flattened notes tend to resolve downwards. Granted, it mostly concerns classical music. Blues is a different beast. The flattened fifth and sharpened fourth can be used interchangeably. The convention is still to notate them with a sharp for upward moving lines and with a flat for downward moving lines but it's not used consistently. That blue note, after all, does not even exist on a piano when properly played or sung. It's generally flatter than D#/Eb when sung or played on a fretless instrument or on an instrument that can do bends. It's an alien coming from a different musical culture, a square peg that we try to squeeze in to the round hole we have: The so-called equal temperament."
What was the motivation for the invention of electric pianos?,"A lot of instruments from the analog era were supposed to sound like other ""real"" instruments, and were as good as technology allowed then, which is not very. But over time, some have become popular in their own right.   Electric pianos were indeed supposed to sound like acoustic pianos (although some manufacturers saw the potential of adding features like tremolo). Hammond tonewheel organs were supposed to sound like pipe organs (and were marketed as a more convenient option for churches). The Mellotron was supposed to sound like a real choir or string section. The Roland TB-303 (which later became the sound of acid house) was supposed to sound like a bass guitar. The TR-808 and TR-909 (which later became the sound of hip hop and techno respectively) were supposed to sound like a real drummer. String synths such as the Solina String Ensemble were supposed to sound like a real string section.   None of these sounds very convincing compared to the real thing, or to more recent sample-based or modelling-based digital technology. But, as you say, they were cheaper, easier to record, easier to amplify, easier to carry around, and didn't require much tuning; so they were extensively used in popular music of the time, and are now considered ""classic"" sounds.

What is the difference between swing and shuffle?,"[I'm addressing 'swing time' and 'shuffle time', not 'swing style' and only indirectly bearing upon 'shuffle style'. Ulf raises a very useful distinction between these, I think.] Swing covers a broader range than shuffle, which is a sort of crystalized swing.  If you start with strict time, then squeeze the off-beats a little closer to the following beat you get swing. Duh. da-Duh. da-Duh. Like a heartbeat. If you squeeze further, the stretched beat and the squeezed beat approach the ratio of 2:1, so you can notate it with a quarter note and an eighth note. This is often notated at the top of the chart, eg. 2 eighth notes equals 1 quarter plus 1 eighth, then the music itself is written with straight eighth notes and you must add the swing to it. Shuffle is a special case where the swing time coexists with a straight time and a good drummer will keep changing the emphasis between the two. Often written 12/8, it is 4/4 time. It is also 3/8+3/8+3/8+3/8 tie. Bippity Boppity Bippity Boppity. I suppose the difference, in my opinion, boils down to: swing merely squeezes the off-beat closer to the following beat; shuffle does this and also adds the middle note, locking the triplet in place. A piece can swing harder, approaching a dotted eighth plus a sixteenth. Or a piece can lightly swing, perhaps like a dotted eighth plus a regular eighth. But you cannot shuffle any more or less; you're either doing it or you're doing something else."
A chord is three notes? What do you call just two notes?,"From my experience, there is no one 'best' term for two notes played together that is universally (or near-universally) agreed-on. dyad is the most specific term for a pair of pitches sounding together, but it's not commonly-used.  interval works for many, but others will say that is a term for the distance between the notes, rather than something that refers to the act of playing them together. some will say that chord is fine for two notes, and that seems to be the case for specific usages like the term 'power chord'. on stringed instruments one may talk about playing a double-stop, although that's a reference to the playing technique rather than the pure concept. So basically, whatever term someone uses, you have license to be a bore and tell them they're wrong. "
Why crescendo or decrescendo over one long note in piano music?,"There are several situations where this notation makes sense in piano music. Here are examples of the second and third ones, taken from a standard edition (Breitkopf & Härtel) of Chopin's complete works:  
 But there is also a lot of incompetent music engraving being done, and ""published"" on the web, by people who don't know actually much about music notation beyond how to use a computer notation program."
Tips for how to stay calm before a concert,"Firstly, realize that it's normal to be anxious before an important performance. Experienced performing musicians often still have some level of anxiety, and there are even stories of some big-name artists who still get nervous. That said, there are definitely some things you can do to lessen both the anxiety and its impact on your performance. Use the anxiety: One very common technique is to transform the anxiety into energy. You may think that energy and stage presence are the domain of rock musicians or opera singers, but even individual members of a large ensemble have to convey that energy to their audience. When you get a jolt of nerves, that's your brain dumping adrenaline into your bloodstream. Tell yourself that you're not nervous, you're excited or amped up. It's really the same thing, physiologically. The difference is your mental state. Take care of your health: Many amateur musicians, and some professionals, underestimate the impact of taking care of themselves on their performance and on their mental state. Make sure you're getting plenty of sleep (7.5 hours+ if you can manage it), drinking plenty of water (I easily drink a gallon and a half or more throughout the day), and getting a reasonable amount of exercise (I find cardio in particular useful, but it's up to you). If you're not taking care of yourself, the increased stress on your body will put increased stress on your mind. Prepare well: Obviously, if you're not properly prepared, you're not going to have a good performance, and this will make you much more anxious. Make sure you practice properly and for enough time, and make sure to take a little time before the performance to mentally prepare yourself (breathing exercises, meditation, a nap, or just laying back with a favorite beverage), and to warm up thoroughly (but don't be tempted to use the time for last-minute practice). Realize that live performances are often not perfect: Ask (nearly) any performing musician, and they'll tell you that they've made their fair share of mistakes during performances, often ones that they were very embarrassed about or that felt like stupid mistakes.  Studio recordings use the best bits and pieces from as many takes as is necessary, and are picked through and polished meticulously. Live music isn't so. No amount of preparation can keep you from being human or can make you perform above your skill level (practicing makes you better, but no amount of practice makes a first year violin student on par with a professional).  Do your best, learn from your mistakes, and seek to minimize them, but don't beat yourself up when you do screw up. As you get better, you'll begin to learn how to roll with mistakes and make them less noticeable, and to recover from them smoothly. The real secret of professionals isn't that they never make a mistake, but rather that they cover it up skillfully and recover quickly. Also remember that the vast majority of the time that you make a mistake, the audience doesn't notice. Most of the rest of the time, they don't care. If you don't acknowledge the mistake (for example, by grimacing), then that's not what they'll likely remember. I'll share with you the word-for-word advice that my choir director gave me before my first solo gig: ""The hard work is over with the writing and practicing and planning. Time to coast and enjoy! Write off the foibles. Live music isn't ever airbrushed--that why we love it!"" (Bonus) Get some ""help"": This is not advice that can, or should, be applied universally, but in the interest of creating an answer that's broadly applicable to the community, and in having a frank discussion about some of the techniques that musicians use, I'm including it here. There are a few techniques to relieve anxiety that involve ingesting certain substances. The three that come to mind are alcohol, herbal supplements (no, not that kind of herbal supplement), and prescription medicines. Alcohol: Some musicians find that a small amount of alcohol helps relax them. Others find that it throws them completely off. I'm not advocating underage or excessive drinking, and, in fact, it's incredibly important to be extremely familiar with how alcohol affects you, in general and musically, before you try this in a performance.  Herbal: The main herbal supplement that comes to mind is Kava root. It helps relieve anxiety in general, and can be useful to musicians. It does have side effects that could make it potentially dangerous for some people, so I'd advise working with a doctor. Prescription medicines: Some doctors are willing to prescribe beta-blockers to reduce nervousness for performing musicians. I've never tried them, but I know a performing musician who is also a medical doctor who swears by them. These have a strong potential for interactions and side effects, and should never be used except under the close supervision of a doctor.  "
"What does it mean for a sound to be ""dirty""?","Every sound is composed of one or more sine waves.  From that group of sine waves, the one with the lowest frequency is called the fundamental, every other sine wave above that one is called an overtone.  Overtones that are integer multiples of the fundamental are called harmonics. The fundamental is considered a harmonic, the first harmonic, but not an overtone. The characteristics of these overtones (like quantity, amplitude, and frequency) is what gives each sound a specific timbre. That's why a guitar and a piano sound different, even when playing the same note. It's all about the overtones. How many overtones. A sound with more overtones will tend to sound dirtier than one with less overtones. Frequency of the overtones and their relation with the fundamental. From two sounds with equal quantity of overtones, the one with less harmonics (less overtones that are integer multiples of the fundamental) will tend to be perceived as dirtier.  Loudness of the overtones. The loudest overtones will have a bigger influence in the timber of a sound than the quieter ones. So, it is about both quantity and quality.  These 3 are what I consider the most important dynamics that define the dirtiness of a sound. There's a more in-depth, scientific, concept called auditory roughness introduced by Helmholtz in 1885 which takes other things into consideration, like amplitude fluctuations of the spectrum and pitch instability. You can read more about it here, here,  and here.  (check your sound levels before playing these) This is how a sine wave sounds like:  https://soundcloud.com/jcpedroza/sine-wave-in-c-523-25hz This is how a square wave sounds like:  

 Both are at the same frequency (note): C 523.25Hz, but the square wave has much more overtones than the sine wave (the sine has no overtones and only one harmonic). Can you notice how the square wave is much more ""dirtier"" than the sine wave, which is much more ""cleaner""? Using software, we can ""see"" these overtones, and the waveform of the sound. This is the waveform of a sine wave:  And here is the overtone content of a sine wave.  Here we can clearly see that the sine wave has only one harmonic, the fundamental, and has no overtones. It's that peak at around 523Hz.  Now let's see the waveform of a square wave:   And the overtones of the square wave:   The square wave has many more overtones! It sounds ""dirtier"". We know that the frequency of the overtones and their relation to the fundamental can also carve how dirty a sound is perceived, it's not all about the quantity. Here we have a sound with a fundamental frequency of 500 Hz and its first 4 harmonics at 1000, 1500, 2000, and 2500 Hz, and each overtone with an amplitude of 1/n. These are integer multiples of the fundamental. 

 And here we have a similar sound with a fundamental of 500 Hz, with its first 4 overtones, and each overtone with an amplitude of 1/n. The only difference is that the frequency of the overtones was slightly modified. The new overtone frequencies are: 995, 1515, 2020, and 2450 Hz, they are no longer integer multiples of the fundamental. 

 The first sounds cleaner than the second because in the first all the overtones are harmonics, all overtones are integer multiples of the fundamental. In contrast, none of the overtones of the second sound are integer multiples of the fundamental, which translates to a dirtier sound. We can hear and see how a ""clean"" sound becomes ""dirtier"" by adding each overtone individually over time.  This is a sine wave (clean sound) turning into a square wave (dirty sound) over the period of 20 seconds, same note C 523.25Hz (WARNING, the loudness at the end is significantly higher than at the start, be careful with your local sound levels!): 

 Notice how the sound becomes dirtier as we add more overtones, as the sound turns from a sine wave into a square wave?  Here we can see how overtones are being added over time. From top to bottom is: at 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 seconds: 



 This difference in overtones can be found in acoustic instruments too. Let's look at the overtones of 3 instruments: a clarinet, a piano, and a trumpet, all played in C 261.62Hz. Clarinet:  Piano:  Trumpet:  We can see that the trumpet is much more rich in overtone content than the clarinet and the piano; the trumpet is ""dirtier"". "
What are the four chords that so many pop songs are based on?,"This chord progression is common enough to have a Wikipedia page: I–V–vi–IV progression The 'axis of awesome' video you refer to is talking specifically about those chords in that particular order - I–V–vi–IV - which is a feature of many prominent pop hits. 
(I'm sure you're aware of this, but for any other readers: just because this is one common chord progression doesn't mean that there aren't dozens of other common chord progressions in pop... as well as some uncommon ones! The idea that all pop songs are based on the same 4 chords is a joke, not a serious assertion.) Of course those 4 diatonic functions - the Tonic (I), Subdominant (IV), Dominant (V) and Submediant (vi) - are arguably the 4 most important in major tonality, so it's unsurprising that these chords are common, and as b3ko mentions below, that many other popular chord progressions use these 4 chords."
"When tuning a guitar, how should I strike the strings?","All stringed instruments, to my knowledge, do this; the note starts out sharp, and stabilizes after a half-second or so. The lower the string is in pitch, the longer the effect lasts.  Pluck the string gently, not near the bridge (over the 12th fret is good, just stay away from the bridge), in order to get the most even tone possible, wait a hair, then tune. I generally tune without a pick for that reason. Some tuners don't pick up the lower-pitched strings well; I'll tune to a harmonic if that's the case.  (Edit: As has been pointed out in the comments, an exception to the above is when you're going to be playing just short, choppy notes in a song. In that case, you might consider tuning to the beginning of the note, not the tail of it.)  As to why this happens, perhaps that's a question for physics.se.  More information about tuning than you ever wanted to know: Guitar Tuning Nightmares Explained"
How to prevent one mistake from derailing an entire piece?,"You have to practice the skill of playing onwards after making a mistake. You might have to start by having the music in front of you, finding the place where you made the mistake in the music, and reading the next measure until you can get back into it. When practicing this, don't let yourself back up and play over the mistake notes correctly. Leave the mistake there and focus on what comes after it. Another way is to practice starting pieces in the middle, at different points. Again, working with the sheet music will help with this. You might start off by playing from right after a key change or other major change in the piece, and then progress to starting at a random measure. A related skill is being able to audiate (hear it in your mind) the whole piece while you play it. If you can imagine what the next notes are supposed to sound like, it should make it easier to pick up where you're supposed to be. You can practice this the same way you learn the piece with your fingers. Imagine from the beginning and go as far as you can, possibly humming at first if that helps you. The ultimate challenge is having a metronome that plays a different sound on the first beat of each measure and you play along with that, keeping up with where you would be in the music if you never made a mistake. If you can completely stop playing, audiate along with the metronome and then come back in again where you would be if you had never stopped, you know you're ready for anything. Note that this last skill is pretty much required to play in an ensemble of any size."
Does the audio an instrument emits above 20 KHz affect how the instrument sounds?,"As far as I know up to this point there is exactly 0 scientific indication that any human will perceive music differently due to ultrasonic sound content, no matter what turntable producers want to make you believe. High frequencies of certain parts of instruments might affect the sound due to non linearity. E.g. an Aetherophone uses a very high frequency oscillator mixed with a second high frequency oscillator, which produced the difference frequency which might then be audible. But generally this will rather affect low frequencies than high ones, as high frequencies experience more dampening, and less effects will actually result in an audible distortion. But the high frequencies actually emitted by the instrument – most likely no."
Why would a teacher ban the metronome altogether?,"It sounds to me like you are using the metronome in an effective manner.  Your teacher might have been concerned that you, as a young student, would have seen playing in perfect time as an artistic objective. Of course it is rarely such. The musical artist is expressing emotion and other aesthetic insights. Variety of all kinds should be deployed for that purpose, with the test of effectiveness almost never perfectly consistent rhythm, but rather appropriately expressive rhythm.  However, to do this well, you must establish control over your sense of time, so you deploy it appropriately. The sort of drill you describe sounds great for this purpose.  When it comes to preparing for performance, however, turn the metronome off, set it aside, go forth and express thyself. Be steady when you need to be steady, speed up and slow down as the piece and your process of breathing life into it dictate. "
What determines a chord's name?,"Let's take Tim's major scale as a starting point and build diagrams from there. This will get heavy beyond 7 chords, but they're intermediate/advanced so I may need correcting by some jazz experts! Taking 1 as the Root of the major scale and each number representing the degree of the major scale: 1 3 5 = the 1st, 3rd and 5th notes of the major scale. b=Flat, #=Sharp Triads Major: 1 3 5 Minor: 1 b3 5 diminished: 1 b3 b5 Augmented: 1 3 #5 sus2: 1 2 5 sus4: 1 4 5 7 Chords 7 or Dominant 7: 1 3 5 b7 maj7: 1 3 5 7 min7: 1 b3 5 b7 diminished 7: 1 b3 b5 bb7 (note that all 3 non root notes are diminished/flattened)

minor/major7: 1 b3 5 7 See also: Wiki on 7ths 5:1 5 (also known as a power chord) 6: 1 3 5 6 min6: 1 b3 5 6 add 9: 1 3 5 9 add 11: 1 3 5 11 add 13: 1 3 5 13 9: 1 3 5 b7 9 11: 1 3 5 b7 9 11 13 13: 1 3 5 b7 9 11 13 Beyond that is starts to get complicated You can combine the names of the basic triads with the later chords to spell even more, for example:
augmented add 9  = 1 3 #5 9 And you can apply the naming of 7 chords to 9, 11 and 13 chords, for example:
Maj9 = 1 3 5 7 9
dim9 = 1 b3 b5 bb7 9 (note that 9 is not diminished!) This gets a little tricky, but when naming tones with a 7 you do it per tone, for example: 7/6 = 1 3 5 6 b7
7/#9 = 1 3 5 b7 #9
7#9b13 = 1 3 5 b7 #9 11 Also, remember that 9, 11 and 13 can also be thought of as 2, 4 and 6, so: 7/6 = 1 3 5 6 b7
could be writtten as
7 add 13: 1 3 5 b7 13 I'm going to hold it there, because to be honest those last 4 lines took about 2 hours of research to confirm.  I know the theory but I'm not in a place where I use them regularly yet. Perhaps someone else could clarify how you would write a chord that's a diminished triad, but with a 7, 9 etc on top, so 1 b3 b5 7, because I couldn't find anywhere mentioning the theory and a chord namer just listed it as Cmb5 maj7. On Sus chords
The simple definition is that a sus chord is a chord with the 3rd moved to either the 2nd or the 4th, but the full story gives a wide picture of where it came from and how to use it. A suspended chord is the modern result of what is called a ligature. Originally it was when you held on to a note from the previous chord and delayed its resolution.  In a sus 4 chord you have a tension between the root and the 4th that traditionally would then resolve to the 3rd, like so  Over time the sus chord became a chord in its own right rather than as a passing chord.  It's still very common to resolve a sus chord, as in the ever popular D - D sus pattern on guitar but, it also has a life of its own in other places. The default sus chord these days is a sus 4 chord, so when you see sus on its own it means sus 4, and sus2 will be named sus2.

Are Hanon exercises mindless unmusical repetiton or a great way to develop finger strength and dexterity?,"There are several schools of piano teaching. I have been raised in the idea that almost all technical training should be done with a specific piece of composed music as a target, not in isolation, and should be defined by the teacher after observation of a student's playing. It does not take long to write down a little exercice on a sheet of paper. The art of teaching is to propose gradually challenging piece from the repertoire while covering the most important technical ground. Chopin and Liszt were the first piano studies which were also works of art by themselves and had a vision wider than the style of their time. Clementi, Hanon, Kunz, and consorts are in my little teaching experience a very good way to put off students and not achieve anything worthwhile.
But other school of piano playing may have an efficient tradition of using them for the student's good. I do not know how to do that. I know how to do that with Bach, Schumann, Debussy, Scarlatti, Bartok, Chopin. Czerny is something else, I would recommend some of his studies from his pedagogical works, but again according to what you desire to be able to play and with a grain of salt. Studying too much (and too soon) without pause, regularity and progressiveness, denying the pain, believing that forcing and striking hard will give you better fingers, is the most common and real source of wrist dammage, hand inflamation and traumatism, not a specific set of piano exercices."
Performance practice of Viennese Waltz,"Even if I would not take the late Karajan as a reference for this, you are right, the first beat of each bar of a Wiener Waltzer is almost always played short; usually the leading voice is even slightly in advance of the bass when the melody is written in 3 quarter notes. This can be approximated as removing 1/6th of the first beat and adding it in advance of the second one.  It is also a very important clue to use when dancing the waltz (we are talking of an original quick Austrian waltz, not what is often called waltz in the US but is usually danced two times slower). When turning (by opposition to Pendel Schrift) during the time between the first two beats the man builds momentum and release it a little more slowly thereafter. Most people trying to dance the waltz with strictly even beats fail to be gracious or enjoy the dance; that is why a teacher I know advises to begin as early as possible to count bars and not inner steps. This is specific to Viennese waltzes composed for dancing in the European tradition (Strauss family, Lanner, van Suppe, Waldteufel, ...), in opposition to the American slow waltz, Boston, etc. It is difficult to say what to do about the waltz form as a piano form, especially Chopin. They are very specific and often played at tempo incompatible with dancing (either too slow or too quick), and Chopin reportedly said he was not able to write waltzes like Mr Strauss -- this could have been a very strong critic. In an orchestra, you would depend on the conductor's cue to choose the placement of the second beat. As a solo player this is a difficult choice to make. It requires more dexterity to play the second beat closer to the first but it could add some welcome lightness to the music."
What's the best way to fly commercially with a guitar?,"A fully fitted flightcase is a starter. Lockable, but openable with a special key which customs should have. Is it a solid, semi or acoustic guitar?  Try to get a case which is the smallest possible. That way, you may be able to take it into the cabin with you - by far the best way. Last time I flew with an electric solid, it was in a flightcase, and I nearly got onto the plane with it. (I was told it'd be o.k.) Stopped at the last hurdle, and it had to go unto the hold. Return flight, just carried it onto the plane, and the steward helped me puy it into overhead compartment.  But in any case (!) any guitar going even out of the house should be in a proper solid case - if it means anything to the owner. "
"Learning the musical concepts in the book ""Gödel, Escher, Bach""","As someone who has no formal training in music whatsoever but who fell in love with Beethoven and Bach upon hearing them, I discovered that my visual senses are much better at picking out patterns than my auditory senses. Here is a rendition of Bach's great fugue BWV 542 which shows it all to you while sacrificing none of the auditory pleasures derived from hearing this work. Sometimes just visually looking at what's being played is all you need. The patterns are just so obvious when you hear them AND see them. In this case you'll see what a fugue is and a few of the things Bach is doing with the main melody. You will quite literally see the individual voices. I recommend playing this a few times and focusing on one voice so that you can see and hear what it is doing. Here is his Fugue BWV 565. In general I recommend any MIDI viewing program and then you can get free MIDIs (for example here), open them up in your favorite MIDI viewer and view the piano roll. There are plenty of paid ones of course but the one I like is called Synthesia which has a pretty good free version and it does everything I need it for. And here is a sample of what Synthesia does. I am still ridiculously slow at sight reading but using MIDI viewers, I can now play my favorite pieces from Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, and Mozart for my own pleasure."
Is my Yamaha guitar counterfeit?,"Yup, probably. A few reasons I say this: Here's the closest example I could find: a Yamaha FG-402. The sticker pattern has the same kind of border as the one you posted, but the sticker itself is shaped to the border instead of rectangular.  This image also clearly shows where you would find the serial number. It also brings up something else. See the language used on the sticker in that picture: Made by Kaohsiung Yamaha Co., Ltd.
  in Taiwan in accordance with specifications of
Yamaha Corporation Whereas your sticker appears to say: Made in Japan
  in accordance with specification of
Yanaha Corporation Typos are a HUGE indicator for counterfeit merchandise. After quickly looking over the other imagery you provided, I think the logo on the headstock in particular is quite suspect. I believe the ""YAMAHA"" wordmark is not in the correct typeface. If you compare it to the inside sticker (which in your case is probably a photocopy), the middle stems of the letter ""M"" are not supposed to meet the baseline in the proper wordmark, but on your headstock it does appear to. Also the other letters (""Y"" in particular) look too wide to me. Every other genuine Yamaha guitar you ever see will have the same exact wordmark, in the exact same typeface."
Why can't I whistle and hum different notes at the same time?,"The only difference between singing and humming is really where the air is going. Since you're directing the air through your mouth to form a whistle, this can't be humming, you're actually singing and whistling at the same time. When I taught myself how to do this, I did notice that the two pitches were moving together at first, but I'll bet if you worked on it in the right way you could learn to control the distinct muscle groups individually. This is actually rather similar to multiphonics on a brass instrument, where the lip buzz and the sung tone must be controlled individually in many cases. There is probably some innate neural reason why we have trouble with this; whatever it is, it is clear that 99% of human-controlled musical tones are single line, so we have a very strong neural link between a single pitch and a muscular setting. Audiating two pitches at a time and then controlling different muscle groups for each is a pretty tall order given that context, but it can be done. Here are some things you can try: Given that, try singing and whistling simultaneously. Once you've got it steady, try moving the tongue back and forth. If you're only thinking about the muscle and not about the note, you should hear a change in pitch of the whistle. Changing sung note while sustaining a whistled one is the same thing with the opposite muscle group. I'd recommend starting with the tongue because it's a very easy muscle to localize your brain's control over. After you've got that down, then it's just a matter of refining control and linking each individual muscle group back to your musical mind. Good luck!"
Why is an amplifier's effects loop useful?,"It is useful because it allows you to add effects to your sound after it has been through the amps EQ and pre-amp;  What this means; the pre-amp can do its magic on a clean signal from your guitar; before effects are added. Adding effects which boost(overdrive/distortion) the signal into the effects loop can be dangerous for the amp, as the signal has already been boosted by the pre-amp; it should be ok if you experiment with it and are careful, but is not advisable.  Generally these things(boosters) should go in front of your amp; though if your preamp is up high; they will have little effect. Modulators like phasers/chorus/delay can go in the effects loop; and will probably be better for your tone if there, since the your applying the effect to the already boosted signal from the preamp, instead of boosting a signal with an effect on it. Unless you specifically want your modulators before the boosters this is a good rule of thumb:  boosters -> preamp -> modulators."
Why guitar sounds smoother in high frets?,"Partly due to the thicker string gauge, but also because you will be plucking the string closer to its middle point (if your pick or R.H. finger/thumb plucks in the same place.) This excites fewer of the upper harmonics of the string, giving a mellower sound. In classical guitar music you are often asked to play closer to the middle of the string to produce a mellower sound; this can be marked dolce, which literally translates to sweetly, or can be marked sul tasto (over the fingerboard). The opposite of this is pont. or ponticello (near the bridge) or metallico, which asks for a brittle sound. On electric guitar this mellow effect, of playing the same note on a lower string, is also due to the relative position of the pickups. Whichever pickup you are using is now closer to the middle of the string. (If you think about the relative positioning, the bridge pickup now has the equivalent positioning of the neck pickup; the neck pickup is now likely to be very close to the middle of the string.)"
What should I consider when I see a loose hair in a violin bow?,"A loose hair won't vibrate the string in any useful way, and it may catch at unwanted moments. Remove it, just as you would a broken hair. "
Difference between keys and scales?,"[A scale is] just a bunch of notes the composer decided to use in his
  music. This is correct, or at least it's a valid way to look at it. In western music, the key chosen for a piece implies both a scale and a tonal center, but alternate scales may be used without changing key, and in some ways and some forms of music, the tonal center may also change without it being considered a change of key.  If someone tells you a piece is in the key of A minor, then you can assume you will use the A minor scale for least the beginning, end, and a good portion of the piece. It won't always be just like that, but it's the best assumption. There may be some use of the A harmonic minor scale and/or the A natural minor scale in western music without changing the key of the piece, which can still be in A minor. To be clear, in Western music it is not uncommon to use multiple scales in a single piece, even if that piece stays in the same key the entire time. In Western classical music, it is very common for a piece to have more than one key, with one or more scale being used in each key. In general, the number of scales used in a piece is equal to or greater than the number of keys used. So, each key comes with one scale attached to it, with other scales that go along with that key being optional. A mode is a special kind of scale. You can think of a mode as just being a scale, and we just use the word ""mode"" for some scales and ""scale"" for others. Confusingly, some patterns of notes have two different names, one ""scale"" name and one ""mode"" name. As you work to understand scales and keys, it's all right to consider ""mode"" to be another word for ""scale"". As you understand more, you'll see why there is a separate word for it, but at the beginning just consider them to be the same thing."
"What are the characteristic scales, keys, intervals, progressions, etc. of pirate / sailing / nautical music?","I've had a go writing some nautical-sounding music for games before. Andrew's answer about using Dorian is helpful - here's a few other tips I have. For a piratey sound, accordions work well. They're characterised by a stride bass pattern (bass note on beats 1 and 3, chord on 2 and 4) the folk-style melodies are heavily swung, lots of dotted notes. Sticking to really simple folky chord sequences works well for a shanty sound. Try For more of a Royal Navy feel: penny whistles, snare drums, straighter rhythms. ""Sailor's Hornpipe"" is worth a listen. If you want to put drums in your pirate tune, something like a bodhran would probably sound most authentic."
Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier Order,"What a great question! I am currently working my way through the second book, so I have more specific opinions about that. Of those I've learnt from the first book, I found the following to be less tricky: The C major prelude, of course. Curtis is right about the difficulty of the fugue, however. c minor prelude and fugue are a good first pair to learn c# minor prelude is a nice lyrical dance movement whose difficulties are mostly due to  the tricky key. The fugue on the other hand is quite complicated, although the difficult bit here is mostly playing 5 voices at the same time, not playing fast or complicated figures. The D major fugue is also quite simple as fugues go. It looks more imposing on the page than it really is (the fast fanfare figures only occur in one hand at a time, and there is a lot of stuff which is basically chords). The D major prelude is not too hard either. Most people make it hard by playing it too fast. The d minor fugue is another fairly simple fugue -- no harder than the c minor one, I would say. The prelude is a workout for arpeggio playing which can be difficult if you have problems with tension in your arms and wrists. Eb minor prelude is a very nice slow sarabande with mostly chords in the left hand and the right hand playing the role of a solo instrument. The fugue is difficult though (d# minor!). The E major prelude is not too hard, and very pretty -- another dance-like piece The e minor fugue is in two parts only, which obviously makes it somewhat simpler to learn. The first half of the e minor prelude is not bad, but it gets harder at the second half marked ""presto""! Finally, the F major prelude and fugue is another nice pair to start with -- on about the same level as the c minor and d minor. Here are the pieces I've found easier in book two, so far: The C major fugue is quite straightforward. The prelude is not very hard but sustaining the long notes and making the whole thing flow can be tricky. The c minor prelude is more or less a two-part invention. The fugue is for four parts, but only in three for long stretches -- maybe a good first four-voiced fugue to learn? The D major prelude has a lot of repeating patterns of scales and arpeggios which eases the learning a bit, and the fanfare-like character makes it easier to get into compared to some of the more abstract pieces. The fugue is not bad for a four-part fugue, but it requires a good legato on the piano to keep the voices connected. d minor prelude is another invention, and the three-part fugue is straightforward, although rhythmically and harmonically peculiar (lots of chromatic descending scales) The E major and Eb fugue are not too tricky for four-part fugues. Their preludes are moderately difficult, I'd say.  The F major fugue is fast but not really very complicated, if you've played something like a Gigue from a French Suite. The f minor prelude is simple and beautiful; the f minor fugue (3 voices) is not bad apart from the tricky key. I'd say the same about the f# minor prelude. The G major fugue is fast and fun -- mostly arpeggios. The prelude is similar. Like the d minor prelude from book one, they can be tiring if you have trouble playing arpeggios and similar wrist-rotation techniques in a relaxed way (or when taken too fast ;->) Wow, that's much more than I meant to write. Hope it's useful to someone! I haven't really gotten much further than halfway with either book, so there may well be other less-difficult pieces which I've overlooked. But I think these are reasonable starting points."
When should I be concerned about calibrating the bias of vacuum tubes in an amplifier?,"There are many methods of biasing.  Those applied to the preamp tubes generally use cathode bias which is a small resistor with optional capacitor in parallel. What this does is effectively create a voltage source in series with the cathode with raises it above ground. This has the same effect as lowering the grid voltage below ground by the same amount.  By reducing the capacitor size or even eliminating it you introduce negative feedback. This reduces the gain but increases the linearity of the signal. The capacitor fixes the voltage which ultimately depends on the quiescent current. The standard resistor value is about 1.5k which puts the grid about 1.5V below the cathode(or the cathode 1.5V above the grid). A normal 12AX7 can take a grid input from about 0 volts to -4 volts. Below about -4 volts the tube will cut off as it cannot turn off any further. 0 volts on the grid allows current to flow and anything above this allows even more. 0 volts on the grid on a cathode biased tube is really the negative of the cathode bias. So if you have 1.5V on the cathode due to cathode bias putting 0 volts on the grid will set the tube to be somewhere between completely on and completely off.  You find the right amount to give you the most gain and the most linearity and the lowest noise. If your guitar signal's transients are too large then they will clip(the tube can't turn off any further no matter how large the signal is). This is how we get pre-amp distortion but we do it by sending in a larger signal than we normally should. For your first tube you do not want this unless you want to get distortion from your clean sound. You can change the grid resistor from about 0 ohms to 3k ohms and still get a good usable signal. To my ears the best value sounds around 1.5k. The other method is to use fixed bias which applies the voltage to the grid directly. This is just another way to do the same above but it doesn't have any feedback capabilities and is easier to adjust(since you don't have to change out a resistor). In this case though the voltage doesn't depend on the quiescent current which means you don't have to calculate or probe it. For power amp tubes, one has exactly the same type of concept since they are just ""bigger"" pre-amp tubes. (A pentode is a triode with 2 extra grids but otherwise functions along the same lines) A power amp tube is generally biased using fixed bias because you don't want it to change that much(big changes in current going through it = big change is cathode bias) and you want as much gain as you can get(cause that's the whole point of a power stage). The same kinda principles apply but in a power stage the grid can swing usually to around -80V for the grid instead of -4 for a triode. This means the bias is much lower(around -40V). Changing the bias effects the location on the operating point of the load line. This effectively sets up the ""operating current"". It is important only in that the tube has a maximum power output it can handle. When running a tube in linear mode almost any location can work as long as your operating within spec. The problem is that when you want maximum gain and your input is large you start getting near or into the non-linear regions of the tube. This is where biasing can be important and can be different for two tubes. Effectively the load line is given by I = (Vcc + u*Vg)/R The two extremes are when I = 0 and when Vg = 0. Note that when I = 0 we have Vg = -Vcc/u. This means that for smaller u we have larger possible grid voltage swings. This is why you generally want to use a lower gain tube as the input such as the 12ay7. The problem is these are dual triodes and it will effect the 2nd tube two which may be used for more gain. This will reduce the overall distortion of a hi-gain channel which may not be desirable. This can be fixed by changing the circuitry since all tubes have enough gain to drive any stage. For example, the input tube takes a signal about 1Vrms and outputs a signal(theoretically) of 100Vrms(for u = 100 such as a 12ax7). This drives the input grid of another tube. But the grid can only swing from about 0 to -5V. So we have way to much gain for it. Therefore massive clipping would occur. Attenuation is needed. So even a u = 40(12ay7) would work except that it would be attenuated by the same divider. If we changed the divider circuit we could recover the lost gain and not lose possible power(which ultimately comes from the power amp tubes but they have to be driven by a large enough signal to get that power). Mostly that stuff above is for pre-amp tubes and even though the same thing applies to power amp tubes you generally focus more on power amp tubes for a few reasons. Power amps generally are in class AB push pull. This means that you have two tubes working against each other which removes the current in the transformer(for dc anyways). If the tubes are not balanced you'll get current in the transformer which can burn it up. Power amps are bias effects how ""hot"" the tubes run. The hotter the better up to a point before the tubes melt. Some amp manufacturers intentionally run the tubes very cold to save money(they extend the life of the tubes that they ship them with).  Power amps are the workhorses of an amp that actually give the amp it's power gain rather than just voltage gain. If the bias is too low then the current will be too large through the tubes but also through other components which may gradually fail over time causing other components to fail more. Tubes must be unbalanced slightly as to reduce crossover distortion. This is nasty distortion that is prevalent at lower volumes. This is one of the reasons running a push-pull amp as loud as possible gives the best sound as the crossover distortion is masked out. For power amp tubes you can rebias them and even balance the tubes if they are unbalanced(not a great way but better than nothing but generally requires extra work to do so). You can make your tubes hotter or colder to improve the sound.  There are many things you can do to an amp to make it sound better. ""Stock"" amps generally are designed to increase lifespan and profit margins rather than tone. "
Unknown Musical Symbol: Straight Dotted Line Between Eighth Note Stems,"In Haydn's time, short beams were used in the same way as short slurs in modern music, i.e. to show articulation. Since much sheet music at that time was hand-written, this convention saved time for the copyists - and it's just as easy to read as modern slurs, when you know what it means! I haven't looked at the OP's particular example, but in some critical editions this type of ""dotted"" beaming is used to show differences in beaming between different hand copies of the same piece, or to show editorial ""corrections"" where different beaming was used for different repetitions of the same musical phrase within the piece. (Whether such changes are really ""corrections"" or just editorial pedantry is a different question, of course!)"
How do I begin finally making music on the piano?,"I'd advise you to sit down and improvise and play tunes that you know by ear, so that you can really build associations in your mind between what your fingers do and what you hear. Studying theory is helpful, but you're going to have to start connecting it to what you do and hear in real time (like learning to think in a foreign language instead of just translating it to your native language). For example, you could try to pick a key and play the melody of ""Jingle Bells"" in that key, then go on to accompany it with chords. Or you could find a chord progression, play it and improvise a melody that goes with it."
Why does plucked and bowed string of violin produces slightly different pitches?,"Many things can enter in.  Bow pressure can force a string out of tune. Try this: tune the open string bowed, then play the string with excessively heavy bow pressure.  You'll go out of tune. Depending on the quality of the instrument, the bridge&soundpost setup, and the phases of Jupiter's moons,  you may find that a perfectly tuned (bowed) open string will decay slightly out of tune after you remove the bow.  The behavior of a freely oscillating string differs from that of a string driven with a bow. From a physics standpoint, the resonant frequency of a string under tension, for real-world strings (not those infamous massless ones :-) ), can change with amplitude.  Add to that the fact that a plucked string is resonating freely, while a bowed string is actually being caught and released by the bowhairs (at a very high rate), and the math gets well-nigh impossible.  I fear I don't have any info as to what the magnitudes of these various effects are. Perhaps someone can chime in w/ some references. "
"What is the connection between time-signature, beat, and tempo?","Time signatures are primarily for notational purposes. Beat, tempo, and meter all describe a certain thing about the music, but the time signature is just how that's codified when it's written down. As you know, Tempo is the frequency of the beat, and Beats are a kind of rhythmic emphasis that happens at regular intervals in most music. Meter is an important term--that tells us how each beat is subdivided (i.e. in two or in three) and how to group beats into larger chunks, also at regular intervals. Time signatures, plus information about tempo, tells us how to get all of that information from notes written on the page. A quarter note alone has very little meaning until we contextualize it in terms of what note value the beat is assigned to and what the frequency of beats is. You are correct in noticing that there is overlap between tempo markings and time signatures. That is because, while there are some conventions for how they usually relate, these conventions can be broken. Consider 4/4 time with a tempo marking of q = 60 (bpm). This one is simple, there are sixty quarter notes per minute, and four quarter notes per measure. But what if the tempo marking was h (half note) = 60? There's no hard and fast rule that says the tempo marking has to be equivalent to the time signature (and in fact in 6/8, it rarely is), but in that case, there are still four quarter notes to each measure, it's just that the tempo is being given in how many half notes there are per minute. Tempo is usually given with a note duration. If that duration is missing, then you can usually assume that it is referring to the bottom part of the time signature. But it is fairly rare to just see a number at the top of the page without any context. In the example you give, there is no note value assigned to the beat, so you would assume that it is referring to the quarter note for time signatures of 4/4 and 2/4. For 6/8, things get a little bit hairy. This time signature always means that there are six eighth notes per measure, but not always does the eighth note get the beat! 6/8 is most commonly used to refer to a duple meter with a triple subdivision. This means that a dotted quarter note would get the beat, and each beat would be divided into three eighth notes. Most American folk songs fit this model (think about how you would write down ""Pop Goes the Weasel""), and 6/8 time is used to avoid writing a triplet figure over every subdivided beat. 6/8 tempo markings are usually written as q. (dotted quarter) = x, but they occasionally will be e (eighth note) = x, signifying that you have six beats per measure."
