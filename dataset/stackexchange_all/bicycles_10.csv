Terminology index - a list of bike part names and cycling concepts,"A derogatory term for a very cheaply produced bike with very low quality components. The components can be hard to maintain due to poor tolerances. BSOs are often sold at non-specialty retail stores. The etymology of the term is uncertain. It appears in use in some parts of the English-speaking world. It may originate in the UK, as discussed at the link. Other languages may use terms equivalent to supermarket bike or department store bike. These terms are likely to be understood in English as well.  For instance the BSO pictured is being sold in the UK by ASDA (owned by Walmart) for £75. These bikes tend to be mass produced and sold in flat pack boxes for self-assembly. Purchasers of lower-end bicycles tend to be less experienced cyclists who focus on price. Many BSOs carry features which are included for marketing purposes but are unnecessary for the typical end-user. Such features may include front and rear suspension, wide off-road style tyres and an excessive number of gear ratios. For cyclists who are riding on city streets or smooth trails, these features are unnecessary. Including these features reduces the budget available for better components elsewhere. It is more advisable to search for a cheap second-hand bike in a similar price range from a more experienced cyclist or on eBay than to go for one of these."
Why ride a fixed-gear bike?,"Your understanding is correct.  Why do people ride them? Some random answers: Hard to get started/Hard to go fast? Yes. Generally someone who has a road worthy fixie will have selected a gear that works well for the terrain and speed that they like to ride at. I've only ridden fixed gear bikes on the track, but I'd imagine for a city fixie, you'd optimize for a fairly low speed but someone who takes these more seriously can answer better."
How do I deal with a dog chasing me when I'm touring?,"Oh... where do I even start? I love dogs, I am crazy about them, too. I have 3 labs of my own. I am from a place where street dogs are very abundant. If you don't see any dogs in the next 100 yards, consider yourself lost! :D I am barked at often, chased often, even confronted sometimes. I used to run away before, because it is what a normal guy does. I learned a very big thing about dogs. They chase wimps. It's like what a bully does, going after the weakest target. So, don't you dare run when you are bullied. Take a bite instead but stand your ground.  They sense fear. If you are scared while approaching a dog, he is sure to suspect you and bark/chase you. They love challenges. If they think you are a worthy adversary they will confront you either to be protective or to see who is stronger in the area. Me, for a guy, who was constantly afraid of dogs, was suddenly in charge, after learning a little of these dog psychology tips.  Therefore, please believe me when I am saying this  Show them, you are ready. Call it like ""Bring it on"" If a dog passes this point, and still heading towards you then you are in a serious point. Where there are only three things to do. Surrender: Another  psychology of dogs, if they pass that point, they are challenging you head on. So, better lower your body, sit down. Let the dog be taller than you. Don't care about him, or look at him. Instead hook a headphone in your ear and listen to the music.  Music will calm your nerves down and send positive impulses for the dog to sense. Let him smell you. After few moments, just get up calmly grab your bike, start walking with it (but don't ride off) I have tried this so many times, its freaky but works Call for help: If the dog has an owner, (s)he may hear you if they are nearby. Or somebody might help you get out of this trouble. Get ready to fight: When nothing works, better get yourself prepared for the fight. From my own experience, dogs love to tear limbs. If they grab your limb, you just feel helpless. Avoid this Protect your neck, hands and calf muscles at all cost. If they are hurt you have very slim of escaping. Be defensive, rather than offensive: Let him make the first move and on retaliation you can do whatever you want. Effective targets are nose and eyes they will buy you a lot of time and you can make a run for it. If you are lucky try to find a long stick. They are greatest weapons against dogs. Don't hit them. Just point it right at them and show them you will do it. Even a mini pump works, if you find nothing. Don't let him corner you, keep the motion going,  Normally when this happens, me and dog are generally circling each other Make a little cage out of your bike. When you are cornered, this just might save your life. Grabbing tail, makes him more angry, try to avoid that. Do not scare a dog and run away. They become enemy for life.  Update: Rabid Dogs Getting into a fighting situation with a rabid dog, is more harmful than it should be.  One of my little story: One of my friend got into a similar situation with me, on a village cycle trip. A rabid dog was being chased by locals (its not abnormal here) and the dog out of fright ended up attacking us. My friend was a pretty agile cyclist, he immediately changed to defense position with his bike covering his entire body stopping the first attack. But, at a moment when dog was jumping at us, he used his elbow to hit the dog, but it bit him very badly.  Very torturous and painful moment we were in. Worst part than the wound was the infection. So, I suggest full defence no offence as much as possible, but if you are a fighter/ Martial Arts Expert or know how to protect yourself very well, then yes, sick dog are very easy to knock down just aim for the nose."
"Safety data: Which is safer, head/tail lights which blink or emit a steady beam?","The short answer is that 'safer' is subjective and depends on your requirements. You are both correct.  Movement attracts the eye, so your blinking light is noticed.  It is easier to judge the position of a steady state light. For a motorist to pick out your tail light, particularly, from a sea of noise is very difficult.  The surface area of the light is tiny, and it's all on its own.  Your light is just not important enough to notice amongst the jumble of signs, traffic directions and other cars unless it does something to stand out, like flash. My understanding is that the reason it's easy to see cars (apart from bulk) is that they have 2 lights moving together.  Something to do with your brain automagically resolving the connected pattern.  That's why it's hard to see a car with one working taillight, or a motorcycle or bicycle. In terms of safety, my policy is always 'be seen and misjudged' rather than 'not seen'. So I always set both front and rear lights to blink at night.  If you need illumination for the road, I'd strongly suggest a second forward light for that. From Rear Lighting Configurations for Winter Maintenance Vehicles Flashing lights will be perceived as having higher brightness than steady-burning lights, up to a flash frequency of about 15 flashes per second. Such brightness enhancement can aid in conspicuity, and several rear lighting systems have been designed to have a flash rate between 5 and 9 flashes per second in order to maximize their perceived brightness. While conspicuity may be greater with such configurations, an observer’s ability to make accurate judgements of relative speed or distance may be compromised when flashing or strobing lights are used. Croft observed that the judgments required in tracking an object were difficult to make under strobing conditions, yet very easy in steady-lighting conditions. Observations made during a study of service vehicle lighting for maintenance operations similarly pointed out that strobing and flashing systems designed for maximum conspicuity can at the same time reduce one's ability to judge relative speed and distance. Periodic sampling of the field of view in another study resulted in deterioration of one's motion-tracking ability that increased as the distance to the object of interest decreased. Also from Selection and Application of Warning Lights on Roadway Operations Equipment Flashes are bursts of light which, by definition, are unexpected
  because they do not occur in nature (save for lightning).
  This characteristic is their most important feature and
  why they are so good at capturing attention."
How to clean up at work after a commute?,"My commute was fairly short, so my major burden was the rain. For this I invested in rain proof panniers & waterproof jacket & over-trousers. I had both a summer & winter jacket to make sure I didn't arrive in too hot during summer. I didn't have overshoes, so kept spare socks/shoes at office.  I cycled at leisurely pace on way there to avoid building up too much of a sweat. I'd let rip on the way home to make up for that. I had a colleague who cycled in from further afield, and wore the spandex gear. He just discretely got changed in the toilets when he arrived. It was never an issue (odour wise) - I guess he went with the babywipes & deodorant. Our dress code was pretty casual. If you need to be smart, just bring your freshly ironed office clothes in a pannier. See if you can get a suction bag to prevent them from flopping all over the place enroute."
Why are disc brakes rare on road bikes? (circa 2010) [closed],"Disc brakes are now common on road bikes, even racing road bikes in the professional peloton. Most of the major bike manufacturers offer disc and non-disc options for most of their bike models. Some ""endurance"", ""adventure"", and ""cyclocross"" (drop bar bikes sold under ""road"" category, but intended for some off-road use) models only offer options with disc brakes now. However, there is some opposition to their use in certain types of road racing. If a rider's leg contacts a disc rotor while the bike is going fast, that rotor will likely cause a serious injury (it's spinning fast and pretty thin, so cuts flesh easily). The advantages of disc brakes are primarily in wet and/or muddy conditions. In dry conditions, a good rim brake can lock both wheels up just as well as a disc brake. So for road-racing under dry conditions, there's no real advantage to disc brakes, and appears to be some disadvantages. Many of the ""racer"" style road bikes follow what's allowed for professional road bike racing, so it's possible that the current opposition to disc brakes in professional road racing will eventually lead to them becoming less popular on road bikes. Personally, my next new bike will definitely have disc brakes. I don't race in a peloton, I do sometimes ride in the wet, and it's much cheaper to replace a rotor than to replace a rim or wheel. (rim brakes eventually wear down the rim and make you replace it) I think it mostly comes down to one primary thing: disc brakes weigh more and road bikes are supposed to be light.  Also, you need a heavier wheel and heavier fork to handle the forces of disc braking, which compounds the weight. Additionally, the advantages to disc brakes (working better in mud/dirt, easier to work with a suspension, work with really wide tires) generally don't apply to road bikes or aren't what the road bike was designed for.  For any bike on the road the only likely advantage of disc brakes would be that they're more likely to work after you've ridden through something nasty (mud, puddle with oil on it, etc) that's deep enough to get on the rims, and you probably want to be avoiding any puddles you can't see the bottom of anyways. Probably the final reason is simply that disc brakes (generally) cost more than rim brakes. I have seen bikes made for the road that had disc brakes, but they're generally not the typical ""go fast"" road bike.  (Example: Kona Sutra)"
Can I use WD-40 on my bike?,"WD-40 is mostly a solvent with a very light lubricant mixed in. It's great for getting stuck parts moving again. When you spray it on, the solvent dislodges whatever gunk may be causing the part to stick and then evaporates, leaving a light lubricant behind. This will allow the previously stuck part to move again. The reason it is generally not considered a good bicycle lubricant is because it is a light lubricant. It's just fine for household items like door hinges, which aren't exposed to weather and don't get moved a couple hundred times a minute. But the lubricant is not thick enough to adhere to rapidly moving bike parts for any length of time, especially when you add a little bit of road grit and/or rain. Some people do use it for loosening up shifters in the winter time (they stick when it's cold) or cleaning chains and derailleurs. You will notice in the answers and comments on the aforelinked question that whether or not this is good practice is highly debatable. Some people will use WD-40 as a cleaner and degreaser followed by a bicycle-specific lubricant, with or without a cleaning inbetween, depending on personal preferences. I don't have any experience with their bicycle-specific products, but they're a solid company that's been in the business of cleaning and lubricating mechanical parts for a long time. They also make Lava soap and 3-in-1 Oil, a product that was originally designed as a bicycle lubricant (although they did acquire both of those from other companies). I actually didn't know until I read this question that they were making bicycle-specific lubricants now. Given their history and the number of patents that they have to draw ideas and develop from, I'm certainly willing to give them a shot. The worst case scenario is that I have to clean it off and go back to my previous products."
Why do cyclists prefer messenger bags over backpacks?,"I spent the last two years as a backcountry ranger, in Northern California.  There, I wore a backpack almost every day.  Now I am a bicycle commuter in Sacramento and I choose panniers first, a messenger bag second, and the backpack a distant third.   There are three reasons why the backpack is my last choice in this list. Any bag I carry ends up being full.  I don't know how that works, but my bag is always full of something.  A full backpack rides higher on my back than a messenger bag.  This raises my center of gravity and throws me off balance more easily.   It doesn't matter how gently I ride or what the temperature is, by the time I get to work I am soaked with sweat.  With a backpack, I sweat even more because there is less airflow between my back and the bag.  The messenger bag, which rides lower, covers less of my back and I sweat a little less.  Or maybe I just dry out quicker.   Backpacks with hipbelts and sternum straps are designed to move weight off of one's shoulders and onto the hips and torso.  This works great if you are in an upright, walking position.  When I'm in the drops on my roadbike, a hipbelt is nothing more than a hinderance and a backpack-sternum-strap, though more useful, sometimes tends to choke me.  Weight is again transferred to my shoulders and back, which causes me some degree of pain after a while.  Messenger bags--at least those that are well designed--have a strap which rides diagonnally across the sternum and which functions better in the riding position to transfer weight to the torso. Panniers are my first choice, though, because they better solve all of these problems.  They are completely off of my back and pretty low on the bike.  For longer rides and for my daily commute, I generally use panniers.   Not all of my bikes have a rack, though.  I have ridden my bike from Sacramento-to-the Bay Area wearing a messenger bag.  I wouldn't have tried it with a backpack. "
How to pass a bicycle while driving a car,"As long as you give a cyclist plenty of space, and obey traffic laws and drive safely in general you are OK. 1 meter or 3 feet is generally considered enough space when passing, but I know I prefer more. If you can move into another travel lane to overtake please do that. Don't follow a cyclist too closely before overtaking, it's really scary for the cyclist. Similarly, don't pull in too soon after overtaking. Pass decisively and reasonably quickly. Overtake only when you have enough visibility, space and time to do so. I've had cars try to overtake me then have to abort because they didn't give themselves enough space, or overtook on a curve or hill where they could not see far enough ahead. Be aware of anything that might force the cyclist away from the side of the road that reduces the separation between you and them: debris, potholes, tree branches etc. Don't overtake if you will not actually get past the cyclist, such as when coming up to a junction or another situation where you would have to slow down or stop before fully getting past the cyclist. A particularly important variant of this is 
overtaking a cyclist then immediately turning right (or left in countries that drive on the left) and cutting across the cyclist's path."
Is pollution a problem in urban cycling?,"Rank, Folke and Jespersen (2001), ""Differences in cyclists and car drivers exposure to air pollution from traffic in the city of Copenhagen"", The Science of The Total Environment, 279:131-136 teams of two cyclists and two car drivers in two cars were equipped with personal air samplers while driving for 4 hours on 2 different days in the morning traffic of Copenhagen. The air sample charcoal tubes were analysed for their benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX) content and the air filters for particles (total dust). The concentrations of particles and BTEX in the cabin of the cars were 2–4 times greater than in the cyclists’ breathing zone, the greatest difference being for BTEX. Therefore, even after taking the increased respiration rate of cyclists into consideration, car drivers seem to be more exposed to airborne pollution than cyclists."
"Why is it safer to bike with traffic, instead of facing oncoming cars?","I found this article which has some statistics on accidents involving wrong-way cycling:  Table 4 shows that all categories of bicyclists traveling against the direction of traffic flow are at greatly increased risk for accidents—on average 3.6 times the risk of those traveling with traffic, and as high as 6.6 times for those 17 and under. This result is readily explained: because motorists normally scan for traffic traveling in the lawful direction, wrong-way traffic is easily overlooked. To give only a single example, a motorist turning right at an intersection scans to the left for approaching traffic on the new road, and cannot see or anticipate a fast-moving wrong-way bicyclist approaching from the right."
How to ride to work without sweating?,"It is possible, but only in certain conditions. I live in a tropical country, so, 20 degrees centigrade is considered cold here. My conmute to work is almost flat, with only one climb, something a very steep 300 meters. If it were not for that, I'd be able to get to the office almost completely dry. What's the trick? I use a hardtail mountain bike with a small rack in the seatpost. The bike has a sporty position, but the trick is to pedal in the easy gears and making very little effort, accelerating very slowly. The effort should feel comparable to a moderate walk. Also, take as much advantage as I can from the downhills (Update: later on, I changed the tires to slick ones, that reduces the effort needed to move). However, ideal conditions are an exception. I have already told you that I have to climb a very steep hill, so I just put the easiest gear and pedal like a grandmother for that hill (While in ""sports mode"" I can climb the same hill in 4 gears higher and a quarter of the time). I sweat the minimum and I manage to avoid clothes changes, but there are other things I do to minimize body odor: All those tips are easy to implement, and can keep you from needing to change clothes. After you cool off and clean yourself with the towel, most people won't even notice a difference on you if you hadn't commuted by bike. As per anecdotal stuff, my grandfather used to commte exclusively by bike, in a small city located in the Valley of Sula (Valle de Sula) near the city of San Pedro Sula in Honduras. A valley in a tropical country has a very hot weather all year round. He used a bike similar to the ""Flying Pigeon"" (Google Flying Pigeon Bike for images). That is a heavy steel bike with 28"" wheels, a very high gearing and a very comfortable seating position. I remember that he was never sweaty, even if he commuted from workplace to his home for lunch, right under caribean sun at noon. Two elements had a big role in it: 1) the city is completely flat, no climbs, no downhills. 2) The bike he used is almost impossible to pedal in an sporty way, it kind of 'forced' you to pedal in a smooth fashion, with slow cadence, but after a while, you get some speed that is really easy to keep. It makes you feel you can go for hours without getting tired. (1) Perspiration (Wikipeia) (2) Body odor (Wikipedia) (3) Urinary system (Wikipedia)"
How to use drop handlebars properly?,"There are 3 basic hand positions that most people use on a drop bar: On the Hoods - This position allows you to reach the brakes and shifters without moving your hands and allows a fairly upright, and comfortable body position. Most riders spend 75-90% of their miles in this position. On the Drops - This position is ideal for more aerodynamic body positions, or more athletic efforts. When you want to go hard, go here. You can reach brakes and shifters, but may have to move your hands, depending on your setup. This is generally used for descending long hills, or an aggressive position. It is less stable, and it is used for maybe 10% or less of most riders' mileage. On the Tops - This position allows a comfortable alternative position for more relaxed riding. It is generally used when going at an easy pace, and in situations where you are certain of the road conditions, traffic and other hazards. You definitely can not reach the brakes or shifters from this position without moving your hands. It is less stable due to narrower hand position, though it may not feel like it. Most riders use it as a cool down position for 10% or so of their mileage. "
Why aren't Tour de France riders going any faster?,"What really struck me though was that the average speeds really haven't changed much The chart ranges from about 25km/h to over 40km/h, and that is a big change. As others have mentioned, increasing your average speed requires a non-linear increase in power applied to the pedals. In other words, to increase average speed from 25km/h to 26km/h is easier than increasing from 40km/h to 41km/h Say I were to steal a time-machine, go back and ride each TdF course, using the exact same bike. To match the winners average speed, this is the wattage I would need to produce (well, a very crude approximation):  (again, this is a very crudely approximated graph, designed to illustrate a point! It ignores stuff like wind, terrain, drafting, coasting, road surface and many other things) From around 60 watts to 240 watts is a huge change, and it's very unlikely that TdF competitors have increased their wattage this much over time.. Part of the increase will be due to more powerful cyclists (thanks to better training and nutrition), but certainly not all of it. The rest is likely due to technological improvements. For example, a more aerodynamic bike will decrease the power required for a given average speed, same with a lighter bike when going up hills. Source for graph: Although my point should remain valid regardless of how inaccurate the above graph is, here is the messy script I used to generate it It uses the data from here, exported to CSV (from this document) The average speed to required watts calculation could be simplified greatly, but it was easier for me to just modify the script from my answer here!"
What advanced cycling skills are useful for a commuter or city rider?,"Some important skills for commuters: This is a surprisingly difficult skill to master. When a rider looks directly backwards, it is common to turn in the direction they twisted their head. It takes a lot of practice to make resisting that turning automatic. The importance of looking behind you in traffic should be obvious. It is not uncommon to come up to an intersection when a vehicle in the crossing direction will come in front of you, and you will not have enough time or space to stop safely. Sometimes what is required is a countersteered* turn into the direction the crossing vehicle is traveling. This requires a quick turn of the handlebars in the opposite direction you want to turn, which will cause your center of gravity to rapidly swing to the side you want to be going. Returning the handlebars to turn in the direction you want to go completes the turn, and by doing so you can turn very rapidly with a very tight radius.  You might not be able to stop, but it can be preferable to make a sudden turn rather than crashing into something. Not many riders are highly skilled in using their brakes. Practice slamming on your brakes, especially using only the front, and get a feel for how much force it takes to get your back wheel off the ground. Practice to the point that when you are in a panic situation you don't simply clutch the levels with every ounce of strength, practice so modulating your brake power is a purely mechanical, automatic skill. Also practice stopping on sandy, wet, and icy surfaces."
"Do skilled cyclists really ""use the front brake alone probably 95% of the time""?","Reference - Cyclecraft by John Franklin A cycle takes more than twice as far to stop using only the rear brake compared to using only the front brake, which will usually stop the machine just as quickly as using both brakes. Nevertheless, you should always apply the rear brake, and slightly in advance of the front brake, so that a slight skid at the rear will warn you if you get close to the hazard point at which the bike may tip."
When or how often should I replace my bike helmet?,"Helmets should be replaced roughly every 5 years and after any crash where your head makes contact with the ground. Helmets will crumble, compress or otherwise deform in sometimes hard to see ways when you hit the deck. The structural integrity of the thing will be massively diminished after even a relatively tame fall. This is one area where you don't want to mess around much."
Can I ride home with a broken spoke?,"Yes you can ride home with a broken spoke. I'd probably unscrew the spoke from the nipple before doing so, so that it doesn't wobble around and get caught in other bits of the bike. Bike wheels are wonderful things that can easily put up with having a few spokes missing."
"What's the difference between All-Mountain, Cross Country, Freeride, Downhill bikes?","The following list contains the basic characteristics and differences for the aforementioned types of MTBs plus 2 types of bikes that you didn't mention. Note that I've tried to summarise and ""average"" the characteristics of modern MTBs used today by amateurs and pros. So 9 kgs for XC bikes means that you can easily find 8 and 11 kg ones. Cross country (XC) bikes: All mountain (AM) bikes: Freeride bikes (FR): Downhill bikes (DH): Dirt Jump bikes (DJ): Slope style bikes (SS):"
Periodic Maintenance Task for Bike Commuters,My bike service guys wrote a blog article along these lines. You may find it useful.  The article recommends four principals for basic bike care. These are
Hydraulic Vs. Mechanical disc brakes,"Hydraulics are used on higher end systems, cables are often a sign of a cheap brake set, so your observations are correct regarding ""professional"" bikes. However there are very good cable disc brakes (e.g. Avid BB7's) that are the exception that proves the rule. .  Cables have the disadvantage of friction that hydraulics virtually eliminate. It is significantly easier to modulate hydraulic brakes, you get more force delivered to the pads, hence more stopping power for the same input, and faster/more reliable and predictable pad retraction when releasing the brakes. 
As the Hydraulic system is sealed, grit and grime cannot get in to jam up the moving bits, making them virtually maintenance free (replace worn pads is about all need doing)
Hydraulic systems are also easier to set up and adjust (with the right tools - next to impossible without them). Cables have to the exact length, and need ""tweaking"" as they stretch from new.   That said - a good quality and well maintained cable system will out perform a poor quality, cheap hydraulic brake set, so you cannot state ""Its hydraulic therefore it's better"".   Disadvantages of hydraulics occur when you get a leak such as hole in a hose or blown seal. They are less ""field serviceable"" than cables, essentially the brake is rendered useless and unrepairable (in the field) by a minor fault - which fortunately happens very rarely, and usually caused by poor transport rather than while out riding.  Another reported problem with hydraulics is boiling of fluid. This is more of a problem on road bikes where mountain descents of 100's of vertical meters in a very short time are more common. With overheated fluid initially the pressure in the system stops the fluid boiling. When the brake is released (even for a moment), the pressure comes off and fluid boils, and the brakes no longer work - at all - the lever just goes all the way in. Another thing that can happen is the rider stops with no problems, but the heat in the calliper (no longer being cooled by airflow) migrates to the fluid over the next few minutes, so when the rider rides off there are no brakes.  (This is different to disc fade where the pads and disc overheat and brakes loss effectiveness slowly - both types suffer this equally.)  Watch out in the future for Hydraulic shifters.... Available now if you have the big $$$$, lighter weight than XT and XX level components, almost certainly more reliable and easier to setup.... (Update 2015- Electric shifters mean these will not become main stream.) "
How to store a bike outside and still avoid rapid decay?,"A small shed seems like the best option if you have space–some insulation inside the shed would help stop condensation.  A bike kept outside will rust given enough time, its gears, etc. will also not like being wet all the time.  Just as importantly, it is more likely to get stolen if it is just left outside, and I would always rather get on a dry bike than a wet/cold bike."
What is the best method to teach a young child to ride?,"My dad taught me, my two sisters, my neices and nephews the same basic way. On grass.  Get them on a two wheeler, no training wheels, but with helmet on, and start em up on the grass.  Find a field that is smooth (maybe a slight downhill to start on) and push them and let them go. Grass is harder to ride on, but soft enough to fall on without damage that will get Mommy mad.  "
Why don't cyclists wear all-encompassing motorcycle-style helmets?,"Some bicyclists do wear full-face helmets; in particular, downhill mountain bikers and BMXers will frequently wear full-face helmets, as the chance of a crash causing you to land on your face is greater. The problem with full-face helmets is that they're hotter; your head is great for getting rid of excess heat, and the full-face helmet helps trap more of that in. Motorcyclists aren't pedaling furiously, and don't need to lose as much heat; heat management is essential for bicycling. Furthermore, motorcycle accidents tend to happen at higher speeds. On a bike, you're pretty unlikely to wipe out at 60 MPH, while on a motorcycle, it's all too possible. Between the lower risk on a bike, the heat issues, and the extra cost of full-face helmets, for most people it's not worth it to wear the full face helmet on their bicycle. Any safety feature is a trade-off, between the costs of implementing the feature and the harm or damage that it prevents. When the cost of implementing the feature exceed the expected value of the feature in harm reduction (taking into account the likelihood of the particular form of accident happening, and how severe the damage is), then it doesn't make sense to use that feature. People all assign different values to certain types of harm or damage, and also have different risks based on how they ride and what their environment is like. For some people, wearing a full-face helmet may be worth the extra expense and heat, but most people don't find it's worth that trade-off. Sadly, for many of these decisions, we don't have enough information; there isn't very much conclusive real-world data on the efficacy of bike helmets, let alone different types of bike helmets."
What are the pros and cons of internal gears?,"The main advantages of hub gears over a 1xN derailleur system are reliability and being able to shift while stationary. Since there's no derailleur or chain tensioner it's easier to add a full chaincase which means chains last a lot longer and with mudguards added there are no dirty bits accessible on the bike. They're heavier and harder to maintain if you have to maintain them.  There's a whole style of bike that uses those advantages (and others) and from a US perspective is called a ""european"" or ""dutch"" bike. Broadly, it's a bike built for someone who is not a cyclist, rather they are someone who uses a bike for transport. It should just work, no special clothes or rituals required. Compared to a 3xN derailleur system a hub gear is much simpler to operate and maintain. All the gears are in order and you only have one shifter. The compromise is a smaller gear range (Rohloff being the obvious exception), ranging from a little smaller for the Shimano Alfine 11 down to ""yes, there are two gears"" for the back-pedal-shift 2 speed hubs. But in return you get extremely long life for the chain and cogs (10,000km or more for the chain, 20,000km+ for cogs) and a general low-fuss maintenance requirement. That also makes it practical to put a hub gear in places where derailleur gears could go but you wouldn't want them - under my load carrying quad, for instance, where the derailleur hung down between the rear wheels just waiting for a rock to break it off, and turning the thing over for maintenance is a pain. Removing the rear wheel on a hub geared bike ranges from nigh on impossible (some of the Shimano hubs, and some dutch bikes have chain cases that are just irritating to work on) to almost trivial (a Rohloff with QR). The problem is the shifter cable - you have to detach it to remove the wheel. Good ones just unhook, poor ones you have to undo the adjuster barrel and re-adjust the gears on reassembly. Shimano are getting better, but Rohloff and Sturmey Archer have it down pat. Servicing hubs is not often done these days. The manufacturers generally allow bike shops to swap out the internals for new, saving the hassle of building a new wheel, but that's about it. I had three Shimano Nexus 8 hubs fail at 5,000km intervals, and every time I just got replacement internals rather than the hub being repaired (the last time, of course, Shimano had stopped making the hub so I had to throw away the wheel). With Rohloff the same thing might happen, except after 150,000km or more... most people don't ride that far in a lifetime. Also, with Rohloff you change the oil every 5,000-10,000km, at a cost of half an hour of your time and about $20 for an oil change kit (or $10 for just the oil). I usually run a Schwalbe Marathon Plus on the rear of my hub geared bikes, which trades a little extra rolling resistance for huge puncture resistance. It's part of the ""my bike just works"" philosophy. I'd rather reliably take an extra 30s to get to work than at random intervals be 5-10 minutes late and dirty due to a puncture (because you know that you'll only get punctures when you're in a hurry and it's raining)."
Is listening to music dangerous while cycling? [closed],"It is worth noting that deaf people cycle perfectly well. @Joe's excellent comment merit's adding into the answer...
Edit It should also be noted that deaf people are used to being deaf. They never rely on sounds like hearing-abled people do.  Its OK to listen to music as long as  That said, I don't listen to music while cycling. "
What are the effects of completely filling tires with water instead of air?,"I happened to do just that. I took an old hand pump and an inner tube to the bath tub.  Submerged the pump and pre-filled the tube with water, complete with burping out any air bubbles.  With the tube moderately full and free from air, I put it on the rim with the tire.  Then the final pressure up. The first thing to notice is that the pump operates with lots of resistance (water flows a lot slower than air through those tiny parts).   As I pushed each stroke of the pump, the resistance difficult yet constant.  I kind of expected the resistance to increase as I pressured up the tire, but it didn't.  It was a solid stopping point, halfway through the last stroke the tire wouldn't take any more water. (I shouldn't have been surprised, water is one of the least compressible substances around!) Now out for a ride to test this out! Indeed to carry the bike the front was a bit heavier (heavier is exactly what most cyclists would not want; but hey, lets see if there's some benefits). Oddly, the bike didn't feel all that different.  Just slightly front heavy.  But once I got some speed the steering became really quite stable.  A ride through the forest and I could quickly pin point my leans for corners, it was soooo smooth!  Like the steering of a motorbike; I assume the extra rotational inertia in the front wheel added to the smoothing gyroscopic effect. Mucking about, I tried a wheelie.  It took a bit of getting used to for lifting it up, but once up it was also very very smooth.  I was never that good an wheelies, but now I seemed to be able to ride for as long as I wanted.  Try balancing a baseball bat with the heavy side down, it's actually much easier with more weight at the top!  And the extra gyroscopic effect made it easier to steer the wheelie. When stopped at a light or something, pick up the front tire and it would slowly start to rotate on it's own.   It was fun, so I kept it. The next phenomenon was a puncture.  sure enough, one day riding on a nice sunny day... I feel tiny sprinkles of water; I had a tiny tiny leak and I was actually spraying a very fine stream.  The tire hadn't lost much though, so I double timed it to my destination in hopes of avoiding changing in the field.  On arrival, the tire seemed really quite full still.  When off the bike the tire really wasn't getting flat. I left it.  I continued to ride for a week or so, sometimes the leak would come back... sometimes it would go away.   I'm speculating, as I only did this once... but it occurred to me that with water being incompressible, the small amount of leaking water was very little volume but nearly all of the pressure.  The tire was still full and held it's shape, but no pressure to force the leak when I wasn't on it (it was obviously a very small leak).  Eventually I had to add some air, now and again (too lazy to put water in, and too curious to see how bad the water/air mix would be).  Soon the water/air mix was sloshing inside and causing a lot of resistance, and that became the end of my experiment. In the end I did not see any improvement for hill climbs, or maintaining pedal momentum; only wheelies and cornering."
How can I make my bike (and myself) visible at night?,The obvious few things are:
What is a reasonable speed for long distances on a bike?,"Speed varies widely by cyclist, depending on fitness, road conditions and traffic.  Some of my observations (cruising speed based on a flat, paved road in good condition): (based on who I pass and who passes me when riding around 30km/h) Average speed will usually be slower than you think, once traffic stops and hills are factored in, especially over longer distances (like 80km).  On my 21km commute I'll hit 30+ on every long stretch I can, but my average still only works out to 24km/h.  For longer rides I cruise around 27-28 km/h, which is more sustainable; averaging 22-24 over a very long ride (200km) is a great pace for me."
How to prevent drafting?,"In road racing there are lots of way to try and gain an advantage (or not to give others an advantage).  Because this is a friendly race, I will break it down into friendly, indifferent and hostile tactics.  Update 1:
The OP updated their question to make it clear that they were a beginner and the other rider was a more experienced road rider. So I have added a paragraph at the bottom discussing the importance of how a tactic or strategy is executed.  Update 2:
A fun video:  How To Get Rid Of Wheelsuckers These tactics are intended to keep the competition friendly by letting your friend draft, but with the intent of making a decisive move at some point to win, which will clearly demonstrate that you were the stronger rider on the day. These tactics are a little more aggressive than (1) and may be fair game depending on your friendship and views on competitive behaviour. Depending on how much you value your friendship (e.g., frenemies), there are also some hostile techniques that I have come across in races over the years.  I document them for completeness sake to indicate what should generally not consider as a strategy. WARNING: In no way should the ""forcing an error"" tactics be used against your friend as these tactics can potentially send someone to the hospital. The tactics and strategy outlined above will rely heavily on execution, which can be difficult for beginners.  Many new riders will only partially commit to a tactic, holding back for fear that it might not work out. The ""secret"" is that once you decide on a tactic you really have to commit everything to it (i.e., willingness lose and look like a fool). Otherwise it is only a half strength attack which is easier for the other rider to survive. The more experienced rider will be practiced in the determination needed to knuckle down and survive an attack (even though they may be less fit overall).  This mental strength and experience can make them a formidable opponent if you do not fully commit to a strategy or tactic. It can take time and practice for beginners to develop the ""killer"" instinct needed for success, so don't get discouraged if a chosen strategy doesn't work first time out. Sometimes you just have to keep throwing mud at the wall to get some to stick."
Can you be ticketed for breaking the speed limit on a bike?,"I believe it depends upon the jurisdiction. In the UK you are not assumed to know the speed you are doing (even if you have a speedometer) and so cannot be convicted of speeding. However, you may be committing other offences. In England and Wales, a ""person who rides or drives furiously any horse or carriage, or drives furiously any cattle"" is committing an offence under the 1847 Town Police Clauses Act. Infamously, a cyclist was convicted of this in 1997 (for going 25 mph in what was technically though unrealistically a 30 mph area). As far as I am aware, that case is unique."
What is the practical advantage of disk brakes over rim brakes?,"Working backwards from how it works: Not using the rim means the brake is unaffected by how straight the rim is, and heating the rotor doesn't affect the tyre. The rim is not worn away by braking and the rotor material can be selected entirely for its suitability for that one purpose. This also allows smaller clearance between pads and rotor, allowing: Increased pressure between brake pad and rotor compared to rim brakes means disks are less affected by water or other contaminants. Pads can be made of harder material giving increased pad lifetime. Having the brake caliper further away from the tyre means it's less affected by mud, and it can be made partly or fully enclosed to further sheild it. The rotor is also less likely to  hit obstacles as it's further from the ground. Being a hub brake makes unconventional designs possible. Single sided wheel mounts are the most obvious example, but some suspension systems are incompatible with rim brakes, and building a rim braked carbon composite wheel is much harder than building one to use a hub brake. Disk brakes can also be fitted to both sides of a wheel for increased heat dissipation, and it's easier to vary the design for different characteristics (weight, heat capacity, modulation etc). Doing that with a rim brake means the brake manufacturer has to start selling wheels as well. These combine to make disk brakes more reliable and easier to maintain.It's also somewhat easier to remove and reinstall wheels as you don't have to release the brake first."
How do you operate a used bike business without contributing to theft?,"There's a local bike shop that has exactly this model.  They buy bikes from walk-ins. They recently got charged for receiving stolen goods from one guy who turned out to be a convicted burglar, who would bring in a bike a week to sell, but always tried to talk to different staff, and each only saw him once every month or two. So defence against this could include any of: Requiring proof of purchase, seller has to have original paperwork Seller has to ""seem plausible""  ie a dad with a 10 year old in tow, selling a 5 year old's bike looks legitimate, but an obviously overweight man selling a fancy carbon road bike claiming ""I don't ride it anymore"" is less plausible. When buying a bike take a photo of the person who brought it in, and store that.  Also ask for a photo ID and get a photo of that too.  Tell the seller that this info will be kept and shared amongst all staff and.... Build relationships with other shops in the same business.  Share that buyer info (securely) but prevent someone doing a honeybee from shop to shop. Buy on consignment, not for cold cash.  So you take the bike, get info, and give a receipt.  Once the bike sells only then does the seller get their payment.  That way if it turns out to be stolen, the seller gets no money for it and the shop has not ""traded in stolen goods"" Build a working relationship with the local police, especially those officers/staff working in the burglary/theft departments. Set up the shop so the sellers have to bring the bike to the back, in past several cameras that are recording. All this will work to limit the number of bikes that are brought in.  Expand that by: Train one's staff to smell a problem - if the seller doesn't know a drop bar from a drop bear and their bike is a racey bike then enact more limits and restrictions.  Once you know someone, make it easier for them. Ultimately there will be mistakes, but the shop is in the clear if they've worked hard to limit the risk.  And ideally helped the Po with catching some idiots. Interestingly, here's the real-world: Newspaper story from the time  https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/115199174/judge-calls-on-police-to-investigate-bike-shop-that-bought-seven-stolen-bikes"
What type of tires can prevent goatheads?,"I switched to using Specialized Armadillo a while ago because of frequent punctures, and I haven't had any since making the switch. I'd highly recommend them."
Why are higher-end freewheels so much louder when coasting?,"Most of the noise comes from pawls on the freewheel hitting against the splines on the engagment surfaces which makes up the racheting unit. Some reasons for the noise between freewheels?
Tension on pawls could be higher causing more noise as they glide over the engagment surfaces High end freewheels have more pawls and engagement points than lower end freewheels, so there are more ridges in the engagement surface and more pawls hitting the splines on the engagement surface. The reason this is desirable is that more pawls and engagement points means faster engagement when you start pedaling. Different grease (or less grease) could also be used inside higher end freewheels that is less viscous and provides less resistance, allowing the spring action of the pawls to cause more noise as they float over the the splines on the engagement surface since they are less restricted by the grease. Of course there are exceptions to these.  Some hubs don't use your standard racheting mechanism and use a 'roller clutch' instead. The roller clutches tend to be very quiet, but are more prone to failure.Here's a good description of how those work.  http://pardo.net/bike/pic/mobi/d.winners-hub/index.html"
Protocol for downhill cyclist overtaking a car?,"Please accept my apologies on behalf of cyclists. Hollerin' something at a motorist who was trying to figure out how to handle an obviously unclear situation was inappropriate. Thanks for doing your best and not killing any cyclists that day! In general, I agree with the other answers here that you handled this fine and there isn't some magic you could have worked to make the situation go away. Having frequently cycled one of the curviest and steepest highways in the US, I have often been in the position of your cyclist. I also know from a drivers perspective of the same road that there are not a whole lot of obvious moves. The primarily impetus for any action should probably be on the cyclist. As a motorist being aware helps a lot; but don't try to do anything fancy. Keep it simple. Watch for what kind of move the cyclist wants to make and adapt, but be consistent yourself. He's trying to guess how your car is going to behave -- if you change patterns on him, all bets are off. The easiest place for a cyclist to pass is usually the place where cars naturally go the slowest. This means curves. Straights are hard because cars speed up (and try to pass each other). While we do have to follow the rules of the road, passing on a double yellow curve is sometimes the safest thing to do on a bike. Inside curves (left turns for US folks) provide the most visibility and a chance to cut a shorter path than the car. The best thing you can do is stay all the way in your lane and take the curve easy. Let the cyclist make the move. You don't have to be in the shoulder or pulled over or anything, just keep your own company and don't wander all over the road yourself. It's ok to brake. Cyclists have brakes too and there is no physical reason we are forced go fast or follow close. If you want to be extra nice, when you do brake, touch the brakes lightly at first so your brake lights come on early and gradually add pressure to slow the car. In fact, if a cyclist is following you too closely and you are uncomfortable, tap the brakes a couple times to signal you need room to brake. You don't have to actually brake, but the brake lights are the best signal you can give to indicate you want the cyclist to add some distance. Turn signals are confusing, but usually a right from you means you are going to pull over and a left means you can see the road is clear to pass. However, these are not set and stone and the cyclist still needs to make a judgement call. Hazard lights are even more confusing: I would save them for indicating true hazards. To make a long story short, drive normally and safely yourself, and let the cyclist take care of the passing."
Homemade bicycle degreaser liquids,"I am an industrial chemist, and manufacture commercial-grade degreasers and other cleaners. Firstly, there are 3 main parts to a degreaser: (there are also other components in professional degreasers, such as water softeners, hydro-tropes, anionic and ionic surfactants, specific application solvents, etc...) The main source of the above 3 parts can be from using baking soda as a alkaline booster, methylated spirit as a solvent (I would use methylated spirit because it is water-soluble), and a small amount of dish-washing liquid as a surfactant. An example formulation by volume would be: The methylated spirit and the sodium bicarbonate will work together to extract and lift the dirt/grime/grease, and the dish-washing liquid will work as a surfactant to stop it from depositing back on the bike again. The dish washing liquid will also act as a wetting agent and a foam booster. EDIT ---- Please also note, that the methylated spirit will prevent (or nearly prevent) any foam or the like from forming. If you want foam, you will have to substitute the methylated spirits with a mild solvent that is hydrophilic and not oil-based (lipophilic)."
How to get a very tight tire back on the rim?,"

 The above video shows how to fit a tight tire / rim combination. Although it shows the Marathon Plus tire, it applies to any tire. The crucial point he makes on the video is that the tire bead doesn't stretch and is the limiting factor in getting the tire on. Thus you need to push the bead into the well of the rim on the sides opposite to the last bit you're trying to get on. Doing this gives you the room you need to get the last bit on.
The extra room will make it easier and you will be less likely to pinch the tube. You can use straps to hold the tire in place if you need to. I have the Marathon Plus tires and it used to take me an hour of frustration and sore hands trying to get them on. Using the technique in the video it takes me 5 mins like any other tire."
What is the difference between brake cables and derailleur cables?,"Cables: The main difference that I am aware of is the diameter of the cable. Most brake cables are 1.5 or 1.6mm in diameter. Most shift cables are 1.1 or 1.2mm, galvanized shifter cables are 1.3mm. I'm sure that there is a lot of science behind the difference but I'll leave that to someone else. One major difference in MTB vs road BRAKE cable is the different sizes and styles of head: road cables have mushroom like ends where as MTB brake cables have barrel like ends. Shifter cable ends are the same. Although nowadays many cables come with both ends, one on each end, and you can cut off the one you're not using. There are two basic types of cables; brake and shifter.  Brake cables are thicker, typically 1.5/1.6mm in diameter.  Brake cables come with a choice of three different heads - one for mountain/flat bar brake levers, one for Shimano road/drop bar brake levers (compatible with most non-Shimano levers), and one for Campagnolo road/drop bar brake levers.  A Shimano cable head is slightly larger than a Campy head so it may not fit into a Campy road brake.  A.  Shimano Brake Cable 
B.  Campagnolo Brake Cable 
C.  MountainBrake Cable 
D.  Shimano Shifter Cable 
E.  Campagnolo Shifter Cable  Derailleur cables are thinner, 1.1/1.2mm in diameter.  There are two
heads available on derailleur cables - Shimano and Campagnolo.  A
Shimano cable head is slightly larger than a Campy head so it may not
fit into a Campy shifter. From Bikeman Housing: Just like with cables, housing comes in two different types: brake and shifter.  From the outside they may look the same - but they are in fact very different. Brake housing is built around a wire that coils down the length of the cable.  This structure gives the great strength needed for the power generated by the brake lever.  Shifter cables see different forces so the housing is built differently.  Shifter housing is built around many length-wise running cables that make the housing 'compressionless' which aids in the crisp feel of shifting - especially needed on today's 8/9/10/11 speed cassettes.  Shifter housing also comes in two different outside diameters, 4mm and 5mm.  New bikes and shifter sets typically come with 4mm housing.  Most 4mm housing will have plastic ferrules at the ends while 5mm housing uses metal ferrules.  Here at Bikeman we recommend using 5mm shift housing. Other variations of housing include housing made from many aluminum segments, like Nokon housing.  On the positive side the aluminum housing is stiff, lightweight, and reusable.  On the negative side there is a lot more set up time, cost, and care must be taken to be sure that the frame is protected as aluminum housing will rub paint off where it contacts the frame. Please Note: Due to their construction, brake housing should always be used with brakes and shifter housing should always be used with shifters.  Shifter housing could fail if used on a brake (not good when you want to stop), brake housing could make that shifter feel a little dead."
How to get over anger at inconsiderate drivers,"After 50+ years as a cyclist, this is my approach - ride according to the conditions ride in reasonable proximity to the curb if safe, move over a little as traffic approaches know where I'm going, and do it assertively if somebody honks / shouts / waves, assume that they must be a friend, or are telling me something important, so smile broadly and wave enthusiastically in return"
How to commute to work on your bike and dress up,"I've recently started commuting to work 3 times a week and my commute is about 8 miles each way. I've found if I roll my clothes rather than fold them and pack just before I leave, there are no creases when I get to work. I always put my shoes at the bottom of my bag, then trousers rolled up then shirt. I leave my ties in my desk draw and leave my suit jacket at work. It takes me about 45 minutes to get to work and I make sure I take the last mile easy so I don't arrive out of breath. I then spend about 10 minutes in my cycling clothes (making sure the kettle is boiled and quickly checking emails) to give me time to ""cool down"" before I go and get changed in to my work clothes. I've found I'm completely ""dry"" by then but if not I use wet wipes. Liberal use of deodorant and I'm good to go. On the way home I just do the reverse. I attack the route home faster for a work out as I can have a shower when I get home. I believe that as you get fitter you'll sweat less too, so it gets easier."
Safest way to slow down a bike quickly if both sets of brakes fail,"BMXers in some places put the shoe between rear tire and frame, just where the rear brake normally is attached to the bike. I've never done that, because I used to run knobby tires (ouch!), and nowadays I care a lot about brakes. You really should avoid this situation, because many times there would not be much to do. I would guess, a good alternative would be to turn sharply while leaning the bike, and then skidding the rear tire sideways. That is already difficult to do in a planned way, what to say when you are frightened... A good thing to do is follow the advice ""brake early, brake often"", so you don't have to find out your brakes are not working only when is already too late."
What is the proper etiquette for overtaking a horse?,"Passing a horse, mounted or otherwise, should be done so: It all depends on the horses' temperament.  Some are OK, some like cars but not bicycles...
Generally, horses with kids/teenagers riding them on the road will be pretty laid back.  The horses that are being led by someone are much more suspect.   Competent equestrian owners/staff know that any horse [that will be taken or ridden on roads] needs to be exposed very carefully (for the safety of the horse, the rider, and the general public).  They have to accept that the horse may never be comfortable in that setting.  But anything could spook the most experienced horse - you never know 100%. If possible, send a single person ahead to talk to who has control of the horse while watching how the horse reacts.  "
Are mountain bikes good for urban riding?,"For the past few years, I have commuted on a road bike for most of the year and on a mountain bike for late fall through early spring. My commute also involves both classic road-riding and more urban-style riding. What I've Found I've found that I prefer the road bike by a significant degree. Living in a hilly area, it is always a pleasure to drop the excess weight of the shock system, the efficiency loss due to bouncing and flexing, and the wide tired of my mountain bike come spring. I can finally take my backpack off and put on panniers, which keeps my back from getting as sweaty and is generally more comfortable. My fenders work better to keep the mud off me. It is an altogether more enjoyable experience. If I could ride my road bike in the winter, I would. Hard to do in the snow, unfortunately, especially when it comes to the turning bit. What I Lose However, when I switch to the road bike, I feel I lose some peace of mind. On my road bike, whenever I see a patch of sand at a corner I've got to take, whenever I ride in the rain over fallen leaves, I worry that I will lose traction and fall. Furthermore, I've been run off the road before and gotten close to it several times and I feel much safer and more comfortable on my mountain bike knowing I can ditch the road and jump into the rough easily if necessary. On my mountain bike, I don't fear to hop up or down the curb to, for example, avoid a runner in traffic. I can take shortcuts over uneven terrain, hop a few stairs, and be on my way. Conclusion In conclusion, I recommend finding a bike that fits your specific needs. If you can only have one bike, find the bike that allows you to do everything. If you live somewhere that gets significant snow, if you live in a place with terrible roads and worse drivers, you may need that mountain bike. If you live in a city with as many shortcuts and stairs as potholes, you'll love the ""Go Anywhere"" ability. If you live in a very hilly environment, you'll love the climbing gear on your MB. If you have any interest in actually mountain biking, keep in mind that a mountain bike can do both while a road bike has to stay out of the trails. If you live in a more suburban area, or somewhere as flat as Kansas or The Netherlands, or if you live somewhere with nice weather year round, a road bike is the way to go. The ride quality will be higher; you will feel light as a feather, fast as a Ferrari, and much more efficient than on your MB. TL;DR:"
What are advantages and disadvantages of CO2 inflators over frame pumps?,"Advantages: Disadvantages: One possibility to consider is a combo unit.  Generally the pump on those is terrible, but it should be enough to get you home if you run out of CO2.  Or carry both a pump and a CO2 valve and a cartridge.  That way your first flat can be fixed super-fast and you avoid all the disadvantages (and the weight of a simple valve and one cartridge isn't much)."
How are the categories for climbs decided?,"As has been mentioned, the actual categories are fairly subjective. Things such as the fame of a climb as well as how the organizers feel about giving out King of the Mountain points on a given stage will affect rankings.  That said, there are some general rules of thumb if you want to get an idea of how your local climb rates up to a given ranked climb in the tour though. There are always exceptions to climb rankings, but this should give you a basic list to start with. As I mentioned though, you can find exceptions for any of these. Some examples would include:"

Is it really going to damage a bike to wash it with a hose?,"Yes, pressurized water can damage your bicycle, specifically by washing the grease out of bearing areas. Note, this is pressurized water. Using a garden hose without a sprayer is unlikely to do damage. Using a garden hose with a shower type sprayer is unlikely to cause damage. Low pressure, so that it doesn't break the seals, is the point. (I avoid the risk, anyway, because I can't afford to be wrong, and how much pressure is OK depends on the strength of the seals on your particular bike.) A car wash, or any other pressure washer, is pretty much guaranteed to do damage. Washing by hand, with a bucket, a car wash brush, a toothbrush or gear brush, and some non-detergent based soap is the safest way, and with a little practice and preparation, can be done in half an hour. Some detergent based soaps react to aluminum, and can cause serious damage to an aluminum frame or parts over time. Make sure you use an aluminum safe soap. You can make things easier by using a repair stand to hold the bike, and removing some parts, if you have the tools and knowledge, but that's a bonus. Other than that, it's just elbow grease."
Why do bikes have their drivetrains on the right?,"Because (most) people are right handed. Right side drivetrains are rooted in the fact that rotating clockwise causes bolts, etc. to tighten—this dates back to the first ""safety bicycles"" introduced in the 19th century. With the drivetrain on the right, more (standard threaded) parts will be rotating clockwise and thus tightening themselves as the rider pedals.  Drivetrains are on the right today because that's what bicycle builders decided to do in the late 1800s. As to why they originally decided to put drivetrains on the right, it's probably because rear cogs used to be screwed on (some still are). Standard threads dictate rear cogs be on the right, so that pedaling force tightens the cogs. (If they were on the left, pedaling force would likely loosen cogs.) Today, left-hand drivetrains are possible, but more difficult to create because more reverse-threaded parts are needed. Generally, things like pedals and bottom brackets have threads that are reversed/asymmetric on one side. They're made specifically to work when the drivetrain is on the right—tightening themselves as the rider pedals. If these standard parts are placed on a bicycle with a drivetrain on the left, then those same parts will be loosening themselves as the rider rides.  But why do right-turning bolts tighten? Shortly before the safety bicycle was introduced in the 19th century, the right-turning convention was adopted because it's better to have all bolts work the same way and it's easier to turn them with your right hand. And most people are right handed. "
Does a helmet-mounted light affect the safe functionality of the helmet?,"I found something on the homepage of the Bicycle Helmet Safety Institute. They have an article about bicycle helmet lights, listing the pros and cons of them: Summary: Lights on bicycle helmets can be useful, but must have a breakaway mount. Especially about the breakaway mount: The importance of breakaway mounts The first and most important rule for mounting a light on your helmet is that it must break away readily when you crash or catch an overhanging obstacle. If it does not, you risk having your neck jerked when it snags on the pavement or tree. Besides jerking your neck, that can add to the g's of the shock to your brain when you hit pavement. Although there are no studies mentioned how dangerous it is when the light does not fall off during a crash, some manufacturers test their lights to break away during a crash: Only one helmet manufacturer we have spoken to provided their lab test levels, Uvex, proving that they actually have an internal standard. And the light manufacturer Jet Lites has a standard requiring their mount to break away when loaded with a 5 pound weight. This shows that it is important that the light falls off during a crash, but unfortunately most manufacturers do not care. Which seems to be a problem: Some manufacturers use hook-and-loop straps to hold their lights on. We have seen some that wrap through the vents and under that seemed unlikely to detach when they should have. But again, there is no standard for that. Source: http://www.bhsi.org/helmetlights.htm"
How can I make it clear to other road users that I'm an inexperienced cyclist?,"This is an interesting and thoughtful question, and just the fact that you are thinking carefully about how other road users think about you is very valuable and will contribute to your safety on the road. Your question makes a lot of sense. How do you indicate to drivers that you need and deserve their consideration and patience, especially when you have doubts about your own skill on the bike and the road right now? Unfortunately, I am not sure that being seen as inexperienced will result in drivers being more considerate. I think it is likely to have the opposite effect. Just look how impatient and inconsiderate drivers can be when dealing with a learner driver who holds them up or inconveniences them. Even children, unfortunately, don't in my experience get treated with more patience or consideration. My warning would be that making your inexperience clear to other drivers is likely to have negative results. Instead, I believe that the key things are to be: One of the best things I've read to help think about this is David Martin's Theory of Big. I won't repeat its points here, but I think it's well worth reading. Regarding those points above: Are you brightly lit, visible, do you stand out, catch eyes? Do you ride in a visible position, make clear, large signals? How do you dress, and move? Mostly, these are easy things to do. Riding in a visible position needs confidence though; that's not always so easy. It's not enough merely to be noticed. You want to take up some space in the thoughts of drivers. What can you do to achieve this? Unfortunately, once again it often does take some confidence to ride in a way that helps you get thought about. For example, on a road that I know has pot-holes or gravel in awkward places, I will ostentatiously signal and move widely around them; this can help a driver think ""oh, this person moves around and does stuff"" (not: ""I can slip by this cyclist without a moment's thought or without leaving much room""). If you need to signal, signal in big, clear, impossible-to-miss ways that look like they express meaning. What you signal are your intentions. The physical act of signalling will get you noticed, but the expression of your intention is what will get you thought about. More: at a traffic light on a busy road, if I am stopped in front of a car, I might pretend to fiddle with a brake or pedal or gear, or tug at the strap of a pannier, just to occupy some attention of a driver while we wait for the lights to change (when? sometimes I just get a feeling that this might be a useful thing to do). Or, if I spot an on-coming car on a narrow country lane, I will make sure to move clearly across the line of sight of the oncoming driver before slipping in to the side of the road to make room. I don't disappear into a hedge before the driver has seen me. Generally, you want to ride in ways that are cautious and predictable but without appearing to be too predictable. If a driver is sure that they know what you will do, that can be very dangerous. Better that they are never entirely sure what you will do, so that they stay alert for what you actually do. I try to look as though I might do something that needs them to respond to appropriately. I want them to imagine that the wheels might suddenly fall off my bike, that my bags might burst open strewing shopping in their path, that I might suddenly stop to admire a flower or greet a friend. It's important to note: I am absolutely not recommending foolish or dangerous behaviour. Weaving around unnecessarily around other road users is dangerous. Doing unpredictable things is dangerous. Riding on unreliable equipment can be dangerous. Actually having a loose bag is dangerous. There are two more important ways that help you get thought about. They are to: Eye-contact is valuable. You exchange a lot of information - for example, you can communicate an intention - but you also simply place yourself in another's thoughts by it. Sometimes, the opposite is called for. If a driver thinks you haven't seen them, they will be thinking about you and wondering what you will do. That's exactly what you want. So sometimes, I studiously avoid catching a driver's eye. Which of these two techniques you adopt in any particular case will depend on the precise circumstances; I'm not sure I could formulate a clear rule. Both require and demonstrate a kind of confidence. But either way, you don't want to appear as an uncertain, diffident road-user whose intentions and future actions are of no consequence and don't need to be thought about. Finally, you need to be respected. There are two senses to being respected: People, mostly, will recognise and respect another's humanity. Show that you are a human being, a being like them, to whom they have a duty of care. The acts described earlier that help you get thought about flow directly into this. Now, as well as being thought about as a road user or as another vehicle on the road, you want to take another step, to be thought about as a human being. So do human things, and look human. I might take my hat off (I don't bother wearing a helmet, but it's not a discussion I'm much interested in having) and scratch my head on a long downhill stretch. ""Oh,"" thinks the driver, recognising that I am a person just like them, ""that person has an itch."" Or I will tuck my top in, or pull it out. I might blow my nose at the traffic lights. Something that shows that I have a human body will never be to my disadvantage. I'm not suggesting to make your bike rides into an unrelenting pantomime of extravagant gestures and unnecessary actions. You don't need to put on any kind of absurd performance (which in itself would be dangerous). It's rather that what you do, when you do it and who you do it in front of makes a difference, so you need to think about it, and use it to your advantage. As well as automatically deserving respect as a human being, which you'd hope would be recognised by all, it also helps to earn respect. Maybe this shouldn't be necessary, but unfortunately, it often is. Ride politely and considerately. Obey the rules of the road, and make a point of doing so. Stop at lights. Courteously invite motorists to pull out or pass when it's safe to do so. If a driver makes way for you, make it clear that you thank them. Don't just wait to notice it, try to catch drivers in the act of being considerate so that you can acknowledge it. Finally, people often respect people who behave as though they deserve respect. That is a good way to ride: confidently, as though you belong on the roads, as though you expect their consideration and respect. Diffidence and uncertainty will unfortunately lose you that respect from some drivers. Act confidently - such as making signals and decisions - even when you don't feel like it, or at least, as much as you can. This is why I think that advertising your inexperience can do you more harm than good. It's really hard to do many of the things that I have advocated above. They take confidence, and experience, and practice. Many of them involve demonstrating your vulnerability as a road user, but not your weakness. I hope this helps, and I hope it helps think about how you need to appear in the eyes of other road users. I wish I could offer more useful advice about how to do this, for a person who doesn't know already how to. In the meantime, I hope you enjoy your riding and acquire the confidence you're looking for."
Which way do I orient my bike tire's tread direction? and why?,The tires have more traction in some directions than in others. Your front wheel does most of the braking; your rear wheel does all of the propulsion.  Tires are oriented to give the most traction to the primary fore-and-aft forces.
Why don't brakes come with 'Safety Levers' any more?,"I believe there are multiple reasons that ""extension""/""dual-pull""/""safety""/""suicide"" levers aren't seen anymore:"
How long should a road tyre hold its pressure?,"Do yourself a huge favor, inflate them daily.  As they are high pressure and low volume they tend to lose air quicker than that of a tube that is low pressure and high volume (MTB).  With daily inflation checks you will vastly reduce the instances of pinch flats, which IMO are typically the result of too low pressure. Butyl tubes, the typical tube, retain their pressure better than their Latex counterpart but still ... check regularly. This touches on why your tyres leak down (solubility etc):
Is there a difference in having tires filled with CO₂ vs air? "
What's the real difference between cheap and expensive helmets?,"No, usually expensive helmets are lighter and more comfortable because have more ventilation. So, if you plan to ride for long hours it's better to buy the more expensive helmet that you can afford, otherwise - for short rides - a cheap helmet will do the job."
How can I tell which size chain my bike uses?,"If you are using a bike with a derailleur the number of cogs on the rear hub will determine the chain size you will need.  They are always 3/32"" chains. You can get a 5/6/7-speed, 8-speed, 9-speed, or 10-speed chains. If you can't find a chain that matches your cluster pick a chain for a larger number, for example if you have an eight-cog cluster you can use a eight, nine or ten-speed chain, but you shouldn't use a 6 or 7-speed chain. Internally geared hubs will have their own specification for the size chain they require, and single-speed, fixie, BMX bikes, and probably some older bikes use 1/8"" chains."
Is it possible to measure your sit bones at home?,"Copied this from a BikeRadar article: Of course the measure you really want is between the centres of your ischial tuberosities – the pointy lower parts of your pelvic bone on either side. Many bike dealers have a pad that you can sit on to measure this distance, but you can do it at home too. Take a piece of aluminium kitchen foil and place it on a carpeted stair. Sit on the foil, lean forward a bit to approximate your riding position, then lift your feet. This should leave a good impression of your rear in the foil, and you can measure between the two points of deepest impression to get your sit bone width. ‘Narrow’ sit bone width would be 100mm or less, medium 100-130mm, wide over 130mm. A saddle’s width is measured from edge to edge across the top, and Specialized recommends a 130mm saddle width for narrow, 143mm for medium and 155mm for wide. These ﬁgures should translate approximately across other ranges, with all other factors taken into account."
Are slick tires worth it for commuting?,"Yes, definitely -- if you're riding on mostly paved roads, switch to bald-ish tires. Rolling resistance is huge and equates directly to effort, though as you start going really fast it is dwarfed by air and gravity of course. Per the graph here:  However, one caution: road tires tend to be skinny, and you probably want fat-but-bald tires instead. If you go from a 35mm wide treaded tire to a 25mm bald tire, you will feel a lot more bumps. So in summary: bald, for sure, but don't sacrifice too much width/comfort in the process."
Why do men's bicycles have a top tube while women's bicycles don't?,"Frames designed for women do have that part - its called a top tube.    Historically women wore skirts, so a lower frame in the middle made it easier to mount and dismount, and was less likely to accidentally show an ankle. This picture shows a modern ""woman's frame"" with the top tube paralleling the downtube, and attaching to the seat tube lower down.  Positives:  Negatives: Another frame designed for with these positives is the Mixte frame, where the top tube is replaced by two separate tubes similar to chainstays and seatstays.  These pass around the seattube and terminate at the headtube and the rear dropout, increasing the stiffness of the bike.    They're still heavier than a normal Diamond Frame bike.  Here's a photo of a Peugot showing the twin tubes.  Finally - there's absolutely nothing wrong with a woman riding a DF bike frame.  The main differences now are about proportions, not whether the rider wears a skirt.  There are situations where a man fits a ""woman's frame"" better than a ""man's frame"" "
Can I use a Presta tube in a Schrader rim?,"As you mentioned, one of the primary differences between a Presta and Schrader valves are the diameters--with Schrader valves being slightly larger--and therefore the valve holes on bicycle rims are drilled to suit one size or another. Your foremost concern with using a Presta valve in a rim drilled for a Shrader valve shouldn't be 'movement' of the valve stem, as geoffc suggested, but rather a 'hernia' of the tube through the excess space at high pressure, leading to a blowout. Most mountain bike tires sit at a low pressure, therefore you will probably get away with it, however, there is a very inexpensive adapter, sometimes called a 'valve grommet', which is made out of rubber or metal and serves to make the valve hole small enough for a Presta valve to fit snugly. It will also not come loose under high pressure, unlike geoffc's 'old tire' solution."
"Best type of bike lock (materials, style, etc.)","Get the kryptonite fahgettaboutit - as small as possible.  Kryptonite 997986 18mm New York Fahgettaboudit U-Lock,Black Mini  Best lock out there. Because the shackle is 18mm thick, I don't think you could cut it with bolt cutters, so you would need a hydraulic jack -- but the opening is too small for a jack to get through -- that's the main reason to go for a smaller lock, so there is no room for the jack; or, a disc grinder to get thru it."
Alternatives to buying a repair stand?,"I can tell you from experience that your best option is to buy a repair stand. I worked in a shop for a number of years and thought there was no way I could use a consumer grade stand when I left.  I purchased park tool PRS-4W at cost before I left the shop and built my own stand from it. The consumer price is now $200 for that so that is obviously not dealing with your $ issue.  And even if it did, I have since purchased and use a consumer grade stand with less features to maintain 4 bikes of different size frames for 5 years now and it was well worth the $ spent.  It gets the job done.  Bite the bullet, get the stand you'll be glad you did."
How to achieve an always clean chain,When you clean and then lube your chain ALWAYS take a towel and wipe off the excess lube.  Just hold the towel on the chain and spin the crank backwards.  And as mentioned above use a strap around you pants leg.  A large rubber band works.  A timing chip strap worn in triathlons work... those velcro watch bands work...  lots of ways here. Your hands will always get grimy if you have to touch the chain. 
Why ride a single-speed bike?,"I ride a single-speed (as opposed to fixed gear) because I like to be able to coast down a hill without worrying about spinning out, or hitting a pot-hole while frantically trying to keep up with my pedals. Don't get me wrong, I love riding fixed-gear, but for where I live it's just a little impractical to not be able to coast. I ride a single-speed (as opposed to a geared bike) for multiple reasons. A: It's all I could afford. If you only have $600, you'll get a lot more bike with a single-speed than a geared bike.  Or rather, you'll get a lighter bike with better hubs/wheels/etc than for a $600 geared bike. Someday I'll have the money for a decent road bike (105/Rival or better) and will buy one. But for now, my single-speed is much lighter and sturdier than any $600 geared road bike I could have gotten. B: I enjoy the simplicity. Want to go faster? Pedal faster. C: I enjoy the workout. I live in Utah, where there are some pretty big hills/mountains. The only way to get to the top is to (as my dad used to say) hunker down and gut it out. There's something quite invigorating about knowing you conquered that hill with the power in your legs instead of the mechanical advantage of your gear ratio. D: Even on the freewheel side of my hub, my single-speed is quiet. No gears means that unless I'm coasting, my bike is nearly silent."
Is commuting 10 km on an empty stomach harmful?,"As far as I can tell, no. I've been riding 30 minutes or more every workday before breakfast for more than 10 years with no detectable ill effects. When I was riding an hour to work I'd sometimes have a small snack before riding, but only rarely. When I'm cycle touring I'll often ride for an hour before I have breakfast, as that wakes me up and gets me warm, then I can stop and eat somewhere pleasant (I usually stealth camp so I'm not always sleeping in a nice place to hang round during the day). But an hour isn't an unreasonable ride before breakfast. For me! What matters is being aware of your body. If you're feeling bad, stop and work out why. If you're hungover... what did you expect? But if you normally feel fine and one day your stomach hurts, or you feel weak, or something else changes, worry. Stop, work out what the problem is. Eat, drink, pee, whatever. It's the same as if your bike feels funny or starts making a weird noise. Normally I carry breakfast to work, so I have it with me if I need to stop and eat. I also have money, which is surprisingly useful for solving problems :) If I need to I can get a taxi to work, buy food, whatever. FWIW I was vegetarian for most of that time, of late I've gone back to eating meat every couple of weeks (I'm getting older and meat seems to help me maintain muscle mass). I don't know if being vegetarian helps, but it doesn't seem to hinder the ride before breakfast. (ok, I've been doing this for more than 15 years, possibly more than 20)"
About 20-30 people bike to where I work. What equipment/supplies should we have on hand?,"I'd maybe ask the cyclists themselves - maybe ask them to bring useful spares and have an amount of petty cash on hand to reimburse them. They might be able to bring in old lights (let's face it many of us always leap to the newest kit and have drawers full of old kit lying around).  The basic tool set should include tyre levers, an adjustable spanner/wrench or combination bike tool, Allan keys (hex wrench).  If you're prepared to keep things topped up with consumables as well, that would be great - but you'll be forever replacing the inner tubes, but while you might need a mix of sizes, starting just with a few 700x25c would work.  I'm not convinced about spare helmets - apart from the whole obligated helmet wearing debate - you might be opening yourself up for liability if someone got badly injured in an accident while wearing one of the loaner items.  Many lights these days are rechargeable themselves, either through USB or directly to mains, so making sure that there are charging sockets and a charged USB hub could be good, maybe a battery charger would encourage people to switch to that style of battery. "
How do on-road mountain bike speeds translate to road bike speeds?,"On my reasonably flat commute I average around 16 mph on my road bike, but your average speed is dependent on many different factors. A general rule of thumb is that if you are switching from a mountain bike with knobbies to a road bike you will be between 15-20% faster at the same watts/effort.  Typically that's only a change of 2-3 mph. I teach a bike commuting workshop, and one of the most common questions is whether to switch from a mountain bike to a road bike in order to increase speed.  Typically, I tell people to try three things first: If you do those three things the only real differences between a road bike and your mountain bike will be the weight (which matters a lot more when accelerating than it does when you are already rolling) and surface area resistance from riding in the drops.  But most road bikers don't spend much time in the drops. Finally, your weight and fitness make a huge difference.  I frequently pass road bike riders while on my commuter rigid frame mountain bike with high pressure slicks."
Are there any scientific studies proving the benefits of clipless pedal systems?,"The Pedaling Technique of Elite Endurance Cyclists: Changes With Increasing Workload at Constant Cadence was published in the International Journal of Sport Biometrics 7:29-53, 1991. However, it seems to come to the conclusion that they don't really make any difference as far as pedaling efficiency goes. ""...while torque during the upstroke did reduce the total positive work required during the downstroke, it did not contribute significantly to the external work done because 98.6% and 96.3% of the total work done at the low and high workloads, respectively, was done during the downstroke."" This is echoed in Physiological and biochemical determinants of elite
endurance cycling performance published in the Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise 23:93-107, 1991. There are numerous graphs showing that pedal force is only exerted between the top and bottom of the downstroke, represented by a very sharp parabola spiking at 90 degrees from vertical. That said, I think it's obvious to anyone who has ever done any particularly technical riding with and without clipless pedals that clipless pedals significantly improve the handling of a bicycle. A fact which is probably more difficult to verify through scientific studies."
Best ways to avoid getting hit by cars?,"As cyclists, we are vulnerable to any collision. A collision with a truck, bus, car, bicycle, pram, skateboard, rollerblader, pedestrian, dog, or even a domestic cat, will almost always cause a problem, if not an injury. Vehicle drivers are just people like us, except that they are in a comfortable safe box, maybe with crying kids in the back, and a have just dropped an ice-cream on their lap. You cannot expect them to be looking out for you all the time. So it's up to us to take 100% responsibility for our own safety. It doesn't help us if we were 100% in the right, but are 100% dead. So ... Choose where you ride. Avoid high speed and congested roads. Statistics show that the probability of a collision rises rapidly after the speed difference between two road users exceeds 20 kph (12 mph). So choose paths without vehicle traffic, or roads with lower speed traffic. See How does the risk of a cyclist colliding with a vehicle vary with the speed difference? D'oh! I originally left out Ride where other people ride, or ride with a buddy. Drivers are much more likely to notice multiple riders. And when there is more than one of you it's not so easy to justify squeezing past. Finally, those drivers who might be tempted to drive dangerously close are intimidated by the you having a witness. Avoid turns in the middle of congested intersections. If you feel in danger, then ride at the side of the road across the intersection, wait for the lights to change, then continue on the crossroad. In my town this is called a square turn, in other places it's called a hook turn. Keep reasonably close to the curb, about half a meter (yard) to one meter out. You need to ride in a straight line so that the vehicle drivers can predict your path, so ride where the road surface is at least adequate. In light traffic, move toward the curb a little as the vehicle approaches and then resume your position after the vehicle passes. In heavier traffic, just maintain your path. Some cyclists like to have a mirror to know what's happening behind them. Traffic behaviour can vary in different parts of the world, so take your local traffic conditions into consideration. In my town, the inner city traffic is congested but used to seeing cyclists. So if there is no bike lane, cyclists are generally able to mix with the traffic fairly safely when the bikes are moving faster than the cars. Wear brightly colored clothing. In some parts of the world, black is fashionable. Avoid it. One advantage of a lot of so-called Lycra is that most of it is brightly colored. Some people wear hi-visibility industrial safety tops. Always ride with lights turned on. If legal, then set them to flash mode. Choose lights that flash more than once per second. Slow flashing lights can be missed as drivers shift their attention quickly. Some places (Germany?) forbid flashing bike lights. And stay alert. Listen for traffic. Don't rely on them seeing you. In some situations, you need to take a whole lane, so that the drivers behind don't drive too close by trying to squeeze past when there is not enough room. You should only do this when the traffic is moving at a similar speed to you. And as mentioned by mjsqu in comments, keep away from parked cars to avoid doors. "
Is it considered rude to draft other random cyclists?,"There was a post on this subject on The Guardian Bike Blog. I think there are a couple of issues with drafting random cyclists: I think your best bet is to ask before drafting, then there's no problem."
Toddler bike seat vs. bike trailer?,"I've had both. A really nice trailer and a child bike seat -- where the child sits between the rider and the handlebar (like this WeeRide Kangaroo Child Bike Seat).  My daughter was ok with the trailer, but absolutely preferred the seat. I found with the seat in front of me, the weight didn't affect me almost at all, and if the bike was going to fall, I'd be in a much better position to protect my child (since she's directly in front of me). We used that for a long time and never ever had an issue (and let's face it, with the kid along for the ride, you're not likely to ever ride like a madman, right?) She's six years old, and still misses it (we stopped when she was about 3.5 yrs old--just getting too big!)"
What's the efficiency of hub gears compared to derailleurs?,"A lot depends on the rider and what you mean by efficiency. It is easy to keep a hub gear running well for years, but an unmaintained derailleur will become inefficient very quickly.  A hub gear allows the chain to be fully enclosed, for all but the most dedicated cyclist; an enclosed chain will be more efficient as it will be cleaner and better oiled. An enclose chain allows you to arrive at work, with clean cloths and no need to change, this can save lots of time.  Not having to spend time adjusting a derailleur or cleaning your chain also increase the efficiency of your life.
However it takes longer to remove the wheel if you have hub gears and an enclosed chain. Gear shifting efficiency. This is most important in cities with many traffic lights to stop at. With a derailleur, you must shift before you stop, or you'll be starting in a high gear. With an IGH, you can forget about shifting while you are braking, and just select the right gear for the next acceleration a second before you start pedaling. It's a huge difference for a commuter, irrelevant for a racer.  Personally I think on a road bike: (I also like hub brakes for the same reason)"
What do you wish someone had told you before your first commute?,"My suggestion would be: Scout and rehearse your route before you start.  This is really an exercise in two parts: Once your commute is established I'd suggest that fairly regularly you allow yourself a bit more time (much easier going home!) to explore alternative routes - especially for urban commuters. The most obvious routes are not always the best, you may find shortcuts that are faster or routes that are prettier or have less traffic or smoother surfaces or that you simply like better (or that are not really very different but allow you to vary your route from time to time ""just because"")."
Ride with someone who is less trained,"If Ken is training that hard, he should have rest days with easy rides. Barbie should join him on a rest day easy ride, preferably the day after the hardest ride he does all week. Ken should also realize that allowing Barbie to set the pace ensures that he will not be over training.  As heltonbiker has mentioned in his comment, this can also be done on the same day, e.g. Ken can train hard in the morning and ride with Barbie in the afternoon. If Ken really feels that he would like to go longer, he should do one 20km loop with Barbie and then a second by himself while Barbie gets on with the rest of her day."
How do I gear up a bike for winter riding?,"In the winter you will have to contend with: 1. Ice and snow on the road This past winter I used the Schwalbe ""Marathon Winter"" tires for a 3-mile commute along a rural highway and town streets in central Vermont. Our winters are quite a bit more severe than NYC, but if you have ice on the streets that might be unavoidable, studded tires are a must. 
(photo from Flickr) At $74 a piece from Peter White Cycles, they aren't cheap, but they are decent in light/thin snow and fabulous on ice. Each tire has 240 tungsten-carbide studs, whose sharp (cylindrical) tips haven't dulled at all for me. While knobby plain-rubber tires will grip alright in snow-on-dry-pavement, as soon as a thin layer of ice forms on top of the pavement (either due to a melt-freeze cycle or packing by auto-tires) the rubber tires will very quickly loose any ability to grip and will send you down hard. With these tires I've had no problem riding a hundred yards on a large patch of black-ice on a fast downhill. 2. Wet As freiheit mentions, your other big concern is being wet since even if it isn't raining, puddle-splash and lighter mist from passing vehicles will moisten you up. As well, your own tires will throw off a lot of water from wet roads (fenders are very helpful for this).  You have quite a few options to stay dry. Since my commute is only 3 miles, I wear gore-tex rain pants and jacket over my normal work cloths. I also keep a pair of shoes at work and bike in hiking boots during the wet months of October/November and then switch to snow boots January-March. 3. Freezing bike parts When the air temperature is below freezing and your bike gets covered in moisture you can expect ice to build up. I keep my bike in my warm office at work (on some mats to catch the drips) and in an unheated shed at home. I haven't had repeated problems with freeze-ups, but did have to melt some ice off of the derailleur with a hair drier at home once. If you can get the bike warm at least once a day and keep it stored under a roof you shouldn't have too much build-up. Just remember to test your brakes frequently in case a layer of ice forms on your rims. 4. Cold winds Due to the speeds of riding, you will almost always have at least 10mph of very cold wind to contend with. Your rain gear will help with that, but you also need to protect: There are many options for gloves and mittens available, just make sure that you choose something wind-proof and waterproof. For the coldest parts of the winter I use a pair of gore-tex mittens marketed for skiing/snowboarding. I don't find the mittens to get in the way of shifting or braking on my commuter bike, but others prefer gloves for more dexterity. There are many helmet-liners and covers available to keep your head warm under a bicycle helmet, but I just use a ski helmet (the Giro 9) since it has built-in ear protectors, changeable amounts of ventilation, and nicely fits goggles.  For most of the coldest months I ride with ski goggles. These keep the wind off of my eyes (which otherwise water a lot in the cold wind) and keep most of my face warm. They are also great for protecting the face when it is snowing or sleeting. On a few bitter cold days I've also added neck warmers to cover the lower part of my face, but usually the combination of goggles and the neck of my coat are enough. 5. Overheating Counter-intuitively, my biggest challenge with winter commuting is staying cool. My commute profile is a broad 'w' with downhills at the start each way, a few small hills in the middle, and an uphill at the end. For the first large downhill I try to be a little on the cold side so that I can be comfortable for the rest of the ride. Often though, I bundle up a bit too much and overheat later. The best technique I've found (when riding in work clothes rather than changing) is to layer breathable sweaters or fleece so that I am just short of comfortable out of the wind, then add the wind-proof pants and jacket with the pit-zips and other ventilation open. The wind-proof material will keep most of the wind from cutting through while the ventilation openings will allow enough air circulation to stay cool."
Why are license plates for bicycles no longer used?,"In the Netherlands at least: The license plates for bikes were tied to the taxation of bikes. You needed to get a new plate every year.
The taxation lasted until WWII. The Germans abandoned the tax. After the war the tax wasn't introduced again so the plates were no longer needed. It was speculated that after the war the taxing of cars more then made up for the not taxing of bicycles."
How often should I change road bike tyres?,"How long a tire lasts depends on a number of factors, including what type of tires you ride, how much you weigh, the conditions you ride in, front vs rear tire, etc.  In general, a good set of tires will last a couple thousand miles. When the tire is totally worn out, you can usually see threads beneath the rubber in places.  Alternatively, the tire may start to bulge in spots.  In practice, road tires rarely get to this point.  Much more commonly, they start accumulating a lot of cuts from glass and other debris in the road.  When you start getting disproportionately many flats, it's a good idea to replace the tire (you can use the tire longer, but you'll probably waste more than a new tire's cost in tubes)."
How do I know when to replace my tires?,"The tread on a road bike's tires is really quite unimportant and purely cosmetic.  Road bike tires have tread patterns because they sell better, not because they perform better. Here's some questions to ask to decide about replacing a tire: Smooth tread is actually ideal for road conditions, but not commonly found on tires.  If you're on hard surfaces such as pavement/asphalt, the tread doesn't help you and actually slightly reduces contact area and increases rolling resistance.  On most road tires the minimal tread pattern is just cosmetic to make their customers feel better (since a smooth tire looks slippery). See also: Sheldon Brown's comments on tire replacement and tread patterns If you plan to ride through mud, sand or other soft surfaces, you need tread.  So when you no longer have tread on your mountain bike or cyclocross bike's tires, it's time to replace them (unless you plan to only use them on the road)."
Why is it easier to follow a cyclist up-hill,"I have raced Cat 1/2 for a number of years (elite road cycling) and I can unequivocally say the many here have no clue what they are talking about.  On a climb ""getting on the wheel"" is rarely about slipstreaming (unless there is a severe headwind), instead its about   positioning, pacing and psychology. Position and Pacing Rides who attack or lead out the climb are strong and will likely be climbing near their aerobic threshold.  If you don't get on immediately, a gap will form.  If you want to catch up (close the gap) you will have to work hard likely putting in an anaerobic effort.  This is not good as it will reduce your capacity to respond to future attacks (you only want to go anaerobic or near anaerobic when you absolutely have to). Then best analogy is you are like book of matches, you get so many strikes so use them wisely.  If you immediate latch onto the wheel it is your best shot at keeping your pace aerobic, therefore conserving a match. Conversely, lets suppose you say ""%^#* it I'll let a gap form.""  You continue climbing eventually matching the pace so that the gap doesn't get too big.  When you reach the top, you will have put in virtually the same effort, but they will have started on the downhill  before you reach the top.  The gap will now get even wider and all of a sudden you are screwed. You are at speed and now you have an even bigger gap to close plus you now have the added disadvantage that slipstreaming has suddenly become important again. Facing this you have two real choices, cross your fingers and hope the peloton slows (which it may - the peloton is a fickle beast), OR bust your ass and close that damn gap.  The rub is if you do close the gap you put in twice the effort you would have if you had simply got on the damn wheel when the climbing started. Road racing is like chess.  You need to plan at least five moves ahead, but unlike chess there are virtually no restriction to the type of moves you can make and there are 150 simultaneous players. Psychology  Some here seem to believe there is no psychology involved with getting on someone's wheels on a climb.  WRONG. If someone is climbing hard (at a pace you find hard to match) the best thing you can do is sit on their wheel as close as possible (we are talking 2 inches gap).  You just stare at that frackin' wheel and you DO NOT let that gap widen.  You tell yourself that you don't care how much it hurts, you will not let the gap widen.  You then keep repeating this to yourself and before you know it the climb is over.   In all seriousness, when you are right on your aerobic threshold you have to nail pacing.  Riding really close lets you judge when you are slacking off.  It is much easier to work to pick up an inch or two that you lost when your concentration waned, than it is to be farther away from the rider and realize he/she has put 5-10 feet on you.  When everyone is at a similar fitness level you need to fight for every bloody inch you can get. Focusing on something like the wheel in front helps you not focus on the pain you are currently enduring. Aside - road racing questions are fun, someone should ask about fun strategies such as guttering the peloton or rolling attacks. "
Pros and cons of single-sided forks (Cannondale Lefty)?,"The single-legged fork must truly withstand heavier bending forces than conventional forks, simply due to physics and asymmetricity. But because of its different construction, the fork is actually stiffer than most 2-legged. The top is attached like a dual crown downhill fork, which is much stiffer than a single-crown. The wheel axle is one-piece with the bottom part, which is stiffer than a quick-release axle (which is not solid at all) and on same level as a 15 thru-axle or 20 thru-axle. This design is used also on cars where the wheel doesn't have support from the other side. The biggest difference is inside. While normal forks have round tubes that slide on oil film, the Lefty uses needle bearings on a square profile (same as the front leg of Boeing airliners.):  Such solution works with almost same friction under heavy side-loads, whereas sliding tubes, when side-loaded (uneven compression of legs), do get friction losses (rolling resistance wins). Having conventional fork with one leg wouldn't work, such a fork would get stuck. Having bearing-fitted 2-legged fork is an overkill and unnecessary weight. The heaviest Lefty is still lighter than lightest carbon 2-legged. You can replace the tire without removing the wheel. If you need to remove the front wheel, you need to remove the brake caliper also. The axle works only with Cannondale hubs. The front of bike will look unbalanced until you get used to it. Pre-2013 models of Lefty are not sealed, having the bearings track just under a rubber sleeve. This required almost constant maintenance. Post-2013 models have a rubber-sealed leg with bearings further inside and with one plain bearing at the bottom which allows for service intervals as normal forks:  Previous models, as some bikers on forums complained, had more linear action: they were easier to bottom than normal forks. So now the newer ones should have more progressive compression. (This is opinion based, but quite a lot of it online, there are no measurements.) A Lefty is much harder to service than a normal fork. You need a couple of special tools, and the assembly is complicated."
"What are the disadvantages of ""puncture proof"" (or puncture resistant) tires?","Though there no doubt are ""puncture-resistant"" tires that seek to accomplish that end by means of extra-thick rubber, for the past 15-20 years the standard for puncture resistance has been Kevlar belted tires, which look and ride like ordinary tires and weight essentially the same as ordinary tires (maybe a few grams more).  The Kevlar belt under the tread increases puncture resistance by at least a factor 10, eliminating most common glass/thorn punctures, and also reducing the tendency of the tire to ""bruise"". Price wise, my recollection is that they are about 30% more expensive than standard tires, but they likely last that much longer (plus save a lot on tubes), so the cost is pretty much a wash.  (The odd thing is that Kevlar-belted tires are so hard to find.) Some people apparently confuse ""Kevlar belted"" tires with ""Kevlar bead"" tires.  The latter are ""folding"" tires and are supposedly desired because they are a hair lighter than metal bead tires, plus they can be folded and stuffed in a pannier.  But you can buy Kevlar belted with a metal bead (my preference, since folding tires are a PITA to install), and Kevlar bead tires are not necessarily Kevlar belted (in fact, most often not). Update:  Last Saturday I had my first puncture in maybe 5 years (maybe 2000 miles), while finishing up a 35-mile morning.  Just got around to fixing it because it's been ungodly hot and humid. (Hitched a ride home the last two miles, since there was no way to fix the flat in 95-degree weather on a 4-foot shoulder in the sun with traffic whizzing by at 70 MPH.) The culprit was apparently a construction staple that had pierced the tire just outside the belt, gone through the sidewall of the tube, and then punched a bigger hole in the inside diameter of the tube. I do notice the tire is wearing a bit thin, so I'll probably have to replace it within a year or so.  I'm dreading trying to find a 700/35c road tire with Kevlar belt, though -- the catalogs are now full of off-road tires and cater even less to the touring market than they did 5-10 years ago. OK -- To make this into a direct answer to the question, the main disadvantage of Kevlar belted tires is that you forget how to change a tire, you do it so rarely."
What is a narrow wide chainring and what are its benefits and drawbacks?,"Modern chains have inner and outer links.  On a conventional chainring, all of the teeth are the same width, and therefore have to be narrow enough to fit into the chain's inner links.  This means that there's enough space for the chain to move about a bit from side to side on the chainring, which can cause it to fall off. Historically this hasn't been much of a problem, since on geared bikes the front derailleur cage tends to stop it from falling off, and on single-speed bikes there's no chain slack or gear changing at the rear to cause chain-drop. However, when you remove the front derailleur, but keep the rear derailleur (as is becoming common with single-ring setups), dropping the chain becomes more of a problem.  This can happen when changing gear on the cassette, or when a bump causes the chain to go slack momentarily. Narrow-wide chainrings have alternating narrow and wide teeth that fit into the inner and outer links respectively.  This makes the chain more secure on the chainring and less likely to fall off.  A narrow-wide ring is only necessary if you have a single chainring at the front and a rear derailleur.  They won't work at all if you have more than one chainring at the front, since you won't be able to change gear.  You don't need a special cassette, but you might benefit from using a clutched rear derailleur (particularly on a MTB), which prevents the chain from going slack on bumpy terrain. A well-established alternative to a narrow-wide ring is a chain guide, which behaves somewhat like a front derailleur in keeping the chain from falling off: "
How do I make my rim brakes stop squealing?,"Squealing can be reduced by ""toe-in"" - making the front part of the brake pad touch first. Check out Park Tool's instructions on servicing side-pull brakes: http://www.parktool.com/blog/repair-help/dual-pivot-brake-service Squealing is the result of a harmonic resonance from a slip-and-stick phenomenon, similar to how a violin bow resonates on a string. The brake pads grab the rim and are pulled forward by the force of the wheel. The arms must at sometimes jerk backwards, but if you are still braking, the arms are flexed forward again. This is repeated again and again many times per second, and this creates the squeal. Because of this, flexible and less expensive arms tend to squeal more than stiff calipers of better brakes. It is possible to reduce squeal by having the leading edge of the brake pad strike first. This tends to reduce the back and forth jerking of the arms. But before you go trying to toe-in, make sure you're working with parts in good shape: Examine your brake pads. If they are old and hard, worn deeply, or full of junk, replace them. Otherwise, use coarse sandpaper to take off the surface to bring out fresh rubber. You only need to take off a tiny bit. Clean your rims. Road grime, bike lubes, and brake material all collect on your rims. Rubbing alcohol, vinegar, Simple Green, a product marketed as ""degreaser"" can all work. Don't let any get on the drivetrain or in the hubs. Also, you'll need rags.  True your wheels. There's no point in trying to adjust brakes on a wheel that isn't true (round and dished is good, too). And you can't true a wheel if the hubs aren't in good shape."
What is a thru axle?,"With a traditional non-through axle, there's a slot at the bottom of the fork (or the dropouts), the axle is hollow, and there is a skewer through axle. You use the quick-release to loosen the grip around that slot to slide the skewer (vertically) in and out of that slot, while it's still going through the wheel. With a through axle, there is simply a hole on either side, instead of a slot. You remove the axle entirely out the side of the hub in order to remove the wheel. Typically, through axles are much thicker axles. The thicker axle is stronger and stiffer. Downhill mountain bikers were breaking axles, and it's a lot harder to break a 15mm through axle than to break a 9mm traditional axle. The stiffness also helps the bike handle better (""more responsive""). From what I've heard from a framebuilder friend, the move to through axles is also because frame manufacturing techniques improved to allow them. With a traditional dropout, if the two sides were a millimeter off, the framebuilder could simply file a millimeter out of the slot on one side to make things work right. Once it's all polished and painted you'd never notice. With a through axle the framebuilder absolutely has to get the alignment just right, because an oval hole just won't work. The only downside of a through axle is that changing a flat might take an extra second or two."
Different kinds of Handlebars,"The simplest kind of handlebar, these are a straight bar with grips on the end. Flat bars were traditionally only used by cross-country riders but now you see them in more general application.  Flat bars (image credit)  Flat bars offer more space to mount lights and computers than drop bars. These bars have  bar ends attached for additional hand positions. (image credit)"
What do I get by paying more for a bicycle?,"With so many good answers I hesitate to say anything. But, in an effort to add something useful to the conversation... The Value Curve
Part of the reason it's hard to understand the difference between more and less expensive bikes is that you do get what you pay for, but cost increases faster than value.  What is Value?
For the purposes of this answer I'm defining ""value"" as some measurable improvement.
For example, a $15 steel chain that will last 3,000 miles vs an $80.00 stainless steel chain that will last 8,000 miles (made up numbers - this is only an example) Why is There a Curve?
The cost to manufacture increases faster than value. Each improvement cost more to manufacture than the last one. For Example
It's easy to see a difference between a $50.00 bike and a $400.00 bike.
It's harder (not impossible) to see the difference between a $800.00 bike and an $1200.00 bike.
As price goes up it gets harder and harder to see an increase in value. I would argue that at some price point there is no value increase and you are paying (hopefully) for craftsmanship, like extra polish or fancy lug work or exotic materials that are expensive but don't contribute to a measurable difference.  Suppose I agree that there is a value curve - what should I do?
There is a ""sweet spot"" in the curve. A place where you get the most bang for your buck. The problem is that I can't tell you exactly where that is because it changes over time and it depends on the individual's situation - finances and type of riding.
Bike shoppers have to balance their budget with the desired level of performance and decide where their sweet spot is.   Always test ride bikes before buying. Always ride more than one so you can compare.
A parking lot is not a great way to compare ride but it's much better than nothing. Bike feel matters."
Creaking from cranks/spindle. How to fix?,"There are many possible causes of creaking. But Deemar has the most likely reason in this case - the cranks are loose on the axle. Think about how a creak is produced. It's one item sliding over another. But instead of sliding it's repeatedly sticking then jumping. The amount of movement might only be a fraction of a millimetre. The OP would have noticed if the cranks were really loose. But in this case the looseness may be at the microscopic scale.  You can easily test this without having to run alongside the bike. Get on the bike with the brakes on and your shoulder against a wall. Rotate the pedals so the cranks are horizontal and bounce up and down with your weight equally on both pedals. This twists the cranks and axle as far as possible in one direction. Then rotate the pedals to a position 180 degrees from that (the other foot forward) and do the same. This twists the assembly as far as possible the other way. Repeat the procedure listening all the while for creaks. Testing in this way avoids many other sources of noise such as wheels, chain, seat, etc. Take care. If something breaks or your foot slips off the pedal you'll hurt yourself.  When new the cranks have a square tapered hole which fits exactly onto the tapered square on the axle. As Deemar says, if it has been wobbling for a while the hole will be damaged and you may never get a satisfactory fit. On my bike I fixed it (at least for now) by carefully reshaping the inside of the square holes with a file and cleaning the square shaft on the axle. Then I assembled it with grease. To get the parts to bed in together I applied the following procedure repeatedly. Bash the crank a few times with a soft hammer. Bounce up and down on the pedals as above. Retighten the bolt. Eventually the soft aluminium crank took up the shape of the hard axle and the creaking was completely eliminated. You will probably need to do this for both cranks.  Remember that the amount of movement between the crank and axle may be so small it's imperceptible. You may not see it moving. But you will be hear the result when you do the pedal bouncing test. On my bike the noise was really loud and infuriating and now it's completely silent. I will re-tighten the bolt periodically. If it loosens again I may have to replace the cranks and bottom bracket. "
How often should I lube my chain?,Lubricate when needed.  I don't think it's possible to put a mile marker on when to lube.  I think most people add chain lube too often.  Too much can cause debris to build up on the chain.  Too little lube can cause unnecessary friction; but you'll know pretty quickly by the looks (and possibly sound) of it if you have too little lube. Hints: Tips: ^ [*]. Wiping off the chain is best done in a work stand or while the bike is in a position where you can rotate the crankarm such that you can hold a rag to the chain while the chain is moving.
Why is the front brake lever on the right if you 'drive' on the left and vice-versa?,"I believe the reason is that the hand signals used to indicate braking generally involve using your 'road side' hand. In countries that drive on the left, this is your right hand and vice versa. The back brake was considered the 'safer' brake to use during this pre-braking time when you're indicating that you will brake but haven't necessarily started braking yet."
Why would one ever buy a 12-25 cassette when an 11-25 is available?,"If you want to maximize your max. speed, go for an 11 tooth cog. If you want to maximize your average speed, unless you're a pro you probably are better off without it. Even cruising at 40km/h does not require and 11 tooth cog. For example, take a look at this table, showing cruising1 speeds for a 11- 21 tooth cassette:
 And compare to this table for a 12 - 25 tooth cassette:  You can see that the 11 tooth cog is only really useful for cruising speeds that riders at the professional level can maintain, or for short bursts. So, like I said, if you aren't trying to break your own max speed record, you may be better off with a 12 tooth cog. (Tables screen captured from bikecalc.com. Check it out.) I remember reading a while back about how most riders can't maintain a high enough wattage output to make an 11 tooth cog worthwhile, but I couldn't turn it up. Maybe another contributor will post it. 1 Cruising here means pedalling at 90 r.p.m."
Why do e-bikes need dedicated tires?,"They don't need them but they are good to have. I have an e-bike that I use as a daily commuter. Here are my thoughts: All in all, I'm still on the original tire which is a regular tire. I'm on the tail end of its lifetime which has only been about 1/3 that of a regular tire. I will replace it either with a beefy ""regular"" tire or go with one from an e-bike line. I think the actual difference between the two (beefy regular or touring and a e-bike tire) will in reality be minimal. Update 2018.7: I ended up replacing my rear tire ahead of schedule due to a sidewalk blowout. I’m not actually sure if it was natural wear or if the bike was shivved by a thief. Replaced with a tire from an ebike tire line.  TL;DR: Ebikes require a strong, hard-wearing, high speed, puncture resistant tire. These are also roughly the same requirements as touring tires so some vendors are labeling their touring tires as ""ebike ready."""
Leaving lock on the parking rack - is this rude?,"Whether it's rude is a matter of local custom. Whether you're offended by it depends on your flexibility and sensitivity Often, we cyclists can become a little over sensitive, after having to defend ourselves from car doors, pedestrians, cars, trucks, laws that don't take us into account, police who have a ticket quota, and even other cyclists. Relax. The person who left it there is just trying to save themselves the trouble of carrying it every day. And yes, you can still park your bike there. Of course they may think you're rude then, so I'd only park there if it was the last position available."
How much does bike price correspond with maintenance needs?,"The cheaper bike will probably require you to adjust the brakes and gears plus lube the chain every week or two, and a bike shop to replace the brake pads, chain and cassette every 3-20Mm. For you, that's probably twice in the winter, once in the summer. With rim brakes you will also need new rims/wheels every couple of years, more often if the roads are gritty. But a lot depends on your riding style and the enthusiasm you have for maintenance (hence the 3-20 range). If ""lube the chain every week"" actually means ""the bike shop does that every month or two"", they'll probably be putting on a new chain. Count a monthly service at ~$50 and the chain/cassette/pads as $200 and that's $1000/year in maintenance, or $600 if you do the monthly service yourself. It's important to note that you can skimp on all of this and it just means slightly more expensive fixes and a slightly worse riding experience (gears that skip under power, more resistance from damaged bearings, cables or chains the break, brakes that don't really work). When I was a mechanic I saw bikes where basically everything needed to be replaced, but people were still riding them (and just wanted a puncture fixed or a new basket or something). The bad riding experience means an hour for your 18km commute instead of 40 minutes. With hub gears and disk brakes, especially with a full chain case, you'll lube the chain every couple of months, put new brake pads in every year or two, and I expect that replacing tyres will become your main dirty maintenance task. With a single-cable hub (Shimano, SRAM) you'll have to adjust the gears after a couple of months (the free service) then again a few months before you need a new gear cable. If you run Marathons or some other puncture-resistant tyre you should wear the tyre out without getting a puncture (a puncture is often the thing that makes you look at the tyre and go ""need a new one"". I run a Marathon Plus on the rear and have only had one puncture in at least 20Mm. I did get a 3"" nail through one though (with no puncture!) Those numbers are why people often end up with a dedicated commuter bike that costs a fortune up front. New Rohloff Oil every year at $20 compared to a new Shimano hub every three years at $800 makes the $2000 up front cost of a Rohloff seem cheap (a Rohloff will last 100,000 kilometres or more... no-one really knows because there aren't many hubs that have done that distance yet, Rohloff only started about 10 years ago)."
Building from scratch vs. buying new,"The pros of buying pre-built are the cons of building your own. Each approach is born of very different requirements.  That is, the person who is actually likely to build their own is very unlikely to buy off the shelf and vice versa.  (I assume that 'build from scratch' also covers getting the LBS to do it for you to your specification). I would caution everybody thinking of building their own that you will get much better 'value for money' if you buy pre-built.  A $1000 pre-built will get you much higher quality parts than a $1000 build your own.  This disparity seems to reduce the sillier the price becomes at the high end. You will need access to some specialized and expensive tools (thanks Gary!) and the skills to go with them. There is, as always, an intermediate stage where you source everything yourself but have the LBS do the trickier jobs like headset pressing, bottom bracket cups and steerer tube cutting/star nut pressing.  Just remember that your LBS is a business and needs to make money - so buy the parts from them if you want them to fit them! Pros Cons Pros Cons"
Why do the majority of people on an ebike ride at a fairly low cadence?,"There are (at least) two reasons. First, most (but not all) E-bikes use a control system that multiplies the amount of force or torque that you put into the pedals or cranks. Since power is the product of pedal speed and pedal force (or torque), increasing the torque allows the rider to reduce the pedal speed -- that is, the rider's cadence. Electric motors (can) produce full torque at any rpm, so these controllers typically modulate the torque output rather than the rpm.   Second, if a rider on an E-bike were riding at ""normal"" cadence for his or her speed you would be less likely to notice the rider, so your observational sample is likely to be more heavily weighted to those with lower than normal cadence. "
How to do a track stand?,Here are my snippets of advice from when I learnt to trackstand:
Is it better to have a slightly big or slightly small bike?,"Rivendell Bikes argues that most road bikes sold are too small.  They're probably in the minority opinion as far as bike shops go, but they have (collectively) a lot of experience in frame geometry and riding styles. Their argument is based on their belief that most shops assume that road riders should emulate racers—experts who are willing to put up with a lot of discomfort to gain small efficiencies—and that this alienates a lot of casual riders, commuters, and tourists who would be better served by a bike that fits comfortably. Most bikes are sold too small. We see it all the time: bars way below the saddle, the rider leaned over 35-degrees with arms straight out as his hands are on the brake hoods. If he took his hands off the bar he'd flop down and smack his nose on the stem. It's not comfortable or correct. When you come to us for a bike, we'll ask what size you ride now, and invariably put you on a bike that's two to five centimeters bigger. You'll still have crotch clearance, but your bar will be higher, you'll lean over less, and you'll be a lot more comfortable. and (emphasis added) Most riders are most comfortable when the handlebar is a few centimeters higher than the saddle. Some like it four or five inches higher. Some like the look of the bar lower than the saddle, but few riders over 35 like a low bar once they've ridden a higher one. To achieve that bar height, it helps to start with a bike that's the largest practical size you can ride. We suggest you get the size that allows you to put the handlebar at least 2cm higher than the saddle. That works great for most people. You can always lower the bar if you find it's too high, but it's rare when that happens. and especially relevant when dealing with sales-people: Sometimes a bike feels funny or uncomfortable, but the salesperson tells you that you're just not used to it, or you're using muscles you haven't used before, and it takes a few weeks to adapt. Don't believe it. There's always some getting used to it, but right off the bat, sitting on a new bike that fits you and is set up right so that it gives you a good position should feel about as natural as sitting in a chair. Your hands on the bars should feel like hands on a table in front of you. There is something to be said for breaking in your bottom or whatever, but it should feel at least reasonable right off the bat. You shouldn't have to adapt to or tolerate discomfort even a little, not even when the bike is new. You can also read Rivendell's wider philosophy that includes some of the elements above."
What cadence should I aim for?,"For any given speed, you can either spin at a higher cadence in a lower gear, or a lower cadence in a higher gear.  The high cadence + low gear combination should reduce the strain on your joints since you don't have to push as hard.  You just have to do it more often. I like to ride around 90rpm and sometimes drift up to 100-110 especially if I'm trying to catch up to or overtake someone.  I'll drop down to 80 for long, steep climbs (seated -- no idea what my cadence is standing). Lance Armstrong apparently maintains 110rpm for efficiency.  It took me a while to get used to 90 so I'd suggest building up to it slowly.  Let us know when you can do 110 comfortably!"
What is the maximum tire or minimum tire width I can fit on my bicycle,"Maximum tire width is dependent on two main factors, clearance at the frame/fork, and the width of the rim. As for the frame clearance this can usually be visually inspected and easily distinguished if a larger tire than the present tire will cause issues. Brakes such as V-brakes or cantilevers may also cause clearance problems with some tires so attention should be paid to them as well. Mud or other debris should also be considered for mountain bikes and applications with fenders/mudguards. You should not run clearances so tight that one little pebble caught in the tread will hit the frame, fenders or other parts. Think of the difference between both sizes you are considering and then split that number in half, that is the distance you will need to be able to clear on either side of the tire at the chainstay essentially. So if there is a 4 mm difference in road tires, the new size will roughly add an additional 2mm onto either side of the existing tire is one way to think about it, but the top of the tire needs to also be checked as the new tire may also be taller in addition to the increased width. Knobs on MTB tires can also vary greatly and play a part in your decisions and fitment as well. One 2.25"" tire may come out to be shorter than another more aggressive 2.25"" tire due to the shape and size of the knobs. As for rim to tire interface there are multiple guidance charts available online that give a rough estimate if a tire is compatible with a certain rim width, such as this one from J&B Importer's, a bicycle parts distributor's catalog. As an example you can see that a rim width of 19mm (top row) should be compatible with tire width of 28mm/1.10"" through 62mm or about 2.5"". But seeing as 28mm is the lower end of that column it might be reasonable to go a little larger and avoid the extreme values.  However just because it will fit on the rim does not mean it will not rub on the frame so that is what is most important. For small changes such as from 26 x 1.95 to 26 x 2.125, or 700C x 23 to 700C x 25 you are almost certainly safe from a rim standpoint if the bicycle was factory equipped with 1.95""/700x23 tires. To be certain, the model of rim should be referenced and the width noted. Please also note that the same applies to going to a smaller tire size, too small of a tire on the same rim could not seal well and potentially cause flats or blowouts when the tire bead cannot seal against the rim well enough. Edit: July 2020 - Suggest reading the the answer posted by @Weiwen Ng which contains updated information."
How do I separate hydraulic disc brake pads after pulling the brake while the wheel is off?,"As mentioned try a blunt bladed instrument (A large flat blade screwdriver will do) to pry the pads back in. Just put the screwdriver between the pads and lever the pads apart evenly! 
Just be carful though as sometimes the pistons that push the pads out can come out too far resulting in the pistons being slighly out of line, however if the pads have plenty of material left on them you should be fine to just lever them back in with the screwdriver, ther will be some resistance as you will also be pushing against the pistons and fluid pressure."
How to move a bicycle by bicycle,"Walk :) Safest. I do this from time to time (usually when one of the kids have 'forgotten' their bike), and find it easiest to do as pr above, but with a little variation. If the transported bike is lightweight and otherwise allows it, simply 'wear' it as a backpack, putting your arm through the big triangle. Once it's on, you can determine if it will Work.
Did this once with a racing bike at 7,5Kg.  As the other answers, except I grab the center of the handlebar with palm forward, and then lift the front Wheel of the bike. 
This allows me to sit on my own bike more comfortably, and balance is way better since the transported bike doesn't try to steer."
What is the optimal cadence?,"""Optimal"" cadence varies with what you're trying to optimze, so your question doesn't have a simple answer.  A recent review by Hansen et al. summarizes what is currently known about factors affecting choice of cadence. In particular, they conclude ""[d]uring high-intensity cycling, close to the maximal aerobic power output, cyclists choose an energetically economical cadence that is also favorable for performance. In contrast, the choice of a relatively high cadence during cycling at low-to-moderate intensity is uneconomical and could compromise performance during prolonged cycling."" The first sentence means that experienced cyclists freely choose the cadence that produces good performances and they don't need to have someone dictate what that cadence is. The last sentence means that having an inappropriate cadence forced on you can be detrimental to performance.   The relatively recent proliferation of on-bike power meters that record both power and cadence has helped provide additional data that bears on the issue. By definition, a cyclist's power output = cadence * crank torque * a conversion constant (the conversion constant depends on the units you use for measuring power, cadence, and torque; if you measure power in watts, cadence in radians per second, and crank torque in Newton meters, the conversion constant is 1). If you are racing at high power, or riding leisurely at low power along a bike path with your children, or on a spirited ride with friends, you will certainly choose different power levels; what has become clear from the data is that riders, even very experienced ones, choose different combinations of cadence and crank torque to match higher or lower levels of power. They do not always choose a fixed cadence and change gears in order to keep in robotic lockstep with that number.  But even if we exclude leisurely riding and focus only on racing (at high power), cadence and crank torque vary according to the type of race. Here are cadence-crank torque plots for the same (domestic pro) rider in three different types of races: a road race, a criterium race, and a time trial. Torque is measured in Newton-meters, while cadence is measured in rpm. The thin red dotted lines show the combinations of cadence and torque that produce 300, 500, and 700 watts. As you may be able to see, the three different types of races call for different combinations of cadence and crank torque. The time trial shown here was done at a relatively steady power level but the road race and criterium race were much more variable. For those races, the rider attained higher power by increasing both cadence and crank torque. This is a quite common pattern for road racing, and it helps to explain why observers often remark that racers pedal at high cadence: the racers are also pedaling at high power and high crank torque but the only visible clue is the high cadence. This, then, is the basis for the sentences quoted from Hansen et al. above: the cadence used to produce high power appears to be neither economical nor performance-enhancing at low power. Just because you see a Tour de France rider pedal at X rpm doesn't mean you should pedal at X rpm (unless you also produce Tour de France levels of power). Likewise, just because you see that a Tour de France rider spends little of his time at Y rpm doesn't mean you should avoid pedaling at Y rpm. Your needs, abilities, and goals will differ.   Your question also asked whether cadence varies with terrain. Here is a plot of cadence and torque for a rider who was doing a set of hill intervals. The upper left panel shows his cadence and torque over the entire ride. The upper right panel shows the elevation profile for his ride; as can be seen, the ride was slightly rolling from his house out to a hill which he climbed and descended four times, then he returned home over the rolling road. That upper right panel marks the climbing portion of his ride in red. The bottom two panels show his cadence and torque for the corresponding black and red portions of the ride. As before, the thin dotted lines (this time, in blue) show ""isopower contours."" Clearly, he used different combinations of cadence and torque on the climbing sections than on the descending and rolling sections.  To emphasize this point, here is a plot that shows cadence vs. estimated road gradient for ProTour rider Gustav Larsson during Stage 3 of the 2009 Tour of California. As you can see, even if we exclude periods of coasting, his cadence varied from around 20 rpm up to around 120 rpm, and as the road gradient became steeper, his cadence decreased.   Do you wonder about the relationship between cadence and crank torque? Here is a plot showing another rider in a ""pure"" hill climb. The upper left panel shows the relationship between cadence and power; the upper right shows the relationship between crank torque and power; and the bottom two panels show the relationship between cadence and crank torque, one with and one without isopower contours. The bottom panels make clearer that there is often an inverse relationship between cadence and crank torque, but the upper panels show that in this instance crank torque was a larger determinant of power output than cadence.   Some riders claim that slow cadences (below, say, 60 rpm) can injure knees. However, slow cadence cannot by itself injure knees; as you sit at your desk reading these words, your “cadence” is almost surely close to zero but the force on your knees is also low. Riders who make these claims are conflating low cadence with high force. From the plots provided it should be clear that one of the simplest ways to expose the knees to lower force is simply to ride at lower power. Riding at 60 rpm at low power can be done with low pedal force; riding at 90 rpm at high power must be done with high pedal force. So level of power output (also known as “workload”) is a key to understanding joint strain. In the mid-1980s, M. Ericson published a series of studies examining forces on the hip, knee, ankle, foot, and the leg muscles during cycling including this one. Importantly, he concluded, “[o]f the four parameters studied (workload, pedalling rate, saddle height, pedal foot position) workload was the most important adjustment factor for change of joint load and muscular activity. An increased pedalling rate increased the muscular activity in most of the muscles investigated, generally without changing the joint load. Increased saddle height decreased the maximum flexing knee load moment, but did not significantly change the flexing hip or dorsiflexing ankle load moment. Muscular activity in most of the muscles investigated was not generally changed by different saddle heights.”   Some riders will use their indoor trainers and observe that their ""preferred"" 
cadence (perhaps for a particular level of power or heart rate) is X rpm, and then try to ride at that rpm outdoors. As we have seen above, freely-chosen cadence varies with terrain, power, and the way that resistance scales with speed. Of importance here is that trainers also vary in the way that resistance scales with speed. Below you can see a plot for the same rider on two different types of trainers but using the same gear ratio on both: a trainer with a fluid resistance unit, and on rollers. Each dot shows the cadence and crank torque at one second intervals. As you can see, these two types of trainers have very different resistance curves, with the rollers being much ""flatter"" with increasing rpm. In order to attain the same power, the rider appears to choose higher cadence (and lower crank torque). In order to attain the same level of power (say, 175 watts) the rider's freely chosen cadence varies with the type of resistance. ""Transferring"" indoor trainer cadence to an outdoor ride ignores both that outdoor rides vary, but also that trainers vary.   Yes, most of the UCI hour records over the last 50 years have been set with cadences from about 100 rpm to 107 rpm (with the notable exception of Obree, who set his records at 93 and 95 rpm). However, the hour record is set with a fixed-gear bicycle on a track and, more importantly, all of the records have been set at high power and high crank torque. Below you can see the cadence and crank torque for many of the recent hour records based on data from Bassett et al.; the plot shows that for recent records set at sea level, average power ranged from around 370 to 460 watts and crank torque ranged from 36 to 43 Nm. One wouldn't tell a novice rider to pedal at a constant crank torque of 40 Nm yet many advise novices to ride at close to 100 rpm. Using the cadence of world record setting events achieved on a fixed gear on a velodrome track as a guide for more general riding makes about as much sense as using the crank torque of the same world record setting events achieved on a fixed gear on a velodrome track as a guide for more general riding.   The conclusion from all of this is that cadence varies both with the ride and with the rider. In that sense, asking about ""optimal cadence"" is, in isolation of the characteristics of the ride and rider, a red herring. Without the proper context, asking about optimal cadence is like asking about optimal power, or optimal crank torque. "
What pressure should I run my Road Bike tyres at?,"All other things being equal, run them as high as the tyre manufacturer recommends (there will be an advisory notice on the tyre wall). For most tyres of even medium quality, this should be at least 100psi, if not 110; higher end tyres might go up to 130+. (I generally inflate both tyres to similar pressures, but I think that there are some theories that if either were to be higher, that should be the rear, because it carries the majority of the weight.)  Indeed, the higher the pressure and the harder the tyre, the fewer punctures you should expect as the surface should be better at repelling objects.  You should keep tyres topped up, natural leakage occurs and at the higher pressures you might expect 10-20 psi drift within a week.  When re-inflating, you should also take the opportunity to inspect the tyres. Any deformity or wear will be sure to be far more obvious and damaging when the tyre is inflated to the limits of its recommended pressure.  The only caveat is in poor weather, where a reduction in pressure increases the contact area and introduces give, which should make for enhanced traction. "
Using a ski helmet for winter biking,"I wear a Bern Brentwood with a winter liner in cold weather. It's a certified bike helmet, but designed more like a ski helmet. The winter liner does a great job of keeping my ears warm without wearing any other protection, but doesn't block traffic noise. It is vented, but not well enough that it makes my head cold. It also has a clip in the back for ski goggles if you're using them. With the summer liner it works well for fall and spring, too.  "

"Do I really have to replace the cassette when I replace the chain, or is this a scam?","At our shop, we suggest a new cassette every 2 times you replace your chain, IF you stay on top of your maintenance schedule. With 99% of customers this would mean a new cassette every 1-2 years depending on how much you ride it. If you are a commuter and ride everyday, your timeframe for replacement gets much smaller. We would also assess the condition of the bike. If it looks like it has been neglected, we can, with high confidence (we do hundreds of these bikes a year), tell that you would need a new cassette as well. What I tell every customer in your situation is as follows: A chain that is not cleaned regularly will attract and hold dirt. That dirt will act like 50-grit sandpaper on everything it touches. When the chain stretches out, it will wear the cassette equally. If we try to put a new chain on a worn out cassette, the teeth on the old cassette will match the old worn out chain and won’t properly hold the new chain. We recommend replacing the cassette for every 2 chains so we can guarantee shifting performance from our tune. If replacing the cassette is something you want to hold off on we can try to put a new chain on the old cassette, however we may find that we can tell what your favorite gears are and it may skip under load. You can always ask them to just put a chain on, check to see if they can make the adjustment, and call you if it is skipping or poorly shifting. However, since your chain and cassette were only a month old when the chain snapped, unless you have a bent/broken tooth on your cassette, it should be good if everything else is adjusted correctly.  As far as the snapped chain, it may come from manufacturer defect, improper installation, or you may need to revise your shifting strategy. You want to make sure you’re not cross-chaining. This will put a lot of stress on the components and will wear things out quickly and possibly snap your chain. Also, your bike doesn’t have a clutch, so you have to back off on power when your shifting. Right before you’re about to shift, let off pedaling a bit and wait for the gear to change. This will increase shifting speed and accuracy. We do see a lot of customers resolve shifting problems with proper information on shifting. (If you’re shifting the proper way, then disregard. It’s more for people who will view this post later.)"
Should I change both tires when I need to change one?,"No. In a car, the weight distribution is relatively even and you tend to get a relatively even wear, so that if 2 or 3 tires are obviously ready for replacement, you probably just can't tell that the others are ready. I suspect that also having 1 tire with a different amount of tread wear than the other tires on a car will lead to an unbalanced configuration that causes tires to wear out faster. (especially a left-right imbalance) With a bicycle, the rear tire gets more weight on it than the front and will generally wear out more quickly.  By as much as 3:1. Because of this, and other reasons, some people will even use a totally different tire on front than on the back.  (could have the narrower tire on the front or on the back, depending on what you want to achieve)  On a bicycle, it's perfectly fine if one tire has worn down to being effectively smaller than the other.  You will never notice if the bike is ""leaning"" a millimeter or two forward or back. The rear also tends to pick up more thorns/nails/screws/glass than the front, so there's also that reason the rear may need to be replaced sooner. The usual theory I've heard is that the front tire knocks the sharp things into a point up configuration in time for the rear tire to catch them, but I strongly suspect that it's more about weight distribution: the tire with more weight has a bigger contact patch and will push down harder on something it rolls over. Overuse of the rear brake instead of learning to use the front brake properly can cause the rear to wear out even quicker. You also don't want to rotate your tires between front and back.  That's something suggested with some cars, I think because you tend to wear the front differently than the back and can get a longer life that way. However, if you're using the same type of tires on the front and the back, and it's the rear tire that's being replaced, you probably want to move the front to the back, and put the new tire on the front. You always want your best tire on the front.  A blowout in the rear is scary and inconvenient, but a blowout on the front is very likely to lead to a crash.  You also need the traction on the front for stopping much more than you need traction on the rear for acceleration. (and because your weight shifts forward as you stop, you just can't get very much traction on the rear for stopping) Reference: http://www.sheldonbrown.com/tire-rotation.html"
At what time of year can I buy a bicycle for the best price?,"According to lifehacker end of January or February:  http://lifehacker.com/5440376/the-best-times-to-buy-anything-all-year-round why? Bicycles and outdoor gear

The stores start replacing fall and winter stuff with spring and summer models, and that's true for most all outdoor gear from shoes to bikes, hiking gear, everything,"" says Dennis Lewon, senior editor for Outside magazine.
Some companies will send out special holiday items that will land in the discount section after the season. ""In general, most of the new products come to stores in February,"" Lewon says. ""January is good for looking for the old models in the classic post-holiday shopping period."""
Why do cyclists shave their legs?,"Cyclists shaving their legs is more tradition than anything else--there is a whole industry around creams, soaps, and salves. However, I'll defer to Sheldon Brown's explanation for a few acceptable reasons why they do it: One reason I've often heard is 'To be more streamlined in the wind'--but I don't believe it!"
Are there advantages of dedicated bike computer instead of smartphone apps?,"I recently thought that my smartphone would replace my bike computer, but have come to the conclusion that the bike computer is better. Here are the reasons. A few months back, I bought a smartphone handlebar mount and case which all looked fine in the comfort of my basement. Anyway, once on the bike and in real conditions, it was unusable. The worst thing was that in the glare of sun, I couldn't even see the screen. Also, changing functions was a pain because of the case. Anyway, I rapidly went back to my bike computer. BTW...I do carry my phone with me and use Endomondo. However, the phone stays in my jersey pocket; but for typical ride data I use the bike specific computer."
How to ride when the weather is hot?,"Several questions, several answers: Yes, for me that's about 45°C. At that temperature where I live (Australia) the air is usually so hot that even wearing glasses it's hard to blink often enough to keep my eyeballs from drying out. Wrap-around glasses, complete skin coverage, and riding slowly is the only way to go. Or it's just before the rainy season and sweat is pouring off me just standing in the shade, so I don't go outside if I can avoid it. Ideally, yes, regardless of whether you're riding. But 35°C is not especially hot, it's more that it is useful to pre-hydrate and make sure you're drinking to replace sweat. My usual is to buy cordial powder and add salt until it's undrinkable when I'm at home testing it. When I'm riding it starts to taste good, so I drink it. ""electrolyte drinks"" that work taste foul when you don't need them, if they taste like soft drink they're purely there to replace the sugar and are thus a waste of money. You should also be drinking 2-3 times as much water as electrolyte drink. But again, at 35°C you should be able to ride an hour or more without issues (I ride 45 minutes home from work at that temperature in the summer, and drink before the ride and after, rarely during). This is important. If you start to feel weak or have a headache you should stop, drink and cool down. If you stop sweating you're about to die, so you should immediately seek cool shelter and warn the people present (there must be people present) that you're suffering heatstroke and may pass out. Note that ""sweat evaporates as fast as it appears"" and ""not sweating"" are very different things. I find my back will generally stay wet up to about 40°C, and above that I try not to ride very hard because my body and especially my brain does not like getting above 40°C so I need to sweat just to stay alive, forget exercising. Anything you can do to stay cooler while riding is good. But note that riding close to building or on roads ""in the shade"" is often no better than being in the sun as they will reflect and absorb/re-radiate heat. Trees are good, riverside or on a path near a creek (even a dry creek) are better. Mostly, pay attention to how hot you feel. I took photos last summer of heat blisters on my hands from resting on the brake hoods of my bike. That was at only about 38-40°C, but riding through a built up area with lots of shiny buildings and fingerless cycle gloves - you could see that the blisters were where bare skin had touched black plastic hoods. The blisters were really annoying to work around while they healed. It's a waste of water, unless you have lots. A sock around a waterbottle, wet, can help but if it's hot and dry it won't help much, or for long. Keep the water for when you need it. Not in Australia, where the law requires a helmet. I would consider it, and sometimes do, but I much prefer a helmet cover with a wide brim, then a headsock under the helmet to stop the sweat running into my eyes. It's much easier to wash or swap a sweatband or head-covering than to clean a helmet, especially if you're riding in the heat every day. Clothing The hotter it is the more I cover up. I'm a white guy, so in theory my skin is more reflective than black skin, but forget it, if I don't cover up I get way too hot.  At moderate temperatures I don't bother, riding home from work I just accept that I'll get hot and since it's a known journey if I get home uncomfortably hot that's bearable. So I wear a white, long sleeve t short and white knee-length cargo shorts, plus helmet cover. But when it's hot, usually I'm touring, so I wear the full kit. Head covering as above, then a long sleeve white t shift (cotton is fine, and SPF 50 or higher is better (in Australia we get SPF rated clothing)). I will attach that to white gloves, buying the lightest, baggiest gloves I can find. Strangely, dishwashing gloves are more available and work better than gardening gloves. I wear cycling glove under them, because the offer basically no road protection. Then I wear cycling kicks with long, baggy cotton pants over the top. Those tuck into my socks. Basically the only skin you see is my face, and not a lot of that. Hydration I prefer to drink enough that I have to stop and pee every couple of hours. If the pee burns I will drink right there until I can't drink any more without throwing up. This is when I will normally drop a film canister full of cordial powder+salt into my drink bottle, drink that, then straight water until I'm full. The goal is to get that water into my bloodstream as fast as possible. You should never, ever get to that stage just riding at 35°C. That has only happened to me when I've been at the end of a long day touring after making a mistake and having to ride further, harder, than I expected. Time of Day/ Avoid the darn heat Finally, and most importantly, if you can avoid riding when it's uncomfortably hot, do that. I have flexitime at work, and in the hot part of the summer I will start later and finish later so I'm not riding home when it's hottest (normally I work 7am-3pm, but much over 35°C I'll start between 0830 and 1000, so I finish later). When cycle touring I'll either ride early or ride a split shift. I'll start at first light (30-60 minutes before dawn) then ride until I'm hungry, tired, or hot. Then I'll stop and spend the day trying to avoid the heat while being a tourist, and possibly ride again when it cools down. If you're working and riding for exercise, do it before or after work/office hours. First light is a great time to be out, you'll see any local wildlife before people drive them out of sight, and it's a very calm time of the day in most places. Or follow the crowd and go out for a ride after work. There's more people, less wildlife, and it's usually hotter, but that is relative to dawn, not midday, it's still a lot better than riding at 3pm."
My bike got stolen a second time (in Amsterdam) - what should I do? [duplicate]," You also have to consider that thieves want a quick and easy job. If your bike is secured like the picture above with a strong lock, they'll probably just move on to an easier target unless it's a very valuable bike which you've locked in public, something I'd advise against."
Why are regenerative brakes uncommon on e-bikes?,"There are several reasons for regenerative brakes not being common on bicycles unlike in electric cars: Electric bicycles have very poor acceleration, and the rider produces about half of the acceleration with the motor producing the rest. The power is limited by the low-speed motor, not the battery. Most quality electric motors like to spin at 5000 - 20000 RPM, but in e-bikes they do not spin at any such speed range. The best RPM situation in electric bikes is in mid-drive bikes that have enough space to use reduction gears, and the mid-drive arrangement does not allow regenerative braking due to the freewheel. The worst RPM situation in electric bikes (lowest RPM) is in hub motors, the only arrangement that would make regenerative braking possible. These hub motors cannot produce high forwards torque, and therefore, cannot produce high inverse torque for braking. In contrast, electric cars are well-known for their high acceleration, thus allowing rapid braking. An electric bicycle with regenerative braking could produce only half of its poor acceleration as braking force, and it is not at all significant. A common use case for regenerative braking in electric cars is going downhill. Most car drivers drive always very near the speed limit (unless traffic condition or safety requires otherwise). In contrast, most bicyclists ride at a very low speed that could be much higher. A car driver going downhill needs to brake to keep under the speed limit, whereas a bicyclist often uses a downhill as an opportunity for going fast. The most common braking at downhills for bicyclists is a 90-degree or hairpin turn after a downhill, and to maximize average speed, most bicyclists only brake very close to the turn, instead of braking all the time before the turn. Thus, a downhill is not a good location for an electric bicyclist to brake. Another common use case for regenerative braking in electric cars is stopping at a red light. In contrast to cars where braking close to red lights instead of anticipating the traffic lights far away is common even for internal combustion engine cars lacking regenerative braking, most bicyclists have learned an energy-saving way of going through traffic lights, avoiding unnecessary accelerations to high speeds only to need to brake right away. While a regenerative brake could be useful for an electric bicyclist adopting a different rapid start - rapid stop riding style, most bicyclists do not consider such a riding style necessary. The final killing blow making regenerative braking infeasible is the controlling of such brakes. In most cars, there is natural engine braking. Some electric or hybrid-electric cars (Toyota) simulate the typical engine braking amount with regenerative braking, while at the same time having complicated (expensive, heavy) machinery to adapt between regenerative braking and disc braking using the brake pedal. This approach has the advantage of familiarity for most automatic transmission car drivers. Such an expensive, complicated and heavy machine would not be acceptable on a bicycle. Other electric cars (Tesla) cheat somewhat and make the engine braking huge, to avoid having the complicated (expensive, heavy) machinery to adapt between regenerative braking and disc braking when the driver presses the brake pedal. In contrast, high-quality bicycles have extremely low rolling resistance and no engine braking -- there is a freewheel. The natural slight regenerative braking would be of no value in such a bicycle. The braking controls of a high-quality bicycle are independent levers for front and rear wheels. A regenerative brake would work on only one of those levers. Most of the time, the bicyclist uses the front brake only, and most quality hub motor electric bicycles are not front wheel drive for a good reason (when going uphill seated, the front wheel is practically unloaded and would slip). Even for a bicyclist that brakes with the rear brake, there would need to be complicated (expensive, heavy) machine to operate both the regenerative brake and the disc/rim brake with the same lever. Cyclists would not find such a piece of machinery acceptable. Thus, the only way to make regenerative braking possible would be to add a third regenerative brake only control working only for the rear brake. It would be a terrible brake due to the low torque of hub motor drive. Such a brake would be unused for most of the time. Also, to produce useful torque at low weight, an electric motor needs to spin fast. The only arrangement making the drive motor spin fast on an e-bike is mid-drive, where the motor drives the bottom bracket through reduction gears. Such an arrangement does not work with regenerative brakes due to rear derailleur being the chain tensioner, and due to the freewheel in the rear wheel. Because regenerative brakes have terribly low power (reason #1), no valid use case (reasons #2 and #3) and no feasible means of control (reason #4), and because mid-drive is the most logical drive variant in e-bikes that makes regenerative braking impossible, regenerative brakes are not feasible on e-bikes unlike they are in electric cars."
When should I not use my front brake?,"It's more dangerous as a kid to flip over your bars because there is much less weight preventing the bike from pivoting around your front wheel when you use your front brake.  The danger still exists as an adult, but using the front brake definitely improves braking performance. If you don't slam the brake there shouldn't be any problems. Additionally you might want to keep your weight on the back of the bike while braking downhill. Sheldon Brown covers the topic of braking, you might want to give it a read."
"New chain is pre-lubricated, should I clean it before use?","The coating is generally a form of wax, which is an excellent chain lube, and less apt to attract dirt than most chain oils.  All you really should do is wipe off (with a dry cloth) any excess.   If the wax seems excessively heavy you can add a little solvent to the cloth, to just wipe off the outer coating.  You want to leave the lube on the inside of the chain, where it's really needed."
Group riding etiquette,"There are a number of problems in your situation, including the behaviour of the groups, which I will breakdown as the following: Personally, I believe by far the biggest issue was with how the group was behaving, they can't expect some random person on a bike to be versed in group riding, and they forget that they are sharing road with other road users.  That said, as someone with a large number of years experience in group riding, I would have attempted to removed myself from that situation ahead of time by asking riders in the group to let me through so I could go straight or asked for guidance.  Expecting someone who is being overtaken to just pull over and stop is arrogant to say the least. Most people in that situation wouldn't have had that experience or necessarily known what to do;  however, there is still an element of personal responsibility as the OP allowed themselves to integrate into the group (likely because it made riding easier), without known what was really expected.   ""By virtue of the magic of drafting, by the time about ten riders were past me, I had no problem at all keeping pace"" It is clear that the OP was knowingly benefiting from some type of draft, which ultimately made it more difficult for the group to pass and prolonged the OP's exposure to the group. The OP made the decision to speed up, they could have easily kept their original speed (e.g., brakes) which would have allowed the group to pass quicker.  You can't get a free draft (or partial draft) allow yourself to be somewhat integrated into the group, then suddenly do what you want. Groups don't react well to sudden changes. That said, this is a relatively small transgression as most people suddenly finding themselves in this situation won't be thinking of these nuances. Rather, the onus is really on the large group doing the passing to make this work safely."
Are bananas still a good food to carry when cycling?,"There is an interesting Q&A on independent.co.uk (though it dates from 1995) talking about bananas and tennis... Q. Witnessing players at Wimbledon
  chomping their way through pounds of
  bananas between games prompts the
  question: who began this sporting food
  fad and are there sound nutritional
  reasons for the players' preference
  for bananas to other fruit or food. In
  what other sports (leaving aside lunch
  and tea breaks in cricket) do the
  participants eat during the course of
  play? A. The sporting fad for bananas was
  started by sports nutritionists such
  as myself. The banana is rich in
  carbohydrate - an important source of
  energy for athletes and has
  significantly higher levels than any
  other fruit. Also, unlike most other
  forms of high-carbohydrate foods, it
  contains very little fat but is also
  high in fibre. The combination of
  fibre with the banana's three natural
  sugars - fructose, sucrose and glucose
  - means it provides a sustained boost to flagging energy levels, thus so
  many players at Wimbledon were seen
  eating bananas. Bananas are also an excellent recovery
  food for replacing potassium lost in
  sweating, something most players must
  have been suffering from at this
  year's tournament. - Jane Griffin,
  Consultant Nutritionist to the British
  Olympic Association, London SW17 Sounds like it would be good for long bike rides as well."
What is the difference between folding bead and wire bead tires?,"Folding versus wire refers to the material within the bead or 'edge' of each side of the tire. Foldable bead tires use kevlar in most cases (I think) and tires with each type are entirely compatible with the rim size that the tire is designed for (in the absence of a manufacturing defect). Folding bead tires have a few advantages (in my opinion): For these advantages, you will probably pay more for a foldable bead tire when a tire model includes both options. Also, wire bead's also appear more often as the OEM tires on lower end bikes."
Why are both Schrader and Presta valves still used on tubes?,"The main thing is that the Presta valve is thinner, and takes less of a bite out of the rim.  This is quite important as the rims get narrower. Further, the Presta works better with hand pumps in that there's no spring that the pump needs to overcome to get air into the tire.  Also, the Presta always has the fully-threaded body (which is possible with Schrader, but rare), so a nut can be used to hold the valve in place -- again, quite important with hand pumps. Never had a bike valve stem break on me, that I can recall."
Why are emergency inflation cartridges filled with CO2?,"CO2 charger cartridges are used for bike tire inflation because they are a common, inexpensive product that has been around since the 1950s. Their other uses include powering air guns and inflating life vests. They were originally developed by the Crosman Corporation and marketed under the name ""Powerlet"". Powerlet cartridges are filled with CO2 presumably because it's the most suitable gas. Reasons I can think of are: Updates to my answer seeing as it popped back up on the main page for some reason. CO2 cartridges are not filled with compressed CO2, they are filled with liquid CO2. That has to be done to get enough of the stuff in the cartridge to be useful. The cartridge is not completely filled however, and the gas pressure in the space is essentially constant (the vapor pressure) as long as there is some liquid CO2 remaining. You can't put liquid air in a cartridge because it's comprised of nitrogen, oxygen, water vapor and CO2, all of which have different boiling points. In fact, C02 turns to a solid before nitrogen turns to a liquid. "
Is it safe to ride a racing road bike in very wet weather?,They're fine. I live outside of Vancouver so I'm already riding in wet a few days a week some weeks. Just this morning I was coming down the backside of a climb at 70km and they were totally secure. Since the tires are so narrow they don't suffer from hydroplaning. The biggest thing to worry about is painted lines and manhole covers (or other metal covers on the road). Both are very slick when wet. I've always been careful but I know a number of other riders that have gone down cornering hard on both types of surfaces. You're right to leave yourself extra room to brake. Also don't forget to account for reduced visibility for both you and cars.
What is the difference between a horizontal top tube and a sloped one?,"I thought this was an interesting question, so first of all, +1. First off, the sloping tube (your second image) is known in cycling parlance as a compact frame. I found an article on the Giant web site about the advantages of a compact frame. When I say ""advantages"" - this is Giant's word not mine! The full article is here, but to summarise it: Now I'll say straight away that you can attach your own weight to some of these features, this article has a whiff of marketing about it. But it certainly gives you some food for thought. Interesting also to note that Giant's current top-of-the-range mens' road bike (the Propel) has a standard frame (i.e. horizontal top tube). Take from that what you will! "
"What does the ""c"" in bicycle tire size mean?","It doesn't mean anything, really. It's a historical relic. At one point in time, ""700c"" was a standard tire/rim size, where ""c"" indicated the bead seat diameter and ""700"" was the diameter, in millimeters, when the tire was installed and inflated. That ""700c"" tire size has a 622 millimeter bead seat diameter. There's an ISO standard that's often listed in small print where those tires are all '25-622'. This is the same as ""29er"", though usually tires marketed that way are substantially wider. ""700"", ""622"" and ""29"" are really all the same size. All those tire sizes you list are the same.  If there were different prices for the ""700x25"" and the ""700x25c"", it's because there was some other difference between the tires, like model, threads per inch, bead type (wire or kevlar), etc..."
Does the chain direction make a difference?,"This Bicycle Repair Guide says: One- and three-speed bikes use
  1/8-inch wide chain, which use master
  links. There is one master link per
  bike chain. These snap on and off
  easily. There are two types of master
  links. Two-piece master links are
  opened by loosening the chain, then
  gently bending the link toward the
  outside, so the outer plate of the
  link is free to be lifted off.
  Three-piece master links have a clip
  that slides to one side and then lifts
  off. When reinstalling three-piece
  links, install the clip with the open
  end facing away from the direction of
  rotation, so that friction between the
  bike chain and clothing, chainguard,
  etc, will not accidentally remove it. It's also covered on Bike Forums, here's one of the answers: Chain direction matters if the chain
  is worn. If you remove and soak your
  chain regularly (which, by the way, is
  not recommended, regardless of how
  easy it is to remove the chain), then
  you won't have a problem regardless of
  orientation of chain. If you remove a
  well worn chain and install it in the
  reverse direction, you'll end up with
  a mysterious skip in your drivetrain.
  Reverse your chain to see if that's
  the cause. There are two exceptions - if the
  chain has an ""inside"", i.e. points to
  the cogs, and ""outside"", i.e. never
  contacts cogs, except the pulley of
  the rear derailleur. If you have such
  a chain, you'll need to make sure that
  the inside is inside. You can still
  reverse its direction though, unless
  it is also directional, i.e there is a
  left and a right (the second
  exception)."
What's the purpose of cycling gloves?,"Cycling gloves do a few basic things: Of course, if none of these are problems for you, it's fine to ride without them.  Other types of gloves should offer similar benefits too (wool gloves with ""grippy"" palms are nice in cold, wet weather).  I try to ride without cycling gloves for rides up to an hour to toughen my palms and reduce the bizarre tan lines the gloves create.  But for longer rides (especially randonneuring, which is 200km+) I can't ride without them. What else can you use them for?  Basically anything where a padded palm would help.  They make great workout gloves, and I've occasionally used a pair for paddling, doing yard work or helping someone move."
Why don't road bikes use v-brakes?,"A v-brake has too much stopping power for a road bike, and too little modulation. It requires significantly more contact patch, the rubber area of the tire which is in contact with the road at any given time, to maintain traction in a braking operation. A v-brake has too much power, and too little control of its power because of the linear design of the compression mechanism of the brake. If you managed to get the brake adjusted to work at all, it would cause the bike to skid immediately when the brakes were applied. In addition the traditional lever pull on a road brake lever uses a different ratio of lever throw to cable pull (1:1). A V-brake (or cable disc or cantilever) uses a 2:1 ratio, which means the lever would have to travel twice as far for the brake to touch the rim. The road brake lever would have to be redesigned. "
How to know when to change a chain?,"You can measure the stretch of a chain with a chain gauge (or just a ruler) 
 Alternately - the chain links are 1 inch long, so measure 12 of them with a ruler, if they are more than 1/8inch longer than this then they are worn. You need to do this before it wears the rear cogs - it will cause the teeth to wear into sharp pointed spikes = need a new cassette."
"Should I buy this (gently) used, 15 year old, helmet?","No. It is safety gear – buy a new one. The old helmet might make a good pot for a hanging plant but it is more likely to fail dramatically in your moment of need. The straps would probably come right with a soak in water, but the polystychrene is the functional part and it has failed with age.   It might fill a legal requirement if your location mandates helmet wearing, but it probably won't provide sufficient protection."
"I wish to get fit, therefore should I have a heavy bike?","I'm going to assume that your definition of ""get fit"" is to lose weight and develop aerobic fitness. I'm also going to assume that the person in question is rather unfit to begin with. All in all, a person can get fit (or not) on either a heavy or light bike; it will really depend on how they go about their fitness program.  To achieve aerobic or cardiovascular fitness one needs to engage in an activity that elevates the heart rate to a target zone and keep it there for periods of time. To lose weight, one must burn more energy (calories) than one consumes. In order to do this the activity needs to be done on a regular basis.  On to the weight of the bike... Say a person can choose either a 15lb road bike, a 25lb mountain bike, or a 35lb commuter bike for their fitness program. It makes absolutely no difference which bike they choose in order to lose weight and develop aerobic fitness. The only thing that matters will be how they use the bike. So to get fit, the choice of bike would depend more on the type of use a person desires rather than the weight of the bike. There are also drawbacks to choosing a heavier bike for the sake of it being heavier. One is that it would be harder on the knees of an unfit person, and even a fit person, if they have to climb hills. Another is that it's just plain harder to have to lug around. And also, it would be much less enjoyable once the person gets fit. My second job is working as a fitness trainer. If a client came to me wanting to get fit with cycling, I would not recommend that they get a 'heavy' bike. I would recommend that they get the best bike they can reasonably afford, based on the type of riding that they prefer to do. I would also probably recommend that they start out with steady, regular riding and build up to interval training. The question is about getting a heavy bike for fitness; and I'd say no, don't get a heavy bike for fitness. Get a bike that will be frequently ridden. As a trainer I've had several clients who turned to cycling for fitness reasons. One of them got an 'urban' bike decked out with fenders, rear rack, panniers, etc and proceeded to lose 30lbs and otherwise improve her fitness with a daily 16 mile RT commute, plus weekend fun rides. Another client went with an expensive, light road bike; he managed to burn off 25lbs, and 6 months later rode his first century. So, the weight of the bike shouldn't be the determining factor. Like others have said, it should be about the fun and enjoyment and finding a style of riding that'll be sustained. "
Is there such thing as an automatic transmission for bikes?,http://www.landriderbikes.com They were very heavily advertised several years ago but currently they seem to show up more on craigslist than on TV. 
How much do components really matter for a non-competitive rider?,"I assume that you're talking about road biking. I can give you my opinion after using these groups for a while: Shimano Sora, Shimano Tiagra, Shimano 105, and now a full Shimano Ultegra.  All work, when properly adjusted and when shifting correctly. You have to do your homework and know how to shift smoothly, and adjust the gears. Whoever tells you that something is ""not good"" or ""does not work"" is lying or wants you to expend money. But of course different levels are there for a reason: Weight: More expensive is lighter.
Stiffness: More expensive is stiffer, therefore transmitting your power better without loss of energy.
Ergonomics: More expensive groups tend to have a refined shape.
Reliability: More expensive groups tend to stay tuned longer than less expensive ones.
Shifting under pressure or more than one gear at the time: Expensive groups allow you to do it, cheaper ones don't.
Smoothness and speed: Shifting is faster and smoother on expensive groups. If you notice, I put smoothness and speed last. It is usually one of the reasons that people mention as being key, but in my experience proper adjustment and proper shifting technique are more important than the group. My bike with Sora/Tiagra shifts as smoothly as the Ultegra after adjustment. But the other reasons are important to many people. Even if they don't compete they may want a light, stiff, and reliable group that makes the experience of biking more pleasurable (although the real pleasure is riding, of course), and they are willing to pay for it. They are undoubtedly ""nicer"". Regarding durability, I'm skeptical about people's comments. Most of the times people change chains and cassettes because they are worn out, and upgrades/changes the rest of the group's components as new models appear, not necessarily because they don't ""last"". If you're a recreational rider, whatever you buy will ""last"" more than you will need.  I've seen 20 yr-old bikes that work perfectly, provided that the user changed the chain and cassette regularly. But remember durability and reliability are two different things. At which point is not worth expending more money? Difficult to tell, but here is my suggestion (take it as a suggestion and nothing more): Dura Ace or Sram Red if you compete.
Ultegra or Sram Force if you are an enthusiast that races or values to have a performance group.
105 or Sram Rival if you want a very nice recreational group.
Tiagra or Sram Apex if you want a solid recreational group.
Sora and below if you are a recreational rider that does not want to spend too much money. EDIT: I recently had the luxury of trying a bike with electronic shifting (a Shimano Ultegra Di2) and I would like to add to my answer that in this case, the hype is true. It is a true revolutionary thing. Expensive, very expensive. Worth it? Probably not. But really good, yes."
"Difference between Cyclocross, Touring, and Road Bikes?","Road bikes are designed for performance on (mostly) well paved roads. They are the lightest weight of the 3 categories, have the shortest wheelbase, lowest bottom bracket, and the steepest headtube angles. These geometry features allow the bike to react to rider inputs quickly and to have a low center of gravity which is beneficial when turning. Wheels are almost invariably 700c - sometimes smaller wheels are used on very small frames. Tire sizes will typically vary from 20-25mm width but the most common width is 23mm, thus the 700x23 that you'll often see. Road frames can be made out of just about any material but the most common ones that you'll see are aluminum for budget oriented bikes and carbon fiber for high end bikes. Gearing will be the highest and narrowest on this type of bike. Road bikes are designed to carry the rider and his/her water bottles and not much else, although some are drilled for fitting racks - usually on the less expensive side. Road bikes still make great commuters if you want a light weight, fast reacting machine to get from point A to point B. Touring bikes are designed for long, multi-day excursions on the road. They are usually the heaviest bikes of the bunch as they are built for durability and to carry a lot of stuff beyond just the rider. They will maintain a relatively low bottom bracket but the wheelbase will be longer and the head tube angle slacker when compared to a road bike. This adds to their stability, especially when fully loaded. Wheels are often 700c but many are actually designed for 26"" - some will accept either, though this will make for a higher BB with the larger wheel. Stock tire sizes will run wider - usually 28mm or above. This makes of a more comfortable ride since the air pressure can be dropped. You may see touring bikes made from other materials, but the most common is steel due to its forgiving nature and durability. Drillings for back and front racks are standard, and drillings for extra water bottles are common. Gearing may be a little lower, but will certainly be wider on a touring bike. Sometimes mountain bike components are used for rear gearing to give the rider extra low gearing. This is very welcome when ascending with a fully loaded touring bike. This type of bike makes an excellent commuter as it is stable and when fitter with racks/panniers gives you lots of places to put your stuff besides on your back. Cyclocross bikes are designed to travel both on and off road. Cyclocross is actually a race discipline that evolved as something for road racers to do in the off season, but the bikes have become very popular outside of racing due to their versatility. Cross bikes will typically be heavier than a comparable road bike but lighter than a comparable touring bike. The wheelbase will be in between that of a road bike and a touring bike while the bottom bracket height and headtube angle could be on either side of that of a touring bike depending on the manufacturer's philosophy. Wheels will be 700c and tires will typically range somewhere in the 30-40mm width range with small knobs to grip loose surfaces as opposed to the slicks you'll see on dedicated road tires. Frame materials vary widely just as with the other bike types, but for high end cyclocross frames carbon fiber is becoming a more prevalent material. Aluminum and steel are also common, especially amongst mid level bikes and below. Traditional cyclocross gearing is a little odd as they typically come with a very close ratio double crankset but this may be compensated for by a wider cassette. Race dedicated cyclocross bikes may have drillings for water bottle cages in the front triangle though you'll often see them with no bottles mounted so they don't get in the way of shouldering the bike over obstacles. On the other hand, many cross bikes are drilled for racks since they can double as a touring bike due to the similar geometry. Cross bikes make wonderful commuters due to their versatility and durability. You can often run racks or not, and swap the knobby tires with slicks should you so choose."
What should I look for in a good pair of cycling shorts?,"First you need to work out what sort of cycle shorts you are looking for: Now, what are the features that you are looking for in good quality bike shorts:"
Perfectly setting up gears - how?,"The first rule is make sure the rear derailleur is adjusted correctly before adjusting the front derailleur. There are three adjustments that you can do on the front derailleur: Clamp Position Here you can adjust the height of the derailleur, normally this is recommended as a 2mm clearance between the bottom of the outer cage and the teeth of the large chainring.  Picture from bicycletutor.com site You can also adjust the rotational angle of the derailleur.  Picture from Parktool site Limit stops The Limit stops are for adjusting the inward and outward travel of the front derailleur. Limit stops are marked ""L"" for Low and ""H"" for High. The L-stop will stop the movement of the derailleur toward the smallest chainring. The H-stop will stop the movement of the derailleur toward the largest chainring. There is a good guide on the Parktool site that gives a lot of detail on adjusting the front derailleur."
How can you recognise a quality steel frame?,"Some things differ if you are looking at a new or a used frame, but here are some suggestions: First, when you say you are looking for a steel frame, what you probably mean is a ChroMoly Steel alloy frame.  This would be a frame made from tubes where chromium and molybdenum  were added as the steel was refined.  Frequently you will see a sticker on the tube with a number like 531, 631, 725 or 853 which is used to describe the particular blend. Second, spotting a high or low quality frame has become more difficult over the years as machining and welding techniques have filtered down. With older frames you definitely want to look at the quality of the welds and brazing, as well as the paint.  Welds may be smooth, or have a regular pattern.  Watch out for welds that look rough, 'globby' or irregular.  It used to be that the use of lugs was a hallmark of lower quality frames, but today you see them more often on high end boutique or custom touring frames. You may also want to feel the bottom sides of the tubes for a ""seam"".  On older low quality frames you frequently find rolled tubes, where the steel was a flat sheet that was then rolled and welded length-wise. Finally, the durability of a steel frame is largely a function of the paint quality and maintenance. Water and rust are the primary enemies of a steel frame.  If buying used you will want to closely inspect the area around the bottom bracket, dropouts, and the whole underside of the bike for chips, cracks and visible rust.  For long life, as well as the low environmental cost, steel v. aluminum is probably a wash.  In the US and most the developed countries both aluminum and steel recycling is around 50% and the production costs and impacts are pretty similar.  And while corrosion may be an issue, an aluminum frame won't rust. Good Luck."
"What is the ""preload"" setting on the front fork suspension?","This fork setting exists so that the fork can be customized to your weight (major reason) and riding style (minor reason). It's simply the initial compression of the internal spring in the fork. The more it's compressed, the stiffer the fork will feel. Bigger preload compresses the spring more, and so it's best for heavier riders and/or people who need/prefer the stiffer ride (racers etc.)  Lighter riders should use less(-) preload. Less(-) preload will also give you plusher ride, but the bike will e.g. dive more during braking. Source: http://bicyclethailand.com/setting-the-sag-on-mtb-suspension-forks/"
Threatening swerving by driver - should I report it? (Canada),"I also live in Ottawa so I can provide some pertinent viewpoints.  Yes, you should report it, and yes, it will probably be an exercise in frustration. Don't expect the police to do anything about it. However, you should report it anyway, it might end up in a database somewhere and give them another data point about why it's important to build more cycle lanes and increase driver education on the issue of cyclists.  If they notice a trend of complaints against the same vehicle, perhaps they will be able to do something about it. A little anecdote.  I once saw a car ram into the back of another guy's car at a stop light. The driver in question fled the scene. I was able to catch the license plate as I was walking down the sidewalk at the time of the accident.  Even though the police were able to find the car, and identify that indeed it matched the description and damage, they were unable to press charges for fleeing the scene because the owner of the car claimed he wasn't driving, and the police therefore didn't have enough evidence to actually issue a ticket or charge the suspected driver. Without video evidence, there is probably little they can do to actually issue a ticket.   If you are uncomfortable making this turn because of the high amount of traffic and because of incidents like this. You can just head straight on Rideau across the intersection and then wait for the light to change and then go straight across Sussex.  This will avoid a lot of traffic and won't add much extra time to your commute.  You might even possibly avoid issues like this in the future.  It's not great that cyclists have to ride so defensively, but it's better to be safe than sorry. Hopefully this situation won't turn you off cycling. I've found that most of the drivers in the city give quite a bit of room to cyclists, but there are always bad apples in the bunch. One last point, if you want to ride the city without having to deal with traffic, check out the CN Cycle for CHEO. You got 2 weeks to get ready, and it's a great way to see the city and help a worthy cause."
How do I open a master link in a chain?,"I use a tool made out of a steel wire clotheshanger to squeeze the two pins together and open the link.  Also, that one hanger turned into three tools: the link opener, a tool to hold the ends of an open chain together, and one to hang the cleaned-and-drying chain from the tree over the driveway. "
New to bicycle riding. Questions about adjustments and upgrades,"I am  going to echo some of the current answers a bit, but I have a tiny bit to add.  First, I tend to agree with those that say, ""save your money for a new bike, don't upgrade your current one"". A good bike can be bought for around $400. Maybe a bit less, maybe a bit more. It all depends. But the truth is you don't even know what you want in a bike. Take the time now to learn that. Now I set the $400 price point based on my region obviously. But for a normal, casual rider, there comes a point of diminishing returns. Yes, a $400 bike is going to be a lot better than your $75 bike. But unless you're really serious, an $800 one is not going to feel much different than one that cost $400 (there are differences, but they usually don't matter). When you do go to buy a bike, go to a local bike shop. They will know how to set you up (hopefully). They should measure your inseam, your arm length, and height (and maybe some other measurements), then suggest to you the right size bike.  Regardless of whether you're upgrading or buying a new bike, here are the important things to look for (for your comfort)."
Does toddler need a helmet inside a bicycle trailer?,"Generally helmets are recommended for carrier usage by manufacturers and governing bodies, although local cultural practices may vary depending on perceived risks.  Helmets are recommended because it is still possible to crash or even roll a trailer, just as it is possible to crash on a bicycle, even if you are riding slowly and in quiet areas. While children should be wearing seat belts within the carrier/trailer, the structures would not provide adequate protection against head injuries, making helmets the last line of defense against a head injury in the case of a crash."
How to keep my testicles from freezing on a recumbent,"First: merino wool boxers. EDIT: Also windproof boxers, see other answer below Second: Vest and short tights are very little for ~5°C, raining. You are losing a huge amount of body heat through your arms and legs, and this leaves little for body parts without active muscles. Wear more, and your balls will be warmer too."
Why do bike tires suffer from frequent punctures whereas car tires don't?,"The main reason is that bicycle tyres are much, much thinner than car tyres. A little tetrahedron of broken glass or a drawing pin that would puncture both tyre and tube on a bicycle won't trouble a car's tyre in the slightest. A secondary reason is that bicycle tyres with tubes have additional ways to suffer punctures: an under-inflated tyre is susceptible to pinch flats. It's pretty much as simple as that."
Bike shop did too much work on my bike - do I need to pick it up?,"Law Stack Exchange could surely help you from a consumer law perspective. The New York Times’ ethicist column or similar could also advise. However, from a cycling perspective, I would expect a bike shop to know the relative value of the bicycle compared to what it would take to get it running. I would expect them to call the consumer if the bike was going to take a lot more work or cost a lot more than expected. I believe this is a common expectation. They definitely failed on this score. If the bike were sitting outside for a year, then unfortunately, the amount of damage described is plausible. The seatpost and the BB being seized is expected. I would actually expect anything with bearings plus the chain to be badly damaged and possibly uneconomical to just service, meaning that the headset was probably also involved. I would assume all cables and housing needed replacement. Furthermore, the frame might have internal rust, which can cause a frame failure if it’s bad enough. Continuous exposure to wet weather is truly evil. Thus, we always counsel strongly against simply leaving a bike outside. They aren’t cars. If we built bikes to be as weatherproof as cars are, they would weigh a lot more and would be a lot less fun to ride! A reasonable mechanic should know that an average Trek road bike from the 1990s isn’t objectively that valuable. I wonder if you heard correctly that they absolutely needed to get a $250 replacement square taper BB, but if so, that should objectively have raised a red flag with the mechanic to call the customer. I’ve not worked in a bike store, but 12 hours of labor does sound like a lot. If the mechanic realized the bike needed that long, they should once again have checked in. If you didn’t tell them the bike was stored outside for a long time, you should have, but that doesn’t excuse their failure. An experienced mechanic should have inferred the general condition of the bike if they disassembled one of the hubs. As a counterpoint, watch this vid from Berm Peak Express. This was a prank, but he had a fake customer bring a top of the line SRAM wireless MTB group to get installed on a very cheap (I think department store quality, but definitely very dated suspension design) bike. The mechanic said he would check for compatibility, and call the customer. He did exactly that after seeing that the components were indeed compatible, and also asked about some other minor jobs that the bike could use. And this did involve a judgment of economic value, because the chain alone retailed for about what you paid for your bike. Hence, a shop should have called. I believe similar norms operate in automobile repair shops. It definitely wouldn’t be nice to abandon the bike, but I expect a lot of people in this situation wouldn’t pick the bike up. Surely the shop would have thought about this?? I don’t know the exact legal issues, but there is a branch of law dealing with property abandoned at a business by customers. The shop may be required to retain the property for a short time, but eventually they could probably sell the bicycle if they can (but it’s unlikely they would get back $850). I am not sure what you owe the shop ethically, and I didn’t initially discuss it. Bike shops run on tight margins. I endorse the other answers saying that you should talk to the manager; I argue this was a significant failure on their part. I think it is not ethically optimal to simply walk away, but if the events were correctly described, the shop does need to be informed that they didn’t handle this well. Your leverage is that you can walk away and be out $100. One thing I really get hung up on is the $250 ceramic BB. This places the BB in premium pricing territory, of the sort you’d put on a top end bike. There are a whole bunch of cheap but perfectly durable square taper BBs from Shimano or from less known manufacturers. (Previously, I made an assertion about Phil Wood BBs, which are a very well-regarded premium option, being considerably cheaper. Phil’s prices have come up since I last remembered, but they are still somewhat cheaper; the steel spindle standard bearing versions are about US$175, plus you buy the cups separately.) Naturally, if you actually want a ceramic BB for your older Trek, you should not let social convention stop you. But again, it was an objectively strange choice to make on behalf of the customer."
Tactics for riding in strong winds,"The answer to this question is different if you are going on a long-distance tour rather than going-to-work-and-back. If on tour and facing the prospect of a struggle to do 30 miles when you really wanted to get 100 miles in (e.g. to get to next camp-site) it can be a better idea to not bother, sit out the wind and have a go later that day/evening or the next day. It is also important to understand weather a little bit. The air in a valley will heat up on a sunny day and, as that air expands, it has to go somewhere. This can lead to a tough headwind instead of an easy down-hill ride when going into the valley. This process works in reverse, so, if planning a long distance ride and crossing valley systems it can be best to book a room in the town at the bottom of the valley rather than pitch a camp at the campsite near the top of the mountain pass. Weather generally is more active during the day than at night so the best times for avoiding wind in a known windy place are early mornings and night. Clearly this does not help if you are doing 9-5 but if you are doing other shift patterns then you might be able to choose your shifts so as to get a near-guaranteed tailwind in both directions, to work and to home. If you have to ride into headwinds there are a few things you can do: Think of wind as water and imagine where the 'river of wind' is going to be slowest. in the middle of the road the wind will not be slowed down, by the edges it will be slower, albeit marginally. Hence, try to ride safe-yet-close to available fences and walls. in that way you will 'not be swept away by the current'. The sea also has an effect on wind - if following a coastal route try to find a route further inland. The sea heats up differently to the land, this will have seasonal affects on prevailing wind direction. Also bear in mind that most winds are from the west due to the turning of the planet.  Try to be as aero as possible - keep your elbows in.
it may not be full-aero-tuck, but, elbows in will make a difference to your overall drag. You can also hold your handlebars a bit more in-board than you would do otherwise. Roll with the punches. If there is a gust of wind that is going to stop you in your tracks then you can ease up and put your pedal effort in when the gust has passed by. Make sure you are not wearing a big balloon. A skirt or a coat can act like a giant parachute - not what you need. Much like how a parachute has a hole in the top to let the air out without undue turbulent effects, make sure your coat has an exit hole for the air driven in through the front. Be seated. When out of the saddle you present a bigger frontal area. Use your gears rather than getting out of the saddle to get your momentum up. Sit low. Tiredness helps to 'fall over the bars' and have a flat back. Pretend you have been riding all day and adopt the flattened pose that you get then, with your legs spinning and your upper body relaxed. Draft anything you can - other cyclists, motor vehicles such as buses pulling out can give small bits of aero benefit. If the problem is persistent on your route consider getting a 20"" wheel folding bike. This will have better aerodynamics than your MTB/hybrid, you can also fold it up and take the bus/train as far as you can towards your destination. Also consider a saddlebag rather than a rucksack/panniers as saddlebags are the most aero bag option. If the headwinds are always against you and your job matters more than your home, consider moving to the other side of town so your commute is with the prevailing winds rather than against them."
Theft deterrents (in addition to locking up a bike),"In addition to locking your bike securely with a good lock, there are several strategies you can use: Where you lock up can be nearly as important as how well you're locked up. If you're in a public, well-lit area, a thief might think twice about stealing a bike. A rack in an isolated, dark area may look more attractive to steal -- there aren't as many potential witnesses. While some may not have a choice in this matter, if you know you'll have to lock up in a sketchy neighborhood fairly often, you might consider getting a cheap, used mountain bike if possible. Save the flashy carbon expensive-looking bike for club rides and longer road rides. There may be situations where you don't have to lock the bike up. Many supermarkets and big box stores will let you take the bike with you, if the aisles are roomy. Take care to stay out of the way of other customers. If asked to take the bike outside, you can either comply with the request or take your business elsewhere, but be nice about it either way. Folding bikes are great for this, especially when you can fit the bike into a shopping cart. I've heard it said that you just need to lock up your bike better than the next bike in the rack. That may or may not be true, but consider making your bike uglier than the bike next to it. A terrible rattle-can paint job (i.e., spray painted) will make a nice bike look like a jalopy of a ride. You can also approximate this by putting a plastic grocery bag over the saddle, using ugly/old bar tape, fenders that are scratched up, and so on. Wheels and saddles with quick-release hardware are a target for thieves. Much of this can be combatted by locking them up properly (feed a cable through the saddle rails or the spokes of the wheels), but consider replacing these with hardware that needs a tool to open. Maintenance will take longer, but locking up (and unlocking) will be quicker."
How to lubricate cables?,"I use chain lube since I also prefer the solvent+grease wet chain lubes. That's exactly what you want inside cable housings. Popping the quick releases on brakes or frame attachments on gear cables, then dribbling chain lube along the inner so it runs down into the outer works well on cables that are already installed and doesn't require re-adjusting anything afterwards. Many outers are pre-greased these days, and the way to fake that if you get cheaper outers is a grease gun. A syringe will work at a pinch, but it needs to be a small one or the force needed to squirt grease into the tiny hole in the outer will be extremely high. Trying to manipulate grease into a cable outer any other way is frustrating and I find it ineffective (I have tried!) Using oil kind of works, but I find I need to re-oil the cables way too often. Grease works better. Teflon coated cables work even better, and the combo of teflon cables and pre-greased outers (or plastic-lined outers) is amazing. But not worth the $80 a set unless you're running 10 speed gears or something expensive (I use a Rohloff, and that doesn't care about fine adjustment, only cable friction)."
How to get a bike from one city to another in the U.S,"I've never shipped a bike, but I moved from Canada to Europe with my Surly Cross-check in a box last year. When the box came off the plane it looked like it had been run over by a truck and left out in the rain, but the contents of the box were 100% undamaged. Hold on to your pants, this is gonna be long! Shipping a bike is cheap and easy, but make sure to do it right.  As I'm sure you have found out airlines require you to have your bike in a box or a case. Cases are expensive. Most bikes are shipped to bike stores in a cardboard box in various stages of assembly from just a frame to a full bike with some parts removed for transport. When they unpack new bikes they have to get rid of the boxes so hopefully you can find a nice store that will give you one for free or sell you one really cheap, like 10 bucks or less. If bike stores are no luck then furniture and appliance stores and bed stores like Sleep Country are great sources of large, strong, and free cardboard boxes and large strong plastic mattress bags, both of which you'll need. These stores are also usually overflowing with bubble wrap, styrofoam peanuts, little air filled plastic bags, and all sorts of other packing materials and are usually willing to give the stuff away if you want to root through the dumpster. Also recycling depots are always overloaded with cardboard, all free. Just think creatively and you should be able to find all the materials you will need for free in our mega-packaged and plasticized world. So here's how (I think) you should pack your bike: Materials List Large strong cardboard box that will either fit your bike or can be easily cut and folded to make the right size box. Mattress boxes, fridge boxes, and large flat screen tv boxes are perfect. Just try to choose a box that is as long as your bike plus a couple of feet, and as tall as your bike plus a couple of feet, so you can have plenty of room to fold over the ends, top, and bottom. Just think of how you would size up a piece of wrapping paper before wrapping a present. I hope you are good at wrapping presents. More flexible (but still corrugated) cardboard that you can roll like Xerox paper box type cardboard. Lots of newspaper, bubble wrap, styro-wrap... whatever you can scrounge for padding and space filler. Plastic shopping bags make great padding and can usually be had by the thousands from friends who would love to get rid of the bags of bags they have in their hall closets or kitchen drawers. Several rolls of 2"" clear packing tape. Usually sold by the 6 pack pretty cheap or else sold per roll for the small price of an arm and leg at the UPS store, post offices, U-haul and other 'specialty' packing stores. good box knife and/or good scissors Procedure Bike preparation: You have three options:
a) leave the wheels on the frame and make a box big enough for the whole bike, or 
b) remove the wheels and package them in a separate box, or
c) a combo of the two, which is what I did (remove front wheel, leave rear wheel on and pack it all in one box).  Check with the airline for fees per box and weight restrictions on the boxes to decide. remove pedals (and crank arms if you wish to package them separately but this isn't necessary IMO) release the tension on your cables but leave them attached, so basically just crack the nut so the cable is for sure slack and then re-tighten gently to just hold the cable there. You mention this is a fixie so likely no shifter cables but maybe a brake cable, maybe not. loosen stem and turn handlebars 90 degrees to they are parallel to your top tube. If you have drop bars or aero bars you may want to remove them all together, they can be placed inside the triangle of your frame when you pack the bike, but if you have any cables it is easier to leave them on the stem. push seat post down into tube all the way but leave the seat on the bike, it is a good spacer against side impacts. air down your tires but leave them spongy enough that you could just ride them. This will allow them to expand and contract during the flight but keep them seated on the rim during packing and transport Padding I am going to assume you are using one box but if you decide to ship the wheels separately then just don't put them back on the frame. remove wheels using the more flexible cardboard cut a strip the width of your top tube and long enough to go around a couple of layers thick. Roll the cardboard around the tube firmly and tape in place, tabs are sufficient but you can wrap right around with the tape if you wish. Don't be stingy with the layers, put three layers if you want, make sure the cardboard goes right to the butt joints at either end. repeat this process for the down tube, seat tube, stays and fork arms. Basically just cover all the long and delicate parts of your bike with a nice thick roll of cardboard. If you are putting your wheels back on the frame make sure you leave enough space so they can fit back on, depending on how thick your cardboard is maybe you'll only get one or two layers on the stays and forks. do a similar wrap on your handlebars and cranks but use bubble wrap if you have some, or just a few sheets of newspaper. Hold in place with a tab of tape. bubble or newspaper wrap other exposed sections of the bike if you wish such as brakes, stem, tube junctions replace your wheels and tighten them on firmly. They should fit snugly between the cardboard padding. if you managed to get a hold of a good solid plastic mattress bag (double or queen should do) then I would bag the bike and tape it shut. If for some unknown reason the box is left out in the rain or snow, or something in the luggage gets all over it you have an extra layer of protection. After this your bike should be pretty well padded, time to put it in a box or build a box around it. Boxing Float like a butterfly and sting like a bee, stick and jab... oh right, cycling. This kind of depends on whether you have a bike or mattress box that is already close to the right size and whether you are leaving your wheels on or not. I will assume you are building a custom box and leaving the wheels on. IF YOU ARE TAKING YOUR WHEELS OFF, PUT A SPACER of some kind between your forks and stays where the axle would be to keep them from getting squished together if the box is compressed for some reason.  ALSO - MAKE SURE YOU EITHER REMOVE AND/OR PUT A BLOCK, SPACER, OR SOME KIND OF PADDING around your rear derailleur (if you have one, fixie riders can ignore this bit), otherwise you risk having it broken or damaged by careless airline tossers. A block of wood like a piece of broomstick taped in place works fine, or perhaps you have (buy or scrounge from an old bike) a couple of solid axles that you can just pop into the dropouts, with one set of nuts inside the fork screwed out gently against the fork and the other on the outside screwed in gently against the fork, sandwiching the forks/stays in place. Scenario 1 - you have a mattress box or bike box that is the right height and length and just need to drop the bike into it. layer the bottom with a mass of firmly balled newspaper lower the bike into the box starting at the bottom pad around the wheels until the bike will free stand in the box. Firmly balled newspaper or bubble wrap is best. once the bike is standing nicely you can begin to fill the rest of the space. Styro peanuts, those air filled spacer bags, and bubble wrap are great for this. Loosely balled newspaper is excellent padding too. If your bike is in a clean(ish) plastic bag then extra clothing is good padding and space filler, and might cut down on the size of your checked luggage or carry on. Bulky items like jackets and pants for example. Or put your clothes in bags as well perhaps. if you have removed the handlebars now is the time to place them in the triangular space and fill around them with packing. bike parts that you have taken off such as pedals and cranks can be wrapped and places strategically in the empty spaces. Bike tools (to put it back together), tire pump, helmet, and other accessories can also be wrapped and used to fill the space. When the box is full of packing to the top, close the top flaps and tape every single edge and seam closed. More on this later Scenario 2 - you have a large box like a fridge box or mattress box that is way too big and you need to custom make a box. measure how wide your bike is at its wides point, usually the BB or handlebars cut the box along one corner so that it can unfold and lay flat on the floor. Choose the largest side and lay the bike on its side on top of the box leaving enough room so that the top parts of your bike (seat and handlebars or stem) are below the top edge of the box by the WIDTH of your bike PLUS 4 inches. You are going to fold the top of the box over eventually and this much space will allow you to fold the top over completely making the box wide enough for your bike with 2 inches of space on either side of its widest point. Mark a line across the box at the level of your tallest part. This is where you will fold the box to make the top. make similar measurements and mark lines on the box where you will make folds for the bottom, and then for the top again, cut off any excess cardboard. Don't worry about the length yet, you just want to wrap around the bike first. Creasing and folding these large strong boxes can be difficult to do in a straight line. One way is to pick the box up on edge and use the corner of one of your walls as a straight edge. Stand the box up flat against one wall with the line against the corner and fold the box around the corner. This should give you a good fold and not take too much effort. If you have a big table or long counter top you could use that too. make all your folds so that you have a box with open ends and an open top. once the box is folded it should be easy to mark, cut and fold the end flaps and then tape them shut so that you can lower the bike into your new box. I recommend making all of your top flaps and end flaps the full width of the box. This makes each end a double layer of cardboard and also makes taping the edges together much easier because you can just butt the folds together and tape tightly. True, the sides and bottom are still a single layer but... meh. So now you have made a box just the right size for your bike with the top flaps still open. Proceed as above under Scenario 1. A Note on Taping Here's how I tape closed a box that I want to be strong and secure for shipping. close your flaps and use tabs (4-6 inch long strips of tape) to firmly hold them together. For a bike sized box I would have at least 6 tabs on each end. once an end is made, tape each corner along its length with two strips of tape, first off setting the tape slightly to one side, and then to the other. Lay the tape strip lengthwise along the edge and then fold it over, off set to the other side and repeat. This gives each corner a double layer of tape. once the top is closed and the flaps are secured as I just described I would now tape right around the box 3 or four times. To go from top, down the side, under the bottom, up the other side, and across the top again. Three or four strips evenly spaced. Do the same from end to end 2 times as well. if any of the seams or corners still seem weak at this point, tape the heck out of them. Labeling Check with the airline again regarding any restrictions (or requirements) on labeling but I put my name on the box in big black sharpie as well a safe 'return' address. At least if the bike got lost it would get back to my folks place and I could have it shipped again. If you know your destination address then put it on there too, kind of like you would address an envelope. Add labels like 'This End Up' with arrows or 'Do Not Lay Flat' to keep the box upright so they won't lay it flat and pile stuff on top of it. 'Do Not Squish'
'Do Not Bend'
'Fragile' may also be useful. Well, that's all I can think of. If your bike gets damaged after packing it this securely then I think you will have a pretty good insurance case against the airline. Oh and on that note get insurance on the bike for the trip, possibly through the airline, and take pictures of the bike during various stages of packing to prove your efforts and show that it's really yours. Paranoid enough? Good luck and Bon Voyage! ps. If you're traveling with the bike, remember to pack the tools needed to put your bike back together."
Any experience with shaft driven bikes?,"I own & ride an XDS COM10 2014 bike. This is fitted with a Sussex (Taiwan) shaft drive transmission & Shimano Nexus 8 speed hub gear. I have used it regularly for over a year & travelled about 4000km on it without any issues . It works perfectly, smooth  & quiet.I thought it was very reasonably priced at about AUD700 brand new on-line.
It is very similar to ride as a Trek S500 2007 Nexus 8 speed chain drive bike I own, only without the chain maintenance. I intend to fit it with Shimano Roller brakes like the Trek S500 which would make it about as maintenance free as one could get with a bike. Downside would be the proprietary nature of the shaft drive system but it appears to be a high quality product & I think it will be durable But I didn't pay that much for the bike anyway & bought it because of the unique factor. The front drive is totally sealed, the rear drive well protected & both are well lubricated. It is the same system used for more than 20 years by Dynamic Bicycles USA.
Removing/replacing the rear wheel is easy & easier than the chain drive Trek bike. I note that there is plenty of negative opinion about this type of bike but it seems to come from people who have not actually experienced using them, which is disappointing as I think they have a lot going for them for recreational/commuting use, as do internal hub gear bikes in general. It works for me !"
How can I check tire pressure without a pressure gauge?,"Unless you have got correctly inflated tyres then you do not know what you are missing. No rule of thumb can make up for this. Tyre inflation is really important and your best bet is to get a track pump with valve to check your tyres with. Do this every fortnight, leave it to every month if your journey times are not important to you. I cannot stress enough the importance of getting a track pump, however, that is not what you asked. Several answers here have mentioned that you should take a peek at how much your tyres splay when you are riding the bike. This is definitely a useful check, however you must bear in mind that a correctly inflated tyre is not a solid tyre and it will bulge out sideways anyway. Only when drastically under-inflated will it show an easily discernible extra bulge. But do watch for that, particularly if you go over a bump and the bike 'thuds' more than normal. There is also the ride-through-the-puddle test. Go through a puddle and onto a dry surface, e.g. a pavement or a hallway. If you look at how much water has been left behind you can get a comparative idea of how much of your tyre is in contact with the road. If you know what you expect and if the trail is thicker than that, e.g. with a lot more than the centre ridge making contact, then you may want to get the track pump out again. Returning to the weight-on-the-wheel and how much the tyres splay idea, you can also roll your bike slowly over a kerb and see how much it deforms. At speed it will do so more than under the static situation, so try it slowly and there should be no danger to your rims and 'snake-biting' your tyres. As for squeezing the tyre after inflating it as best as I can with a mini-pump, when I get to the track pump with gauge I am always surprised at how many tens of P.S.I. I was off the mark. Squeezing the tyre is a waste of time. If you had car-type valves (which you don't) then you could get those valve caps that some car-part shops sell. These go red when you lose 5-10 P.S.I. They are good but not available in Presta to my knowledge. Personally I find the best gauge to be how the bike feels and how fast it goes. On some parts of my commute I like to go quicker than the 20 m.p.h. speed limit (as cars cannot over take me then), however, there are times when I am not able to hit my expected speeds, as measured on the bike speedometer. With a bit of extra air in the tyres I can usually get back to where I expect to be."
How to choose a bike for a very tall and heavy person?,"At 480lb/220kg: It would be easy to waste money by getting something too basic, but hopefully the above gives you some ideas for how to get into something functional without spending a ton."
How can I be visible in the dark when I'm signalling a turn?,"I should imagine you should be looking for some reflective gloves. Or even some glo gloves
Check these out as an example ...
http://lifehacker.com/395978/glo-gloves-reflective-cycling-gear Also using a good reflective jacket that has good reflective strips down the arms is useful."
What's your most useful cycle accessory?,"Fenders/Mudguards - front and back.  I ride all through winter and these help keep me dry. There's usually only one or two dozen times a year that I'm really riding in the rain for my morning or afternoon commute, but there's a good 3 or 4 months where rain comes through often enough that I'm riding through a lot of puddles.The rear fender prevents the classic skunk stripe, while the front fender primarily prevents splashing onto my feet and ankles. These also help keep your bike clean and should help increase the lifetime of your chain/gears (or at least give you an extra few days before it's time to clean and lubricate everything when riding in winter). I don't remember the exact model, but they're basically these fenders from Planet Bike that include a mud flap. "
I am a beginner to commuting by bike and I find it very tiring. Is it my fitness level or my single-speed bicycle?,"Was going to comment, but I'll make this an answer - it's the bike, not you. No, I really do mean it's the bike..... The bike as a fixie with 48/19 gearing is suitable for a cycle fit 20-something year old hipster with great knees now and a good health insurance plan for future orthopedic consultations.  Installing the freewheel helps make it more versatile, but 48/19 is still a big gear for a novice rider to push. You should be riding at at least about 13mph on that gear - any less and your cadence is too low and will cause the muscle burn you feel and make the bike feel 'sluggish'. On that bike, an average, no-cycle fit 39yo will almost certainly not enjoy cycling and give up.  Your base fitness will help a little to start with when riding, but you are not cycle fit. Your legs are not used to the motion and you use different muscles. The body needs time to adapt to the new exercise pattern, yet that bike does not allow you to do so progressively. You may be able to improve the bike by improving the fit (a professional fitter can help a lot here), but ultimately the bike is not the right bike for the task you have purchased it for."
What can you do when a driver cuts you off?,"Ride like every driver is a psychopath who hates cyclists; you will be wrong 95% of the time. What if the driver who just cut you off is one of the 5% and has a knife (US == gun)? It’s easier said than done (and not always possible). I have learnt the best approach is swear quietly to myself a few times, take a deep breath and keep riding. Avoiding becoming a road statistic is more important that any response. The unhurt and undamaged bike state is precious and any other action puts this at risk, especially a heat of moment response. Anger can often be calmed with a few simple questions to yourself. Are my expectations reasonable? ... 
Am I angry at the right person? ... 
Is my anger getting me what I want? ... 
Is my anger out of proportion to the offense? ... 
Do I have an effective response. Best case confronting the driver is it elicits an apology and a recognition from you it was a driver error with no malice intended. Worst case is violent road rage and you get a file number and become a police statistic. As already said in comments, cameras can make a huge difference. Knowing you have recorded evidence means you can ride on knowing you can report the driving later. If you decide (against my advice, but your choice) to confront the driver, cameras recording the interaction may be useful later."
How to climb a hill as a beginner,"The gearing of your bike seems reasonable, the 26 front/34 rear combination will (eventually) make climbing hills easy. But till then… Before you do anything else, take @cherouvim's advice and make sure you seat is at a reasonable height. It should be high enough that if you place a heel on the low pedal your leg is almost fully extended (just short of locked). From there you can fiddle around a bit with the height. Ultimately the seat should be as high as you can get it without needing to rock your hips as you pedal. If your seat is too low climbing will be really hard! The first question I'd ask is what happens when you run out of steam climbing the hill? Are your legs aching and burning or are you breathing really hard? The reason that I ask is that the different answers point to different immediate problems and possible solutions. If you're legs are burning, it's a good bet that you're not using a low enough gear. In this case, try shifting to a low gear much earlier in the climb, let your feet ""spin"" on the pedals. You'll slow down, but the climb should be much easier if you do this. On the other hand, if you're breathing super hard, you may be spinning too fast. It may seem counter-intuitive at first, but it may help to use a slightly higher gear, but I'd still make sure that you're starting the climb in a relatively easy gear. As other's have said, I don't think it be too long before you notice that you are doing much better on the hill. I live in a relatively hilly part of the US and a similar situation to you. I was out of shape from years of sedentary work and infrequent riding. So the final things I want to suggest are ideas for keeping going until better fitness kicks in (I think we're talking weeks, not months): Pedaling faster (at a higher cadence) in a low gear is usually easier than pushing harder in a higher gear. There was a good answer a while back that explained nicely how to find a good cadence for you. I'll see if I can find it and link to it. Choose a strategy for the hill that seems to work for you (really any strategy, just some idea about what you want to try). Having a strategy will make it easier to see if you're making progress and it will also help you identify what to do differently if it feels too hard (e.g., legs really burning? try a lower gear). One idea I'd suggest is to try starting in a lowish, but not your lowest, gear – for me it is very comforting to know I've got a lower gear I can drop down to when the hill gets hard. Keep track of your progress. Notice where you are on the hill when you ""bail out."" As you get close to that point on each ride psych yourself up to make it or even make it a bit farther. For me, it is easier to push through burning in my legs than through gasping for breath, so I tend to moderate my climbing so that I can breath easily and tough it out on my legs (but that is me, you might have a different way). The important thing is to have some standard for progress so that you can see you're gains – even before you can make the whole hill. Practice standing as you climb, you might find it easier to climb standing. For me standing helps on some hills, but I have to start before my legs are too tired and my gear can't be too low. Standing is one of my ""escape hatches"" when I discover that I'm in too high a gear on a hill. Sometimes it is just fun, but not @andy256's comment below – it is not an efficient way to climb. The energy expenditure is actually higher than when spinning. My understanding is that working really hard (too the point of exhaustion) a few times a week is necessary to stimulate muscle growth. I don't think you have to work hard for long (just a few minutes), but apparently it is essential. Two books that I've found really helpful are Just Ride and Eat Bacon, Don't Jog, both by Grant Peterson."
Why does my bike constantly break/need servicing?,"The bike you have is a decent low/mid-range hybrid bike with entry-level name-brand components. It should absolutely be mostly trouble-free with basic maintenance for a daily 4 mile commute. While replacing the cheap plastic pedals with a decent set of metal or high-quality poly pedals is standard business for any new bike, the other problems are worrying.  To be honest I don't think it was assembled correctly at the shop, and the mistakes in assembly - mis-alignment of the derailers, improper torquing of components (too loose for the bottom bracket and crank, too tight for the chaincase), etc. - are causing new issues to pop up on the regular. If you bought the bike from the shop who's been fixing it, find another shop. Heck, find another shop, period - any pro bike mechanic worth their salt should be finding and fixing these issues on their work-stand before you find them on the road.  It may be that there are so many problems on the bicycle that need remediation, a new or gently used bike might be a more economical solution than trying to bring this one into some semblance of repair. Find a different shop to buy it at and to maintain it."
Safely overtaking pedestrians,"Probably the most important thing isn't what signal, but when you signal.  Try to give the pedestrians several seconds of warning. I've notice that many cyclists don't give the pedestrians enough time.  The pedestrians you're about to pass need to hear the signal, look around trying to figure out where the signal came from, decide with their friends whether to step right or left, move to the side, decide that the other side is better and move to the other side...  And that takes a few seconds...  ringing your bell when you're 10 feet (3 meters) back and moving fast doesn't really help.  This may mean needing to slow down on paths in general, and especially needing to slow down (or at least stop pedaling) as you approach pedestrians. What I usually do is ring the bell (""ding"") when I'm a good distance back, then again twice (""dingding"") if I'm getting closer and they don't seem to have noticed.  I do this whether they're in the way or not, to warn them not to suddenly step into my way.  If they did have to move, or especially if had to go to some effort  (holding a dog back, keeping their child on the right side of the road, etc) I say ""Thank You"" and smile as I pass. Otherwise I just say ""good morning"" or something like that. I would avoid anything like ""on your left""; most people will move right when you say that, but a small percentage will just hear the ""left"" and move left instead. Also, avoid horns: they confuse people. If it's a big organized group of runners, yelling out ""bike back"" has worked well for me; that's what local runners use to tell runners further up in the pack about a cyclist, and usually results in a combination of them all yelling ""bike back"" up the line and moving to the same side of the path."
What should I look for when buying a used bicycle?,"In my area, there is a shop called Recycled Cycles, where they buy old bikes, fix them up and resell them at a discount. When my wife and I last visited, they had quite a few vintage bikes for sale.  You can also take a look at pawn shops, and if you live near a college/university, the campus police may hold a bike auction near the beginning of the school year. Our department collects abandoned bikes at the end of the spring semester and sell them the next calendar year (giving the owners time to come back and claim them). We usually have 60 or more bikes up for auction, ranging from rust buckets to almost brand new Treks. As for what to look for in a bike, take a look at the answers in Purchasing a Bike."
How do I determine the correct position for my bicycle seat?,"For a quick fit, the general goal is to keep the seat high enough that you can get a nearly-full leg extension, without 'locking' the knee. Over a long period of time, if you find that you are having knee, foot or hip pains, try making small adjustments with the saddle, about 0.5-1.0cm at a time, either up, down, forwards or backwards. If the pain gets worse, try the other direction. Give it some time, and eventually you should find a painless position. A tip I recently got from a friend having a similar problem proved interesting: Those of us who are males typically 'dress' right  or left. For him, aligning his saddle with the nose turned slightly off-center (away from the direction of 'dressing') alleviated all of his knee discomfort!"
What purpose do the rubber 'hairs' have on new tyres?,"Note the technical term for what you are calling ""hairs"" is ""vent spews.""[1] As the name indicates, they are a consequence of an important detail of the tire fabrication process. While liquid rubber is being injected or otherwise forced into the tire mold, air bubbles can form in the rubber or between the rubber and the mold. These bubbles can cause the finished tire to be weakened or malformed. To prevent that, tire manufacturers place vent holes in the mold to allow the air to escape under pressure. Necessarily, some rubber will get forced into these holes, forming the vent spews upon curing (which is the process by which the tire rubber converts from liquid to solid). These vent spews serve no useful purpose in the finished tire; conversely, they can be removed without consequence. [1] for some citations, see this ask.com post and this reddit post"
Pros/Cons of Bar-Ends?,"Bar ends are typically banned from group/club rides because of the potential to hook another rider when riding in a tight group.  Because a flat MTB-style handlebar is wider than a drop bar, adding bar ends increases the likelihood of snagging another rider.  (drop bars still can cause crashes though, which I've seen first hand) On the plus side, adding bar ends gives you more hand positions to choose from (similar to using drop bars).  This is very important on long rides (e.g. touring) since your hands can go numb and possibly suffer nerve damage if you keep them in one position for too long.  Some people find the hand position on bar ends more comfortable too. @Papuass has been injured by a bar end in a crash.  My experience is the opposite: the bar end protected my hand from sliding along the pavement at high speed, saving me a fair amount of skin.  So it can go both ways. If you're not doing group rides where bar ends are banned, I would definitely consider trying them for the sake of having more hand positions."
What clothing is best for wet weather/cycling in the rain?,"Lightweight polyester or microfiber materials do the job. Pearl Izumi is my favourite. Bike specific rain jackets are a must if you are looking for comfort. Generally they are very thin and have air vents in them. There is no reason to wear heavy rain jackets. Instead, layer up up with a base layer (often merino wool or synthetic thermals) + mid layer + the shell (which is the jacket). That is probably the most common layup for cyclists and it will keep you warm."
Can your rims wear down from too much braking?,"I have worn through quite a few rims, mostly because I live in a hilly area and I ride my bikes more than I clean them. That said, I do think that if you are to clean anything on a bike then the rims are probably what you want to be cleaning most importantly. A couple of years ago I inflated the tyres to the value on the sidewall, walked away from the garage and heard a very loud bang. The rim had split in two on one side and I was very glad I was not in the shed at that time. A year before that - on a small wheeled folding bike - I had a similar problem. Although I had been running some experimental brake blocks that were supposed to be 'extra good' the problem was the wheel size - smaller wheels wear out quicker because there is a smaller braking surface. A 5cm long section appeared buckled, as if I had hit a kerb, which I never do on a folding bike for obvious reasons. I have also had some high-end Mavic rims wear through. Those had holes in the outer sidewall but they did not fail in a catastrophic way. However, they did feel 'spongy' and that was not just spoke tension. Obviously the brakes on my 3-speed will never wear through its 50's vintage genuine-stainless-steel rims, but stopping distances are comparable to what you get with an aircraft carrier. Steel is such a no-no for rims - heavy and useless under braking. As for how to mitigate against catastrophic rim failure, you may want to consider getting wheels with 'wear indicators' in them. A lot of the better MTBs and Road Bikes have these. Alex Rims - as found on Giant MTB's have the 'wear indicator' - this appears as a black line in the side of the rim. This should stand out against the un-anodized sidewall and when it does not you could potentially have problemos. I have not tried them myself, personally I think that it is better to have a feel for one's bike - if the wheel is too springy you know that it is on its way. The problem is rarely with the front rim (unless you do all your braking on the front). During regular cleaning you can feel the concave side of the rim, and those grooves but you don't really know if they are getting a bit too paper thin. Returning to my comparative experience of the Mavic's that survived having big holes in them and the cheap rims that failed, I would be more inclined to go for rims like the Mavic where the outer sidewall is not 100% important to the structural integrity. The 'wear line' is a good idea but not really for me. I managed 6000 miles - 25 miles *5 * 50 on the folding bike before the rims went, this was a hard commute with a lot of braking due to how London is a 'sliding block puzzle'. 6000 miles is an accurate guess on how long the cheapo rims on that bike lasted, that is around the 10K mark in 'clicks'. I did trial quite a few products on that bike including some 'extra good' brake blocks. The circumference braking area was probably half that of your bike, so, by rule of thumb I reckon you have got 1/3 to 1/2 way through your rims. Nowadays I do not reach for the back brake so readily - certainly not automatically when the front one will do. For me rim wear is a real consideration. "
How do self-adjusting hydraulic disc brakes work?,"I think the answer he was looking for was how they adjust as the pads get worn.  There is a check valve in the master cylinder, that will allow enough fluid from the reservoir when the lever is pulled.  If more fluid is needed because of pad degradation, it passes it into the active system.  Therefore with more fluid in the system, the piston is pushed out slightly more and the pad is the same distance from the rotor. That is why your res. needs to be topped off occasionally.  "
Why do we rarely see recumbents and almost never see velomobiles?,"My regular (commuting) bike is an old Cannondale mountain bike with road slicks. It's great for city riding, but it murders my back, crotch, hands, feet, etc. on long trips. So, a couple years ago I bought a Bacchetta Giro 26 recumbent bike specifically for a 2000+ mile ride. I've used it since for rides of longer than a day. So here's my two cents: Comfort: Riding a 'bent consists of sitting in a lawn chair doing leg-presses all day. IMO, no diamond frame bike (DF) will ever come anywhere close to matching a 'bent for comfort. Over the last week of my trip I rode back-to-back-to-back-to-back 110+ mile days with no issues other than some soreness in my knees. Best of all, you can look at the scenery instead of the asphalt, without craning your neck. This is a massive plus. Safety: The bike I bought has 26"" wheels front and rear. My head is a few inches lower than on a DF, but I've never had any issues with visibility. I rode through several major metropolitan areas in fairly heavy traffic and never felt unsafe or invisible. Dork factor: Everyone is fascinated by the bike. Everyone. I had a Hell's Angels looking dude shout ""nice hog"" at me at one point. Lots of people ask if I built it myself. One guy pulled over to take a photo. Every single person who has remarked on the bike has been enthusiastic and friendly, with one (group) exception: spandex-clad road riders, who generally pretend they don't see me. Hills: Climbing hills on a 'bent isn't all that tough. It just requires persistence. You won't blast up a hill, but you can climb for hours on end. The biggest negative is that on a steep hill, if you stop for any reason, it can be damn near impossible to get going again. Also, balance becomes an issue at very low speeds. All that said, 'bents are ideal for touring, so-so for daily utilitarian use, and of course illegal for racing. Of those three uses, touring is the rarest, and it's pretty hard to build a market around something most people don't do.  It's a pity, IMO — 'bents are a lot of fun, but most folks will never know it. But then again, I've got mine and get a lot of use out of it. If other people miss out, that's their problem, not mine. I expect most recumbent riders feel the same way."
Triple vs Double chainring?,"The idea used to be that a triple was just a double with an extra small, 'granny' ring (i.e. only grandmothers would need to use that one) so there was definitely some snobbery in a triple; that it was designed for those who needed a little more help. So on the club training run, you might be teased for it. (Google for 'triple granny ring' for various forum discussions and banter; don't worry, most of the responses are SFW.)  Practically, what it tends to mean is not necessarily a bigger gear at the top (i.e. big front ring & small back ring) but a much lower gear at the bottom, for the hills. So with the same rear cassette you might compare a 50/34 double for a 50/39/30 triple (although a 50/34 is probably more what is called these days a 'compact'). That range of triple combined with a typical rear cassette of 12-28 would work for most hills.  You also get a lot more options; so you'll get the similar effective ratios in several ways, because the ranges on the big ring overlap more with the middle, and the middle with the little one. Also, the gears are closer together - so you're more likely to find something that works well at the right time.  It is also easier to change on the front ring of a triple, on a compact you'll often need to change down a gear or two on the back when you move on to the bigger front ring, which means the chain is being yanked both ways and strained that bit more. But on the triple, you're not as far away, so you'll often not need to change the back at the same time as shifting the front. "
What are the holes in the mudguard for?,"All was said already, those holes are for so called coat protector (those prevent your coat or trench being caught by the revolving wheel).
What was not done is placing a picture of one, and one picture saves thousand of words. 
 By the way, quite popular and easily available in The Netherlands, so if you need help, let me know."
"What are the differences (and their practical implications) between a 29"" mountain bike and a cyclocross bicycle?","There are a few very good answers on here already, however, I feel that a few pointers have been overlooked. I am not sure whether 29-ers suit all riders. Height comes into it, a 29-er imposes a high handlebar and heavier wheels than a 26"" MTB. IMHO you need to be 6"" or taller for the big wheel to make sense. The distance between you and the top tube is important on a MTB, regardless of your skill level. Most MTB's have a 'compact geometry' with big seat-post. Out the saddle it is useful to not have a 'five bar gate' between your legs, so, if you do go for the MTB, err on the smaller rather than the larger frame. You don't get this with CX bikes as a rule, although I would not be surprised if Giant do make one. Most 29-ers (if not all) come with disc brakes. CX bikes can come with discs but that is the exception rather than the rule. Disc brakes give much better stopping power, with little need for the rims to clean first. This gives you much better control. Cyclo-cross pre-dates MTB-ing by some decades and the bikes for the sport evolved from road bikes. Meanwhile, the MTB evolved from a few Californians wanting to have fun, any notion of competition came along later. They were not tied down by UCI rules and UCI rules have always served to hinder rather than advance bicycle design. CX bikes are essentially a legacy product, for a 'formula' sport, not 'pure evolution'. They were not that popular before the mountain biking boom and have not been subsequently. Meanwhile, the separately evolved MTB is the 'weapon of choice' for many, many cyclists and CX ideas such as drop bars have not lasted long on MTB's (they have been tried by Johnny Tomac and Specialized did make a 'Rock-Combo' model with them, this was short lived). Wisdom of the crowds is that the MTB rocks off-road. For a long time I thought Suspension was a solution looking for a problem. However, there is suspension and there is suspension. A full suspension top end bike by the likes of Cannondale is amazing off road, you can roll over anything without losing speed or control. Cheap suspension is no good at all, i.e. the effort you get on a £300 MTB, perhaps useful for going up a kerb but that is about it. Modern, expensive full-suspension bikes are ridiculously light for how much is going on and a delight to ride. Well worth the investment, unless you are going XC with a bit of road to get to the trail in which case a hard-tail with front lockout is better for the ride as a whole. If you are a road-bike person then you probably carry nothing. Sometimes it is useful to have a bike you can carry stuff with. An MTB is really well suited to putting a rack on the back and carrying stuff. That may be just a trip to the shops or a long distance tour. Whatever your choice - CX or MTB, do look for those magical eyelets on the rear dropout for putting a rack on there. It may not be what you want to do now, but down the line it just might well be."
Why are most bicycle gears designed to have so much overlap,"Having an overlap between the ratio ranges available with each chainring means you don't have to use your front derailleur as much. Based on your understanding and expectations of the terrain and conditions ahead, you choose a chainring which gives you access to a useful set of harder and easier ratios. The cassette ratios are spaced to achieve a vaguely consistent %-difference between adjacent gears, with the limits that you can't have fractions of a tooth and for smooth shifting the derailleur's upper pulley has a minimum and maximum distance from the teeth, so the derailleur's geometry needs to move that pulley through an arc that echoes the arc of the cassette. Having ratios closer together means when accelerating you don't have to ""spin out"" one gear to avoid getting ""bogged down"" in the next harder gear, and when climbing you don't lose momentum with a sudden loss of resistance on each change down a gear. Alternative 1: Internal hub gears e.g Rohloff 14 speed, Shimano Alfine & Nexave 11,8 or 7 speeds.
Low maintenance but heavy and make removing and fitting your rear wheel more difficult. Alternative 2: Single-chainring MTB setup with a wide-ratio cassette 10 and 11 speed systems are available with smallest sprocket 9,10 or 11 teeth and largest sprocket between 40 and 50 teeth, for an overall ratio difference from hardest to easiest ratio of 4:1 - 5:1. The derailleur needs to be designed for the steeper cassette angle, of you can use a hanger extender (e.g the GoatLink) to move it down so it clears the largest sprocket, but in the hardest gears the upper pulley may be too far from the teeth to shift nicely."
What are the differences between men's and women's bike frames?,"Way back when safety bikes were becoming popular, women wore skirts. Skirt lengths were to the ankle. The dropped top bar made getting on possible while maintaining respectability. Women were considered too fragile to risk hitting the top tube, hence the slanted bar. The trend continued even long after women stopped riding in long skirts. Modern WSD (women specific design) geometry differs from conventional bike geometry. The difference goes beyond just size. Whether it is needed depends on who you ask. While some women may be smaller than the average male, many are as tall; height is not the only issue. Many women have a different leg to torso ratio than the male average and the frames are built to fit that difference. This is not to say that a women needs a female specific frame or that a male wouldn't fit on a WSD frame. It all depends on the individual physical traits of the rider.   "
Why does pedalling backwards not move my bike backwards?,"Do you hear a ""tick"" sound every time you spin the wheel anti-clockwise? that's the freewheel mechanism composed by two small parts called ""pawls"" and when you spin it on that direction, those pawls turn loosely until they find the ""dent"" in the inner mechanism (the ratchet body), that's when the ""tick"" sound happens.  When you ride your bike, those two pawls do exactly the opposite, they catch the ""dents"" and force the inner mechanism to rotate! it's wonderfully ingenious and simple at the same time.  I've disassembled and assembled several and it amazes me every time."
What makes a good entry level road bike?,"At the beginning of the summer I just bought an old Norco bike.  I have had tons of fun on it.  I watched Kijiji (similar to craigslist) every day for a month and eventually this bike came up.  It had never been ridden (there was not even a scratch on it) and the price was only $75 Canadian.   Comparing my Norco to a friends $3000 Trek, here is what I found:    In conclusion, if you want to race you will need the better bike.  If you want to have fun, be active and go fast I think that the older road bike is an excellent entry point.  Probably I will invest in a better road bike at some point but I will defiantly still keep this bike to make grocery runs and ride to school.  (Maybe I will convert it to a single speed).  "
Which states or countries have stop-sign-as-yield laws for bicyclists (Idaho stop law)?,"Idaho passed their law in 1982 and it was brought up in the Oregon legislature but failed to win enough support to be passed.  California and Montana have considered adopting similar laws, but they have not yet been brought to their respective legislatures.  So, in the US, it sounds like Idaho is still the only state with such a law. Here is an an animation explaining the law: http://vimeo.com/4140910"
"Intersection detection doesn't notice me, what should I do?","In most states it's the law that if the signal is malfunctioning you can proceed through ""with caution"" against the signal.  Forester and others have argued that if a signal does not appropriately recognize the presence of a bike it's ""malfunctioning"" and you're on reasonably firm legal ground to invoke the ""malfunctioning signal"" provision.  (However, I've never heard of this being tested in court.) Do note that the presence of a camera does not necessarily mean that the signal is video-controlled.  It may be that the cameras are there for general traffic monitoring, and the signal is still triggered by buried loop, radar detector, etc.  Also, often there are sensors installed for detecting oncoming emergency vehicles that look a little like a camera but are not. If it is a buried loop you can usually tell by observing the cuts in the pavement where the loop was installed (though of course a buried loop may be subsequently converted to video control).  But with a buried loop the best place for the bike, to optimize detection, is more or less directly over one side of the loop, vs being in the middle of the loop.  (As a last resort, lay your bike down over one side of the loop.  I used to deal with one intersection where I could trigger the signal by just leaning the bike to about 45 degrees.)  Note that a steel bike will usually be more effective than an aluminum one, and a carbon fiber bike is unlikely to be detected at all."
Cycling uphill on a road - sitting or standing on pedals?,You're most efficient sitting with a cadence between 80 - 100 (faster if you can do it) so it's recommended that you stay seated as much as possible. For mountain biking staying seated increases the weight on your rear tire and reduces the chances of it slipping as long as you can keep a smooth spin stroke and not 'mash' the pedals on the down stroke. Standing is harder on your body but in long climbs it's great to switch it up so that you move some of the force around your muscles and give them a break. Standing is also great to get you up that 'really steep' part of a climb or to sprint over the top and lose your friends (or win a race).  As stated above stay seated with a high cadence for as long as possible. Switch up to standing as needed to give yourself a break or an extra boost of power.
What headset/radio products exist for bike-to-bike communication?,"Years ago, when my wife and I started riding together, we got a pair of cheap two-way-radios, with headsets that included VOX.  This allowed us to talk even when we weren't riding side-by-side.  And since we weren't trying to talk from a mile away, it didn't matter how cheap the radios were. Of course, this requires you coordinate with your co-worker, both have radios set up and tuned to the same frequency."
Why aren't electric bikes mainstream?,"I would add to the already existing answers some of the thoughts that come to me as a bike user. For me using a bicycle is a mean to prevent getting out of shape. Using an electrical bike would be like going hiking with a car or elevator. This applies for a lot of my friends riding bikes.  Some of my colleagues complimented me on the fact that I exercise daily by riding to work. In the same register, I expect the opposite reaction for riding an electrical bike, as it would point the user out as a lazy/weak person, unwilling/unable to do any effort. Not saying it's true or right to be judged, but people often live by what others think about them (the coolness factor). you may get coolness points in the gadget section, but it's a different group of people that will compliment you on that. So it depends on where you want to position yourself. A cheap bicycle is something you can easily toss in some corner when reaching a destination (edit: and of course diligently chain it up), without too much worry regarding theft. Can't do the same (with peace of mind) with an electrical bike. Depending on where you live, using a cheap (second-hand, maybe) bicycle for two to three months already pays for the bike itself, by saving on transport costs. With an electrical bike, there is a steep initial investment, and the ROI is spread over a much longer term. Electrical bikes are heavy and not so easy to maneuver in tight spaces where you need to carry them (like stairs). If they are light usually they are very expensive. Finally there is the same concern as for electrical cars: will the charge last for the whole trip? If not, you'll have to pedal-drive a lot of additional mass accounting for the motor and battery."
What is best for your brakes when stopping at the bottom of the hill?,"One should not trade their safety for prolonging brake pads life. Thus gaining the speed and hoping to lose it at the very end of the ride is not the wisest thing to do. Having said that the question is rather whether to: I'd opt for the latter since it allows the rims or discs to cool down thus having them ready and at considerable efficiency should you suddenly need them. Furthermore, you can analyse the evolution of the roller brakes - the latter the generation the larger the radiator for the drum - it was observed that on longer descends when the brakes were partly engaged, they did overheat and lose their braking capability. With larger radiators they did overheat, much later (if ever) though."
Polite way to ride in the dark,"Consider how you feel when a fellow cyclist approaches you will full beam straight ahead. It's pretty blinding, even for a moment, and especially off-road when your eyes aren't used to it. So in a park: If you do this then it doesn't matter whether you illuminate pedestrians or for how long."
Can I use a cyclocross bike for regular road-biking purposes?,"You can absolutely ride road on a CX bike. Many of the components are actually road components, including the wheels, so slap a pair of 700x23's on the stock wheelset and off you go.
Things to consider: Cross bikes are going to be a little heavier than a road bike in the same price range—probably a couple to a few pounds. Ultimately not that big of a deal if you're not riding road competitively. Some may argue, but it's ok to be wrong… cantilever brakes are inferior to road calipers, at least on the road. I won't get into why CX bikes use canti's as there are plenty of explanations across the interwebs, but you won't get the same control out of a pair of canti's (or v's/mini-v's) that you'll get from road brakes. There's a reason that they're different. The best substitute (and they're getting much easier to get your hands on now since discs recently became UCI legal for CX) is frame/fork combos built to accept disc brake calipers. Again, they're slightly heavier than canti's or v's, but the overall feel is worth it, both on and off the road (and especially in the mud!) This is probably the biggest one in my opinion:
Though they are similar, ultimately the feel between a road bike and a CX bike is noticeably different. Among more subtle differences, CX bikes have longer wheelbases, higher bottom brackets, longer chainstays, and slacker headtube angles than road bikes do. These are all good things when riding off the road and in the mud because they lend to the bike's stability. On the road however, these geometry differences translate into a slower steering, more sluggish feeling bike. Once again, there's a reason that they're different. That said, my CX bike probably sees the same amount of mileage as my road bike does. I ride it on the road regularly even for longer rides and it is a great commuter. If you need one bike to do it all and you don't plan on hitting seriously gnarly MTB trails (they can handle light to moderate singletrack duty), a CX bike is the most versatile machine you can own. To answer the next part of your question, 99.99% of the time you are going to come out on top financially by purchasing a complete bike as opposed to piecing it together by buying parts separately. Building a bike from scratch is fun and you get exactly the build out that you want, but in my experience with many bikes it has never once been cheaper. Finally, to find the right bike, go to several of the reputable bike shops around you and try out what they have. Due to geometry differences you may like one bike better than the next or one may fit you better than the rest. Test rides are key. There are a ton of great bike brands out there and a lot of your choice may come down to personal preference. Find a shop with a good fitter. Bike fit is important for all styles of bikes, but it's crucial if you're going to be spending a bunch of time on the road. Some shops will throw a professional fitting in with the purchase of a new bike. Be sure to ask. Good luck!"
Front suspension or full suspension mountain bike,"If we assume that both models are at about the same price point, here is what you can expect: Your style of riding may dictate that an full-suspension is appropriate, so the best thing to do would be to describe how you want to ride to the professionals at your local bike shop and listen to their advice. I have an admitted bias toward hardtails (and even fully rigid bikes). I've been riding a long time (since before mountain bikes existed...), and don't really ride anything seriously aggressive off-road (but I have ridden a lot of Utah Red Rock Desert).  I've tried several full-suspension bikes, but for my type and style of riding I've not been convinced that the added cost to get to a similar weight/component mix was worth it."
Is it difficult for one person to ride a tandem bike?,"I have a 1990 steel racing tandem, and sadly it gets more miles solo than with a stoker. The main differences between tandems and solo bikes apply when riding a tandem on your own (rear wheel cuts corners more, you can't bunny hop)  but points to note: Speed is generally not an issue - I've topped 40 km/h solo on my tandem, and the previous owner exceeded 70 km/h on it on a race, with two riders. "
What are the pros and cons of panniers vs messenger bags?,"Messenger bags still get your back sweaty, sometimes even moreso than a backpack since messenger bags are often wider than a backpack. I find a messenger bag more convenient than a backpack for shorter trips, but a pannier better for rides of greater than a mile or two. A messenger bag is quite handy if you have to make a lot of stops and don't have a lot to carry.  I often get back pain if I carry my messenger bag for any length of time.  When carrying a messenger bag with netbook and a book or two, I'm hesitant to rise up out of the saddle. Panniers can actually make a bike a bit more stable, if the weight is carried low to the ground. (The only time I can stand out of the pedals while climbing is on a loaded touring bike, but that's an extreme situation.)  My MO is to use what's appropriate to the trip. If I'm riding downtown to get some work done in a cafe with a laptop, I'll most likely take the messenger bag, but if I need to carry stiff for a longer ride, I'll use a couple of panniers.  I've sometimes used one pannier, if the load isn't too heavy. You can also distribute a light load between two panniers. (That's a good use of front panniers, which, depending on the bike, can be more stable that rear panniers.)  There are options for panniers that need to be carried around a lot. This question and its answers address that well: Recommendation for panniers used off the bike a lot In conclusion, the choice of pannier-vs-messenger bag/backpack is a false choice. Both are tools, and you can use what's appropriate to the job at hand. "
Why should I wear bicycle clothes made of spandex?,"I thought spandex shorts looked weird too, until my wife bought me a pair with the padding. Now, I can't ride in regular shorts at all! The shorts with padding help protect your sensitive groin parts, as well help keep you cooler and drier (preventing nasty sores) by wicking the moisture (sweat) away from your body. There's no binding or rubbing in the wrong areas, and all your jiggly parts are held securely in place.  And a big, important point about bike shorts - you wear them without underwear.  Jerseys also come in tight and loose fitting material - I personally prefer the loose-fitting jerseys (I'm not exactly skinny enough to wear the tight jerseys). Other than the moisture-wicking they provide, they also come in extremely visible colors, which is nice when you're out riding by yourself, especially if visibility is low."
Can Cycle Camera Evidence be Used by Police to Enforce Dangerous Motorists?,"I've heard lots of cyclists complain they submitted their helmet camera video of motorist encounters to the Police who ""did nothing"". To avoid wasting cyclist's time- and the Police's, I've documented the process I followed to have an aggressive motorist enforced who almost killed me. BTW, I'm myself a former Police Officer, so I understand the rigamarole of the Court process. This is a master class on bringing dangerous motorists who threaten the lives of cyclists to the Police's attention. Is the camera's time correct? Incorrect time on the video won't in itself get your video rejected by the Police, but it could be used by the driver to aver they weren't the motorist if you can't nail-down the time of the incident with precision. In such a situation they'd still be obliged to name the motorist or face 6 points on their license and a £1,000 fine here in the UK, but best to avoid any ambiguity. As you're recording video that's being used as evidence in a prosecution, always ensure your cycle camera's time is correct. It's also not a bad idea to just video your watch before you set off on a cycle to validate the camera's clock is correct. Can you see the motorist's plate clearly? If not, you're wasting your time; Police won't bother considering your evidence.  If you can, it might be considered by the Police. Is the incident recent? Don't wait too long to report as the Police are required to send the letter notifying of their intent to prosecute within (I believe) two weeks. However, I think they need to get the letter out by the 10th day after the offense. Even if your video shows the motorist breaking every law in the Highway code, if the complaint is submitted out-of-time, the Police won't consider it. Next, determine the SEVERITY of the incident. The video should evidence that it was sufficiently outrageous and not a small technical driving error that merely peeved you. The Police are busy and need to be selective about the cases they pursue, so the incident should be of a certain seriousness. For an example of what is considered ""outrageous"", here's the (edited) version of the video that I submitted to the Police. It should be clear this was pretty bad. Was the incident INTENTIONAL? Generally, intent matters in respect to violations of the law. If the incident could be explained away by the motorist as an inadvertent error they made, will be more challenging for the Police to enforce them. Indeed, if a collision almost resulted because a cyclist failed to signal their directional intent, I can understand the Police's reluctance to enforce the motorist. And I'm both a former Police Officer as well as an avid cyclist. Can you articulate a specific law you believe was broken by the motorist? Being ""offended"" by obnoxious driving is certainly frustrating, but not an offense. Review these (UK-specific) DRIVING OFFENSES against what your video depicts. If you feel confident that it does- and you're willing to testify in Court if the motorist declines to admit guilt- then you're NEARLY ready to submit the video. Did you commit any offenses under the law while cycling? The Police are going to scrutinize the actions of both the cyclist as well as the motorist they're seeking to have enforced. The Police will not allow you to give them a convenient clip neatly trimmed to only show the offense committed by the motorist. When I submitted my helmet cam video, the Police wanted me to produce a clip with one minute BEFORE and one minute AFTER the incident to determine if my own actions where to any degree contributory to the dangerous situation. So if you're cycling through red lights, not yielding to pedestrians in crosswalks and generally ignoring the Highway code, the Police might still enforce the driver- but so too they will likely enforce you for offenses in the video. Be prepared to have your own actions closely scrutinized by the Police when submitting your video. It appears that Staffordshire require video from 2 or 3 cameras before they will consider your evidence. Yes, I kid you not.  Apparently Staffordshire is open-season on cyclists and can expect no help from the ""Police"": https://road.cc/content/news/nmotd-781-no-prosecution-cyclist-only-used-one-camera-293511 It appears that Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire & Hertfordshire have pooled their resources for processing digital evidence of traffic incidents reported by the public. The link that I used to submit my complaint & evidence to Herts Police was: https://www.herts.police.uk/ro/report/rti/rti-beta-2.1/report-a-road-traffic-incident/ Initially the Police will ask you for the incident details and then an investigator will contact you by email with a link for you to submit your videos & stills (if any). PLEASE NOTE: The Police will not give you a copy of ANY of the information you submit to them. Probably worth copying the complaint details into a text file to ensure you don't have to rewrite the whole thing from scratch if the browser crashes. If they are satisfied that the motorists driving was so bad it requires Police sanction, they'll tell you, albeit due to Data Protection they'll give only broad details. The email I received from the Police was: Dear Sir / Madam Thank you for the submission of your footage, we have now reviewed the

relation to the incident you have reported. These options include the following: *Warning letter
*Course offer
*Points and fine
*Court Due to the Data Protection Act 2018 we are unable to provide you with
the exact outcome or action that your submission has generated.
Further information about the Data Protection Act can be found at
https://www.gov.uk/data-protection Yours Sincerely Digital Evidence Team Although the Police's response is very generic due to GPDR laws, a retired London Metropolitan Police Officer that I cycle with who viewed the video said the the motorist could expect at the least to receive 3 points on their license and £100 clue. He also said somebody who drives like that probably already has points on their license. And if that's true, the motorist could potentially be at-risk of losing their license. In any event, any points for a moving violation- especially if the charge is ""driving without due care and attention"" as is likely here- on one's license translates into increased car insurance premiums for 5 years. So the financial sanction could be very material. And it's still possible that you could learn what action the Police took if the motorist denies their guilt and your appearance at Court is then required. Which of course I'd be most happy to give evidence if asked. It's certainly VERY possible to have violations of laws made to protect cyclists enforced using your helmet camera video.  Indeed, unless cyclists DO report outrageously dangerous motorists to the Police, these murderists, erm ""motorists"" will feel they have impunity to continue to take risks with our lives. I've got a more detailed page on this which explains how to use Handbrake to process your helmet camera video evidence at: http://www.penny-farthing.org/enforcing-dangerous-drivers/"
Do glueless tube patches work as well as glue ones?,"They work ok - if you are just riding around town, they would probably be fine. If you are on a ride out in the middle of nowhere, I wouldn't count on these. The ones with glue work significantly better, to the point where I wouldn't buy the glue-less ones."
"Broken glass on the bicycle path, what to do?","There are three approaches you can use in combination. Preparation Tough tires - people have their favorite puncture-proof tires. Kevlar reinforced tires work pretty well. Hard tires - pump your tires to close to the maximum pressure written on the side wall. This definitely reduces punctures, and can be combined with puncture-proof tires. At the time You limit your question ""reducing punctures while [riding] though glass"". Obviously, if you could avoid the trash you would. You cannot always go around the trash. If you are able, you could bunny hop over it. This is also not always possible when commuting, due to lack of time, heavy traffic (including other bikes) limiting your options, or carrying a pack or panniers. Slowing down is often also not an option when commuting because of following traffic.  After the fact Brush your tires. It should be acknowledged that there are some who are squeamish about this. But it is very effective at removing foreign objects from your tires. In 35 years since I learned to do it, I've never (seriously) hurt my hand. Of course you should wear gloves. Most gloves have a reinforced patch across the palm to the base of the thumb for this purpose. (Many people mistake this for extra padding :-) Don't wait: as soon as you hit the trash start brushing your tires. The more revolutions your tires do, the more the trash gets hammered into them. So brush them strait away. It doesn't help to stop to do it; firstly, it interrupts your ride, but mainly because by the time you stop the damage is done. For the front tire, place your palm (near the base of your thumb) gently on the top of the rotating tire, in front of the brakes. The tire surface must be moving away from anything you could catch your hand in. You only need to keep it there for a few seconds, enough for one or maybe two revolutions of the wheel. Sometimes you feel a slight bump when you have successfully removed something from the tire. Usually, you'll feel nothing. The back tire is a bit harder to brush, because you have to reach down to an awkward place and if you have to look it means you're not looking where you're going. So you'll want to practice this skill before you use it in traffic. Again, brush your tire in front of the brakes, in front of the back stay, where the tire is moving away from the brakes. Because of the low clearance between the back tire and the down tube on most race bikes, you need to be careful not to let you hand get pulled down into the gap. That hurts. Also avoid poking your finger into the spokes. That hurts too. After reading this you can see why some people avoid doing it. Just be careful while you are learning, and practice before doing it in traffic. It's a valuable skill to have."
Why can't Yellow Jersey change hands on last day of Tour De France?,"Tradition, and the layout of the final stage.  Tradition holds that the last stage is a victory parade for the GC contender, and the yellow jersey. Cadel Evans rode a good part of the 2011 final stage, once in Paris, with champagne in hand. In addition, the layout of the stage, a 95 km flat ride finishing with multiple laps around the Champs Elysees, and culminating in a bunch sprint, rarely allows the opportunity for any major time to be gained. So unless they are within seconds, as in the 1989 Greg Lemond win by 8 seconds over Laurent Fignon, the last stage will rarely play a part in the GC standings.   As is stated in the description of the stage on the letour.fr page today: Every other time, it has been a road stage that has been decided in a bunch sprint, except on four occasions. Those exceptions were the victories taken by Alain Meslet in 1977, Bernard Hinault in 1979, Eddy Seigneur in 1994 and Alexandre Vinokourov in 2005. It is incredibly hard to get a telling gap on this stage when breakaway riders are always within sight of the peloton.” If you know that a breakaway will not gain you minutes, why risk the ire of the other riders, and your public by messing with the traditions of the race? One of the things that has always brought an audience back to this race above all others are the traditions of fair play and honorable conduct that are embodied by traditions like the one that allows a crashed race leader to regain his time by the other riders, before the race continues. These unwritten traditions are not rules, but they make this race special. Combine the two, and you will rarely see a major change on the last day. It can, and does happen. Just not often."
Runny nose while biking,"Well, this probably sounds gross and I'm kind of reluctant to say it, but I'm able to blow the snot out of my nose without hitting myself or my bike.  I try to only do it when there's no one around, but occasionally that isn't possible.  Basically, I turn my head so my nostrils are towards the ground and exhale forcibly through my nose.  I'm not sure it will work for everyone--perhaps I have remarkably straight nasal passages?"
What is the best breakfast right before cycling?,"Entirely depends on the lenght of ride. If you're riding for less than 2 hours then your body already has everything on board that it needs. If you're working for more than 2 hours you should eat complex carbs (pasta, oatmeal) 2 hours before the ride so that they have time to digest before you actually need them. Also eating too much just before can limit your performance as your body also has to work to digest a load of food in your stomach. Adding links to answer the comment below. I eat a small bowl of Cheerios with some fruit thrown in for flavour. I ride most morning at about 5:30am. If I'm working hard (either 2 plus hours or 2 hours really hard workout) I'll carry some Gatorade diluted 50/50 (I find it's easier on my stomach). When I ride 100k+ or century length I make sure I get up and eat 3 hours before the ride. Then drink 50/50 Gatorade till the ride. During the ride I drink both 50/50 mix and water. I also start refueling with food after about 30 minutes. Small bites of energy bars, bananas, whatever your stomach can handle. What type of conditions do you ride in? Is it really hot? Are you drinking enough fluids? If you lose more than 2 pounds on a ride you're not drinking enough. What is your exertion level? Are you going too hard for too long for your fitness level? Someone below also mentioned protein. Many of the 'higher end' sports drinks also come in a protein variety. The reading I've done at the very least suggests that you eat protein and carbs within 30 -45 minutes after a ride to maximize the recovery/refueling of your muscles."
What makes the bicycles in Amsterdam suitable for riding with jeans on?,"In places where there are lots of bikes, most people who are riding them are making short journeys purely for transport. For a short ride of a few kilometers, it really doesn't matter what you're wearing. Any clothes that are comfortable to wear in general will be comfortable to wear on a bike for fifteen minutes. People who are riding longer distances, pushing harder and aiming for fitness rather than just getting from A to B will start to consider clothing that's more oriented towards exercising and people who are going even farther and pushing even harder will start to wear cycling-specific clothing. I see this exact thing when I cycle at home in Oxford. If I cycle directly into town, most of the people I see on bikes are just wearing whatever clothes will be appropriate at their destination. If I take a more circuitous route around the outskirts of town before heading into the centre through an area where not many people live, I see a lot of people wearing ""general exercise"" clothing. If I head away from town, out into the countryside, most of the cyclists I see are wearing clothing designed specifically for cycling."
Invested too much in my car! How can it be worth cycling to work?,"If people actually find coming by car slightly more comfortable/enjoyable, then the money they spent actually is an investment. Therefore the sunk cost argument is not neccesarily a fallacy. Furthermore, even if it were, you will not likely get people on your side by proclaiming that they follow a fallacy. Hence, it I would approach the situation as follows: Ask them what is more important, the experience or the financial side of this story. You may need to practise your wording to ask this in a proper way. Explain that there are 2 scenario's for tomorrow, driving by car or coming by bike. Coming by bike is cheaper, so point out that financially it is better to come by bike tomorrow! (If they were to quote opportunity costs, like less overtime, then coming by car may be the right thing for them.) Ask them which experience they enjoy more, if they actually enjoy going by car more, then driving by car may be the best thing for them. If they enjoy going by bike, then point out they should just do it! It is more enjoyable and it saves money!"
What are the conditions for removing training wheels?,"Consensus seems to be more and more this: Do not use training wheels. The most important part of cycling is not the pedaling, but balancing and steering. Steering is mostly done by leaning (therefore balance) and not by turning the handle bar.
Training wheels do not help in learning to balance the bike and actively prevent leaning. Therefore it might be better to start with a balance bike (no training wheels, no pedals) to learn the essentials and add the easy part of pedaling afterwards."
"For a long (25mile each way) commute, what kind of bike should I look at?",A cyclocross bike which can accomodate fenders and a rack could be an option. I personally use an aluminum framed Cannondale CAADX Tiagra on my 17 mile (one way) commute and I like its versatility. It is relatively light (21 lbs) and has eyelets to accommodate fenders and a rack. It can also be fitted with a variety of tires ranging from slicks to studded. The XC frame makes the bike more maneuverable (can be useful in negotiating traffic) than a touring bicycle. Pic of the commuter below:  I use this bike 2 or 3 times a week to commute downtown. It is almost as fast as my road bike on uneven roads. The wider tires (that can run at lower pressure) can soak up bumps better.
Braking one-handed to signal down steep traffic-heavy slope,"As an confident road rider I'd do two major things. If I'm needing to brake hard, I'll use both hands, and leave signalling/indicating out of it completely.  You've already shown your intent by taking the lane and moving closer to the center-line. Since your experience is lesser, feel free to not do any of that.  You have to be comfortable with your intent and actions.  So instead you could: Also, if other cyclists traverse this intersection then watch and observe their methods.  If it makes sense then emulate them, and if not, then don't."
How to indicate you are going straight?,"It's difficult to say without seeing photos of the road layout.  However, if the road itself continues round to the left, you should indicate right when you're leaving it. In general, you should think about the topology of the road, rather than its geometry.  It doesn't matter that you're following a geometrically straight line; you're still leaving the road for a separate carriageway, and you need to signal this intention. The default assumption for someone crossing the road is that you'll continue along the carriageway you're already on. This said, of course, common sense should always prevail!  Never do anything that feels dangerous (for you or for someone else)."
Why is carbon fiber inherently weak? Or is it?,"Carbon fiber isn't necessarily a ""weak"" or ""fragile"" material. If you had a tube of the same diameter and thickness of typical CF as a typical steel frame tube, that CF tube would be extremely strong and durable. Metals like steel and aluminum are isotropic materials. That means their mechanical properties are identical in all directions. If you have a cube of steel, it will respond the same way regardless which direction you pull or push on it. Carbon fiber is a composite material. It consist of tons of little bundles of the fibers held together with an epoxy.  A block of steel is, well, like steel, but carbon fiber is like a big bundle of straws glued together. In one direction, it is extremely strong, but if you push or pull to the side, it will collapse. In that one dimension where it is strong, it is vastly stronger than steel. However, in other directions it's rather flimsy. So, engineers have been able to exploit those properties in bicycle frames. In a bicycle frame, the vast, vast majority of the forces are primarly along a single dimension. They can make tubes thinner and lighter yet still retain the desired strength and stiffness.  So, there is no mechanical reason that you couldn't build a fully loaded touring bike or something like a Salsa Fargo with a carbon frame, and it could be just as tough and durable. And it would probably be lighter than a steel or aluminum frame. But the reason it isn't done is because of the market. Carbon fiber is an expensive material and difficult to work with, and its mechanical properties are best suited for when you demand very light applications.  When you build a steel framed bike, when you get the tubes sufficiently strong enough along their length, that because of steels isotropic properties, you get the lateral strength for free, the strength to resist things banging into it, withstanding crashes, etc. In a carbon fiber frame, you don't get the strength in the other dimensions unless you choose to design it in. In carbon fiber bikes, where weight is a serious concern, the engineering decision has been made to not make the frames strong in those areas. They could do so, but they choose not to because its not necessary for the bikes intended purpose. When you build a heavy loaded bike, you lose a lot of the carbon fibers advantages, and so it would be far more economical to use steel or aluminum.  Especially when throwing a couple filled water bottles in your pannier nearly exceeds the weight savings."
"What is the difference between I.S., post, and flat mount disc brake mounting standards?","IS mounts (also frequently called IS tabs, disc tabs, etc) are unthreaded eyelets 51mm apart that bolts run through parallel with the hub axle. In almost all cases the brake caliper is then bolted to an adapter that has one set of threads for the IS mounts and another 74mm apart for the caliper. (There are a few caliper models that omit the adapter. Shimano, Hope, and Magura have all made brakes like this.) IS has one clear upside: all the threads are in a relatively cheap and easy to replace adapter. The disadvantages are that it's more mechanically complex and expensive since there's always an adapter, and the design of the standard is such that the same adapter doesn't adapt the same caliper to the same rotor size front and rear. A adapter for 180mm in the front is an adapter for 160 used in the rear, for example. With IS, outside of a weird custom fork, 160mm is the smallest size you can use in front, but all bikes with rear IS mounts can take a 140mm adapter. Post mount places two threaded M6x1 holes 74mm apart on the frame or fork in the orientation that a caliper can be bolted to directly without any adapter, or with a post-mount adapter in between along with its supplied long bolts if a larger rotor is going to be used. The most common setup is for the minimum rotor size (the size you'd get the caliper positioned for if no adapter was used) to be 160 front/160 rear on most mountain bikes and 160 front/140 rear on most road and cross bikes, but all sorts of exceptions exist, i.e. downhill forks with 200mm minimum rotor sizes. Although it's seldom denoted this way by frame manufacturers, post mount is really a group of standards that you could call ""140mm post mount"", ""160mm post mount"", etc. Post mount is mechanically simpler, cheaper, and arguably more elegant. It has the disadvantage of putting the threads in the frame/fork, which introduces some risk of difficult or impossible to repair damage resulting from carelessness or low-quality parts. It's acceptable to helicoil a stripped post mount in most circumstances, so the actual risk of ruining a bike forever with one overzealous tightening is small. I've done this repair a number of times, particularly on certain low-end suspension forks where the thread quality was poor to begin with. Post mount does not have IS's issue where the geometry is different front and rear. A +20mm post mount adapter does the same thing on both. Facing a rear post mount on the chainstay, where they often are now on road/cross bikes, usually requires an offset facing tool to reach in and do it without bonking into the seatstay. If all manufacturers and dealers were well equipped and did their jobs right, this wouldn't make a difference for consumers. As it is I feel like there's a relatively high proportion of bikes like this sent out into the world still in need of rear post facing, but I don't have any proof. Post mount has increasingly become the norm, probably because it's simpler, cheaper, and inherently more structurally efficient. IS and post mount adapters are mostly dimensionally interchangeable between brands. It's wise when mixing brands though to take a close look that the pad contact looks how it should; weirdness does occur in this regard sometimes even though on paper it shouldn't be able to. Flat mount was designed for road bikes and has become the standard there due to its weight-saving and aero construction values. It has now spread to XC mountain bikes. It was designed by Shimano and has now been adopted by everyone else. As the name indicates, flat mount puts the caliper closer to perfectly flush with the frame or fork. Whereas IS and post mount take the same brake calipers for the most part (the exception being adapterless IS-specific brakes), flat mount is a new caliper standard altogether. Adapters to put post-mount calipers on flat mount frames and forks exist, but in individual cases it's possible for hose/housing routing or frame clearance issues to make it ugly or unfeasible. Adapters to put flat-mount calipers on post or IS mount and forks frames exist, but face spatial constraints that may make using them impossible or impractical in a given application. Flat mount calipers have the mounting threads in the caliper itself. Flat mount only is compatible with 140mm and 160mm rotors for either front or rear. (It's likely that somebody will break this rule someday, as in the front particularly there's nothing physically preventing it.) There are two completely types of flat mount adapters, for front and rear. A front fork adapter (called a 'mount plate' in Shimano parlance) is always used. It's switchable for 140 and 160 by flipping it around. The adapter is first installed onto the caliper in the desired orientation using flush-mount bolts. The fork has threaded mounting holes that the adapter then bolts to through the holes at either end of the adapter.  In back, flat-mount compatible frames use bolts going through a frame member, typically the chainstay, to thread directly into the caliper if a 140mm rotor is used, or an adapter for 160mm.  Flat mount in an of itself is a design that did a  good job of minimizing the number of adapters that may be needed, with the flippable front adapter that's always used and a choice of either no adapter or a +20mm adapter in back, for a very minimalist total of only two parts, but there are also 4 different flat mount to post mount adapter caliper permutations (140 and 160 for both front and rear). Rear flat mount installations require the bolts to be exactly the length needed to protrude through the frame member, which vary in size, with a certain amount of length left over to engage the caliper or adapter threads. Some manufacturer feature a special tip on the end of their flat mount caliper bolts that fits a safety retention clip, creating a situation where bolts can't simply be trimmed to length if the caliper is to be installed as intended by the manufacturer. At the moment flat mount adapters are interchangeable and universal between brands as far as I know. Hopefully it remains that way, but there's nothing stopping someone from releasing a brake caliper that's an exception."
Why Did Old Soviet City Bikes Have Longer Frames in General,"A soviet bicycle is designed to carry very heavy loads on the rear  (like two large containers of milk one each side). Hence the rear wheel and the pannier are moved backwards, giving more weight of the rider to the front wheel. One of the usual uses were riding them for milking cows in the pasture. A cow produces somewhat 25 liters per day and it may be more than one. It is also useful to have more clearance from the driver for fixing load on the top. Here is not a soviet bicycle but the picture explains how a bicycle is used in the village (image credit):  You clearly see the need for both clearance and load tolerance."
How do I efficiently shift gears on a road bike with downtube shifters?,"Downtube shifters will really get you in touch with your bike--more than with many other shifting systems, I believe that I can actually FEEL the rear derailleur moving in my hand when I use them.   Needless to say, I ride a lot of old road bikes.   You will quickly gain the control to shift either from various hand positions on your road bars.  Assuming the bike fits you, you should ultimately be able to use the shifters from nearly any position.  You will, of course, use the right hand to shift the rear derailleur and the left hand to shift the front.   I will talk mostly about shifting the rear derailleur, as it will require the most control and finesse.   Note also that these shifters each have two main parts that are pertinent here, the LEVER and the BARREL.  The lever is pretty obvious--it's the usually-flattened handle that sticks out.  The barrel is the round bit which is attached to the frame.  The cable wraps around this round bit--as you turn the shifter, more or less cable is wrapped which is how the shifter moves the cable and thus the derailleur.   Ordinarily, when I reach down and the bike is in high gear--with the shift lever all the way forward and parallel with the downtube--I will grasp the lever by wrapping the thumb of my right hand over the end of the shift lever.  I press the side of my pointer finger against it and slowly pull back.  This motion has less control over precise gearing and is best suited for quickly downshifting before climbing.   If I am already in low gear and the shifter is out away from the downtube, I usually actually grasp the entire lever with my right hand.  In this mode, the tip of my thumb is on the barrel and my fingers are all wrapped around the shift lever.  Motion in either direction from this position can be very precise.  As I said, you can feel the derailleur move if you're cables are new and well-greased.   It's a good setup for shifters, in my opinion.  I can't say that I prefer downtube to integrated, but as far as simplicity is concerned... nothing beats it.   Except, perhaps, Sheldon Brown reaching down and putting his forefinger on the chain to move from upper to lower chainrings. If you get a chance at the library, check out Understanding, Maintaining, and Riding the Ten-Speed Bicycle by Denise De la Rosa and Michael Kolin (Rodale Press, 1979).  This book describes shifting and using downtube shifters rather well, right down to the groovy 70's costume.  De la Rosa describes another method of hanging the thumb (I think) off of the top tube while reaching with the same hand's fingers down to the shift lever.  This only would work on a frame smaller than mine, but it's another piece of cycling history.   I hope this helps.  It certainly took my mind off my work for a few minutes!"
What is a good camera arrangement for city riding?,I've had good success with the Go Pro cameras for whitewater kayaking. We generally mount them on our helmets. They stand up to quite a beating and you can get more on a card than the camera you ask about above. If you can mount it on your helmet then it will be pointing where you look and I think you'll have better success getting shots of any collision since you're often looking at it as it happens. Here's a blog of someone doing the same thing on his daily commute. http://cranks-on-cam.com/ Looks like he's using a Drift Inovation (http://www.driftinnovation.com/x170-action-camera.php) and there is a video of his mount on the gear page.
Why do the front and rear brakes work independently?,"I see several reasons: Personally, I tend to use the rear brake for controlling my speed (slowing down just a little) and either the front brake or both brakes for stopping (especially a fast stop). An awareness at any given time of which tire is more likely to slip and using the other brake is good, though. Worth noting: it's a specialty item, but you can get a brake lever that controls both brake levers at once.  This is mostly popular with bike polo players (who use one hand for a mallet) and people with physical conditions that limit their ability to use the brake with one hand. If you don't have any special reasons to need just one lever, you're probably best off with separate levers. http://www.paulcomp.com/duplexlever.html"
Simplest and best way to keep water bottles clean and hygienic?,"A teaspoon of baking soda and warm water, is your best bet.  No nasty after taste at all. Cheap and very effective."
Arguments for/against bike lanes?,"AGAINST One of my primary issues with bike lanes is that motorists tend to think that you have to stay in that lane.  So when you have to move right because of debris, garbage cans or parked cars in the lane it further annoys ill-informed drivers. Additionally, drivers come to expect you to be out of traffic, riding on the shoulder, and will squeeze by you closer. Many bike lanes are placed immediately to the left (traffic-side, may be right depending on the country) of the parking area, so if you remain in the bike lane you are in the ""door zone"". Bike lanes tend to increase confusion and conflict at intersections, either forcing the cars to cross the lanes in an awkward manner, or enticing cyclists to filter to the front of the lane and possibly blocking turning actions by motorists. Bike lanes encourage passing on the right, which can be a very dangerous action for the cyclist. Finally - by law in most places every lane is a bike lane... there is no possible way for designated bike lanes and routes to be marked to every destination I would like to visit, and by law when I am in the lane I am traffic, I'm not blocking traffic. (sorry, I get a little militant about bike lanes, especially when they are the primary focus of improved cycling infrastructure rather than wider roads with calmer traffic.) FOR As someone with some experience teaching workshops for new bike commuters, I find that the existence of convenient bike lanes and multi-use paths makes taking those first trips easier.  Novice commuters feel more comfortable riding on a marked bike lane, even if they don't realize that they may be marginally less safe in a bike lane at the far right edge of the roadway, generally a riskier position. There are some places, like one particularly popular area in Salt Lake City, where rather than position a lane demarcated with white lines to the side of the travel lane, the DOT painted a wide green lane with bike icons almost in the middle of the right-most travel lane and erected signs that read ""Bicycles Allowed Full Use of Lane.""   This is not a bike lane, but a hybrid or shared-lane, and  I love it because it reinforces the fact that bikes are traffic, and roads must be shared. "
Is rubber cement in stationery stores the same as in tire patch kits?,"The ""cement"" used in tire tube patch kits (de)vulcanizes the rubber in the patch and of the tube. Which is a chemical process, usually using sulfur, where the rubbers bond and form a stronger bond than just an adhesive would do. Rubber cement is just a gooey adhesive. Usually latex with acetone and other chemicals to make it more pliant. You wouldn't want to use it to patch a tube since it is not very strong, will degrade the integrity of the surrounding rubber and patch, and in general make a mess."
"What is the hand gesture for ""I'm sorry""?","I use a sort of wave, raising my hand but with no movement in it (so not a 'Hey buddy' or 'I need help' side to side movement).... it works on my bicycle, on my motorcycle, and while driving a vehicle. It's got somewhat of a dual purpose: acknowledgement that I did something wrong, and/or 'thanks for letting me in' gratitude gesture. The motorcycle I find a very odd case of this. It's 95% not me giving the gesture, but receiving it after being cut off, not seen, turned in front of, etc. People are in general not interested in showing any rage and are quick to apologize when I'm on one, even if I'm not wearing the armored jacket and helmet. I don't get even half this respect in vehicles or bicycles. That was a side note that I've found interesting, but the point is that it's the same gesture I seem to get from many other people. There's no side/side or waving motion, just a hand up, fingers together, ""Thanks/Sorry""."
How can I teach my capable 20-something friend to ride a bike?,"I would go with the undersized bike method as Sheldon Brown recommends. Basically, get a bike that's a bit on the small side (and has at least one brake lever) and remove the pedals (and maybe also the cranks), so that he can have his butt on the saddle (seat) and both feet firmly on the ground with knees slightly bent.  That way he can run with the bike under him.  You might be able to get a bike with a compact frame design (sloping top tube) and set the seat really low instead of having to actually start with an undersized bike. Starting out on a grassy surface would be a good idea, but a stretch of clear unoccupied pavement/asphalt (such as a parking lot) would work quite well, too. At first he'll just use his legs and slowly get a feel for how the bike moves and balances, but as he goes faster he should be able to pull his feet up from the ground for a longer and longer time.  When he's comfortable with how a bike balances (able to coast and steer without keeping feet on the ground), put the pedals back on the bike. Might a good idea to have him wearing a helmet and gloves, and maybe also kneepads, but only if they don't make him more nervous.  That way if there's any problems it might be less traumatic and more likely that he feels okay getting right back onto the bike. Any other protective gear would be overkill, you tend to catch yourself on your hands or hit your knees when you fall off of a bike. After he's got the balance right, even with the pedals on, probably good to move to teaching a proper mount and dismount so that you can set the seat at the proper height.  On a cruiser or dutch style bike you can probably get away with keeping your feet on the ground when the bike is stopped, but in general you should mount by grabbing the brakes, putting one pedal at a 45º angle forward and up, using the pedal to step up to get onto the seat (and to get your other foot onto the other pedal), and almost simultaneously release the brakes so that the bike starts to move forward.  Dismount similarly (with brakes engaged and using one of the pedals to step off). There's a longer list of skills he'll need to learn before riding safely on roads, but balance, steering, mounting and dismounting is a really good start. Through all this, he needs to keep patient.  The simple reality is that it takes a while because you're trying to train your body into modifying its reflexes a little (so that you steer into a fall to keep from falling to the side).  If you try to think your way through balancing on a bike you'll fall over a lot because thinking is too slow, you need to retrain reflexes."
What pressure should I run my Mountain Bike tires at?,"Tire pressure is generally a trade-off between three things: If you are riding terrain where grip isn't too much of an issue (flat or low-angle dirt and dry rocks for example), then higher pressure will keep you going fast without pinch flatting. If you are riding steep downhills and/or on slippery open rock outcroppings, grip will be more important than rolling resistance, so use as little pressure as won't pinch-flat quickly. There is a 4th trade-off as well: weight. You can buy double-sidewall downhill tires that allow you to run very low pressures (such as 25psi) without any danger of pinch-flatting, but these can weigh almost double what normal cross-country tires do. As mentioned in other answers, your tires don't have to be the same pressure. Usually grip is more important on the front tire since most of your weight is on it while descending difficult downhill sections. Similarly, when riding on flat or climbing, most of your weight is over the back tire, so rolling resistance and pinch-flat resistance are more important for the back.  I personally ride with a low-pressure (30psi in a tire rated 35-65psi) double-sidewall downhill tire on the front and with a higher pressure (50psi in a tire rated 45-65psi) cross-country tire on the rear. I sacrifice some weight, but otherwise get the best of both worlds: fabulous grip going down and easy rolling on the flats and climbs. Use your best judgment in going below the rated pressure of the tire, as pinch flats become more likely. If you go below the rated pressure, be sure to test it out on hard impacts (such as a rock-corner) on easy terrain before throwing yourself at high speed down a mountain where a blow-out would be catastrophic."
Pack of dogs - best response to owner?,"To prevent this from happening again, this should be reported to the relevant authorities.  You were on a public road and in all countries I am familiar with, the dog owner is responsible for preventing their pets from interacting with public road users. If you are not sure which is the correct authority, report to all you think are relevant (eg. animal service, provincial/state authority if it's a provincial/state road, municipal police, etc)."
How many miles of riding require the same effort as one mile of running?,"If you want to do a competition which gives a (good runner, mediocre cyclist) even chances against a (good cyclist, mediocre runner) then you might use the same ratio as the Ironman triathlon. It has a 112-mile (180.25 km) bike and a marathon 26.2-mile (42.2 km) run which puts the ratio of distance cycled/distance run at roughly 17/4. EDIT: Based on questions in comments, let me clarify. I think 17/4 is probably well on the low side for a long race.  I've done a double metric century with 3km of climbing and ridden the next day.  I doubt I could run the day after a marathon on anything but a gentle downhill slope. For shorter distances though, it seems more reasonable.  If I push myself for 10km (6.2 miles), I expect it would take more out of me than if I hammered for 42km (26 miles) miles, but that's because I'm a better cyclist.  I think the hammering would take just as much extra out of some runner friends of mine. Weak cyclists can benefit from drafting a strong cyclist in a way that weak runners can't, but I think I'm strong enough to drop a strong runner/weak cyclist so that isn't a factor.  I would definitely try to have the ride first though, because otherwise the run might take enough out of me that I would have more trouble dropping a tail."
What do I grease and what do I lubricate?,"Chain lube goes on the chain. It's liquid and it drips on. We used to use ""oil"" for this but now there are lubes that are better engineered to provide lubrication without collecting dirt, washing off in the rain, breaking down chemically, etc. You also use this kind of liquid lube on brake pivots, derailleur pulleys and pivots. Probably not the same stuff you use on a chain although some products can serve both purposes. There's really not much more most cyclists need to do other than keeping things clean. The average consumer of bikes does not need grease. Grease goes on unsealed (loose ball) bearings - wheels, headsets, bottom brackets typically. However a lot of these bearings are sealed now so you can't service them you just replace them. Anti-seize compound is last. Like grease most consumers won't use this. Also, grease is often used in place of anti seize. This stuff goes on threads. Headsets, bottom brackets, pedals, and basically any little screw or bolt. It can also go on the seat post but you can also use grease for that."
Are there any bicycle computers that will log ride data?,"Garmin Edge-series computers coupled with Garmin Connect ... not inexpensive, but have traditional bike touch points (wheel and cadence sensors) coupled with GPS, logging and USB. Edge 205/305 are BW, 605 and up add color, ANT integration, etc ... all the modern bike computer features."
Carrying Pizza on a Bicycle,"For the ultimate in pizza carrying, you want a pneumatic air suspension, pendulum-based anti-sway bar equipped carrier. This are/were used by ramen delivery bicylists in Japan, although they are getting rarer (people don't order delivery ramen noodles like they used to) and mostly on motorcycles now:   With one of these babies, your pizza (or ramen) will not sway from side to side, bump around, and end up all mashed into one big congealed mess. Of course, it costs around $400 and you can only get it in Japan. But if you're serious about your pizza carrying, it's the only way to go."
Getting over a downhill phobia,"Easy answer....is to recover gradually. My experience has been in S.F., Seattle, and now Portland. All of which are hilly cities. Plus a lot of riding on mountain roads. So, I totally relate to your situation. ...and it's not always an easy answer. After spooky near-misses, and a few crashes...here's what I do to get my mojo back. That being said, I have watched some messengers scarily bomb down Nob Hill. Personally, I don't need to duplicate their endeavors; however, one can do those hills without riding the brakes. "
Is there difference in quality for disc brake rotors?,"One of the most advanced designs is the ""floating rotor"", made of two different materials connected together. They look like this:
 These are exceptional brake rotors. They are very rigid and won't bend sideways easily. Overheating is much less of a problem for these. If they are getting overheated, they don't bend that much because of the material expansion. Usually the spider in the middle is made of aluminium alloy, but you can get rotors with carbon core. Carbon ones weigh less, but cost a lot more than with alloy spider. Also you can get a full carbon rotor:
 These are very expensive. Marketing materials for these say they are perfect, but you can easily spend a lot of money only on one rotor. I have never tried a carbon rotor or even seen one in flesh, only on pictures. You can also get a combination of carbon with ceramic spider and other space-tech materials. kettlecycles.com provide with examples of these. (Thanks @J-unior for the link) One of the extremes I've seen is combination of carbon and ceramic in a disk brake rotor. Don't really think these are available in shops, but interesting to know. If you go for single piece cheaper rotor, then you don't have such a big variation in materials: they are generally made of stainless steel. And here the shape is making a big difference. If you get one of these:   You'd be able to stop on a dime, but you don't get a lot of modulation. These things will be like an on/off switch if combined with good pads. These are Hope trials rotors and I would not recommend using them for anything other than trials. (If you are doing trials, you should already know this) Then you have middle ground rotors with a lot of variations on patterns:  These are the most common and most affordable with prices from £12 to £25. I do believe that in this category there is really not much difference in quality. But make sure that the pattern has overlapping holes: when the disk is dragged through the pads, there should not be a continuous line of solid material. Pads should have a way to clean themselves and if in a section of a rotor there is no gap, the pads will not self-clean, decreasing the overall performance. In this category choose the ones you like most. And the last in the category are cheap and nasty rotors you get on bikes from Wal-Mart or Asda. They are usually heavy, easy to bend, with poor pattern. They look like this:   Apart from the material and type of construction don't forget that you have different diameters of the rotors: 145mm, 160mm, 180mm, 203mm and 205mm. The bigger the rotor, the more braking power you get and better heat distribution, but also the greater the weight. Usually downhillers go for 205mm rotors on the front and 180 on the rear. For more calm disciplines like XC 160mm rotors are more common. The size of the rotor must match your current one, but you can buy an adapter to place you disk brake caliper in the right position for the size of the rotor.  And you can get different types of mounts to the hub. The most popular is 6 hole international standard - on all of the rotors above. But you also get Shimano Centre Lock:  For this type of mount you need to have a hub with the same mount or use adapters from 6-bolt to Centre lock. 8-10 years ago there used to be rotors with 5 and 4 holes for mounting, but you can't get them now."
How can I improve my pedal stroke?,"Pushing and pulling and rhythm:  You'll certainly need clipless pedals - you won't develop a decent stroke if you're only pushing down on the pedal. You need to be pulling as well.  I would advocate spending some time riding a fixie, too. If you have to keep you legs moving, you will start to feel more connected to your bike and its speed.  Get yourself a cadence monitor and try to maintain an even cadence when in different gears. When you're not on your fixed, concentrate on spinning your legs. Perhaps try a gear or two higher than you might, purely to spin up a higher cadence. Also maybe trying a stationary spinning bike. "
Is it really OK to hang a bicycle by the wheel from a hook?,"So long as you don't use cheap 'pound shop' hooks screwed into some plasterboard to hang up a really heavy BMX (with pegs on the axles) then I doubt you will have any health and safety issues. Those 'pound shop' hooks are designed for hoes and other garden tools, not bicycles. You also have to be careful about what you are screwing into - your average hook will work well carrying weight if screwed into the ceiling, put it round 90 degrees into the wall and any weight applied is trying to shear it out. This should be okay with a quality hook but not with the cheapies. If you are a tenant then it might be an idea to ask the landlord first otherwise he will have another excuse to not return your deposit when you move out. But you wanted the bike's perspective. Posipiet has that covered - in summary it is highly unlikely that you will damage the rim if using a typical plastic covered hook."
Dedicated bike GPS computer over smartphone,"I used a phone for about two months, then bought a Wahoo GPS computer in March 2018.
The primary motivation was that Other advantages: Size and mounting. My phone isn't big, but it's much bigger than my Wahoo and I found it somewhat inconvenient on my handlebars. Battery life.  My Wahoo claims 15hrs. I probably get more like twelve, but that means I only need to recharge it about once a week.  Six hours of battery life would mean that, if I set out on a 4.5hr ride without having my phone fully charged and things took longer than I was expecting, I could easily be caught an hour away from home with no GPS and no way to call for help.  Which is to say... Redundancy. Having a cycle computer and a phone means that I have one device to keep me safely on the right track and a separate device that will give me backup navigation and, in the worst case get me help. User interface.  The Wahoo has six buttons. While I'm riding, I can press the buttons to get to the screen I want without looking, and then glance at the computer to find out what I need to know. Touch-screen navigation of the phone requires you to look at it and is awkward when things are bumping around. I put the phone inside a waterproof pouch (because, England) but found that made the touch screen awkward to use.  Touch screens are a pain with gloves, too. Crash resistance.  The one time I've crashed, my Wahoo (and my knees and shoulder) got scuffed up against the concrete in a way that I'm pretty sure would have wrecked my phone, but which caused only cosmetic damage to the Wahoo.  My phone was in my jersey pocket and was completely undamaged and available for use if I'd needed to take photographs or call an ambulance, or a friend or taxi to get me home. Of course, one can easily imagine  a crash in which the contents of one's jersey pocket get trashed, while stuff mounted on the handlebars survives. On the other hand, the phone felt much less secure on the handlebar than the Wahoo does. In other words, not much has actually changed.  The only thing I've not mentioned that came up a lot in the previous thread was screen brightness.  I guess my phone's screen brightness would probably be fine, but it was kind of moot, as I never did figure out how to stop it blanking the screen after a few minutes of riding.  I'm not sure how my phone would have coped with being in its waterproof pouch on a really hot day; I only used it in the English winter."
Why do we need air-filled tires?,"Is this a conspiracy of bike and wheel manufacturers, to maintain a steady demand for tubes and tires? No, because if it worked as well as you suspect, someone would have made it happen and taken all the money tube and tire companies are getting. The reason pneumatic tires continue to be used is because air itself is a great spring.  Additionally, being a fluid, it has the benefit that all of the air in a tire can work as a spring all the time. The rubber in the tire casing also works great as a shock absorber, and just like the air, the entire tire flexes at once, not just the contact patch, no matter which way the tire is oriented. These two effects mutualistically complement each other, and make the tire what it is. If you had a solid strip of rubber, only the rubber in the immediate area can do the job, so you'll either have a harsher ride, or a heavier tire. The same problem exists with other air-free alternatives as well. Now sure, you could make a full-suspension bike with a suspension tuned to make a smooth ride despite solid rubber wheels. But you'll quickly find out that such a suspension, both the changes to the frame, and the components, will be considerably heavier than a regular tire. And bikes are an application that is highly weight sensitive. Other applications, such as Tanks, have a different set of constraints and trade-offs, and so there tracks are preferred, and they have some pretty sophisticated suspension systems allowing them to drive over bumps and stuff at high speeds, because when hauling around 50 tons of armor, another extra ton for a good suspension is worth it. Sometimes, things stay the same way forever and ever because they just work."
Does drafting cause resistance to the lead rider?,"No, on the contrary the lead rider also gets a boost. The reason to be unhappy about someone drafting you is that they're too close to be able to react if there's a problem - if you go down they will run over you. The way I understand the boost is that a solo rider is effectively dragging around a volume of low pressure air - you push the air out of the way creating a high pressure volume in front of you, but that displaced air doesn't magically close in behind you, it flows out then flows back, creating a ""missing air"" volume behind you. If something fills in that space you don't get sucked back into it as much. There's a mention on wikipedia chain gang (riding) which links to the exploratorium article but not to a primary source that I can see. That explanation is common and makes sense, so I've never chased it further. Here is a link to a wind tunnel video which shows that the lead rider receives a small benefit from having a drafter. "
What to use to clean your chain (and cogs)?,"A degreaser, whether aerosol or not, is an excellent way to remove grease from the chain.  http://www.finishlineusa.com/products/citrus-cleaner.htm http://www.finishlineusa.com/products/speed-clean.htm The degreaser will reduce the amount of elbow grease required but be careful and use a set of nitrile gloves to protect your hands.  My simple chain cleaning method is as follows: Shift into the big ring and little cog, wet the rag with the degreaser Grip the chain (lower portion, going from big ring to the derailleur) with the rag, focusing on holding firmly onto the outer plates. Turn the crank putting the chain through the rag. Readjust as necessary as you remove grease and grime from the chain (ie. don't keep rewiping schmutz back onto the chain). When sufficiently clean, remove the rear wheel from the bike and place it between yourself and a wall (ie. tyre against your stomach/tyre against the wall keeping the wheel propped between yourself and the wall) over a garbage can.  Using a thin screwdriver or a cleaning tool ( http://www.parktool.com/products/detail.asp?cat=4&item=GSC-1 ) clean the grass and grease build up from between the cogs of the cassette/freewheel. Lightly apply degreaser to the brush portion of the tool and scrub at the cogs to free up the grease/grime. Using a rag, with degreaser on it, insert the edge of the rag between the cogs and 'saw' back and forth with your hands thus spinning the cassette and fully wiping the whole cog. I typically move from top to bottom of the cassette (keep the grime flowing downwards).  Wipe down cassette, hub and any spokes/rim that could have been contaminated. Reinstall the wheel in the bike and one last time wipe down the chain with the degreaser rag.  And typically ... that method suffices for cleaning any of my bikes. The one caveat is that I typically don't let the chain get grease/grime covered and thus this takes about 3-5 minutes max and works really well. The worse your chain, the more you have to do.  You might want to look at your derailleur pulley wheels and using a flat edge against the pulleys as you spin the crank, remove the grease rings from the pulleys. You might want to pre scrub the chain (similar to how you did the cassette) to loosen the grease/grime on the chain. A tooth brush w/ degreaser or the GSC-1 mentioned above would be sufficient. Andddd... that's about all I've got for now. There are a plethora of other methods using chain cleaning tools, removal and soaking of the chain and nastier solvents but for the majority this method seems to work fairly well.   "
Carbon bikes make me nervous. Can you ease the tension?,"Watch the Tour de France...you'd be hard pressed to find a bike that is not carbon. Yes pros do get multiple steeds, but remember riding is their full time job. When was the last time one of us put 30-50 hours on a bike in a given week, never mind for 6-8 months! Now think about the wattage these guys put out and hopefully you are getting the idea...that carbon is a proven material. Do failures happen? Yes, but the frequency is so minimal and when it does occur it is not the instantaneous snap in half you fear. Furthermore, no multi-million dollar corporation would be able to mass produce a product that posed as serious of risk as you suggest. As far as carbon forks go, I use them on the road, as well as, cross and have never had a failure. Their ability to absorb vibration is unparalleled and I honestly cannot imagine riding a bike without one. I have a stable of bikes and all have carbon except one and that one has a suspension fork. My 29er MTB has a rigid carbon fork that replaced a ti rigid a couple years ago! Now having said that, I have been riding carbon frames on the road for 5 years and the benefits are unbelievable. I used to have a carbon mountain bike and it was phenomenal. Carbon is not the end all and be all. There are other materials that ride extremely well.  Hope that helps!"
Do I really need to replace my helmet every 2-3 years if it hasn't been in a crash?,"The Snell Foundation says to replace after 5 years. The five-year replacement recommendation is based on a consensus by
  both helmet manufacturers and the Snell Foundation. Glues, resins and
  other materials used in helmet production can affect liner materials.
  Hair oils, body fluids and cosmetics, as well as normal ""wear and
  tear"" all contribute to helmet degradation. Petroleum based products
  present in cleaners, paints, fuels and other commonly encountered
  materials may also degrade materials used in many helmets possibly
  degrading performance. Additionally, experience indicates there will
  be a noticeable improvement in the protective characteristic of
  helmets over a five-year period due to advances in materials, designs,
  production methods and the standards. Thus, the recommendation for
  five-year helmet replacement is a judgment call stemming from a
  prudent safety philosophy."
"It it impolite to ""informally"" join or draft a group of cyclists?","It can be considered ""impolite"" by roadies, but not because of the bike you were riding or the fact you didn't take a pull (although I am sure some will argue for this).  The main reason random drop-in riders are generally frowned upon are because of: New riders can behave unpredictable especially in a pace line.  In the same way, groups can  behave differently than you might expect even if you are an experienced road rider.  Jumping into a group without knowing what they are doing can lead to unanticipated behaviours which may or may not result in a crash. From the groups perspective, they don't know if you are a stable rider or if you will try to ride too close and clip a tire.  They don't know if you will block one of them when they try to rotate their positions.  You are a complete unknown who has just shown up.  Most people are suspicious of unknown factors.   Likely they have also spent a lot of time training.  Maybe they are racers.  Maybe they are getting ready for a charity ride.  It doesn't really matter.  The last thing they want is to get taken out by someone looking for a quick draft or thrill. I was starting to get ready for for cyclo-cross a few years back in August and part of my route was on the road with a transition to some local trails.  On the transition from road to dirt I usually hopped off the road to the shoulder, scrubbed about 10 km/hr in order to make a sharp turn on to the trails. On the road I was in my drops plugging away on an interval when unbeknownst to me someone on a road bike had snuck up behind and was drafting me (my road section began at the bottom of a hill so I suspect this played a big role with suddenly picking up a rider). I was pushing hard on the flat so I suspect he was drafting tightly. When I sat up, to get ready to transition onto the shoulder, he collided into by back wheel.  I hadn't hit the brakes yet, but he must have been drafting me tight enough that simply letting off the throttle was enough to cause a collision.   Luckily we were both ok. I was livid that he was drafting me without notice and bent my wheel.  He was livid that I didn't continue my pull to where he figured I should finish (at the very end of the road). This belies the danger of an uninvited riders. NO COMMUNICATION had occurred between either of us as a result there was an unanticipated maneuver which lead to an accident.  NO COMMUNICATION while riding in close proximity is dangerous. For a number of years I was on the board of directors and/or running a large cycling club in western Canada.  Insurance, believe it or not, is an important consideration for a club.  We can't hold training rides or other official club events without it.  One of the Caveats is that everyone on the ride must be properly insured. For a new rider this can mean signing a one-time insurance form.  For other riders it can mean belonging to either our club or another club and being a member of the local cycling licensing organization.  If an incident happens and someone is injured (I have attended many  ambulance visits over the years from group ride mishaps) and it is caused by a rider that showed up uninvited this could void the insurance coverage.  We would have to prove that you were not invited, and that we didn't mess up our insurance forms with respect to your unofficial attendance.  If people are recovering from injuries the last thing we all want is to deal with lawyers and a court-of-law. All the above reasons may seem very unfriendly, this is not the intended effect, it is just the consequence of the world we live in.  If you are interested in attending a club ride, contact one of your local clubs (a quick internet search away).  You will likely find that:"
Is there a way to hop up onto a parallel curb?,"You're talking about a ""bunny hop"" and it can be done at speed on a loaded bike but it's high risk. You'd almost certainly be better off jumping off the bike and rolling. US Bike Trials call it a ""side hop"", but in anglonesia I've mostly heard it called a bunny hop.  Here's a photo of the 2006 Cycle Messenger World Champion doing more or less that at about 30kph, but wearing a backpack rather than panniers:  Note that at the world championships for people who ride loaded bikes fast all day about 3/4 of the competitors slowed down and used the pram ramp or just stepped up the curb (my photos are of the ones who took the more exciting approach, obviously). In this case they rode along the road, then had to go onto the footpath and turn very slightly onto a path, so slowing down to use the ramp definitely cost them time.  If you're expecting to do this, IMO you're better off learning to dive roll properly. Either through a martial art like aikido or ninjitsu, or through gymnastics. That skill will help you in a much wider range of situations than ""if I have a couple of seconds to get organised I can bunny hop"". Also, the most likely result of trying this is that you end up hitting the curb with the bike, then the pavement with your body. So rolling will be useful either way... For me, it took a slightly disturbing number of crashes in my late youth before I was seriously injured, largely due to my ability to roll (loosely speaking, via martial arts training). And when I did eventually break my humerus it was because a roll failed. Even now, I've been riding everywhere for 30-odd years and still my major injuries have all occurred through both my own stupid fault and in effectively single vehicle accidents. The ""hit by car"" ones have all involved a bit of flying through the air, a roll then a lot of very politely explaining to the motorist that I would like them to give me their insurance details. Now. THANK YOU. FWIW, I can do a hop like the one shown, on my commuter bike, with panniers, but only with careful preparation and a 90° approach. Jurgen's flying leap approach is not one that I'd try if there was any way to avoid it."
Direct Pull (V-Brake) vs. Center Pull Cantilevers (pros and cons),"The main reason that the direct pull (V brake) was invented is that it approximates a center-pull cantilever in terms of balanced force and leverage, while not requiring that the cable be anchored at some point above the wheel.  This is important for front wheels on suspension forks, but not significant for most other uses. Another slight advantage of the V brake is that it doesn't generally protrude out of the profile of the bike quite as much and is thus somewhat less likely to be damaged in off-road use. Neither advantage is of any importance for a road bike without a suspension fork.  However, there is the problem that the two require different levers (because the cable travel length is different) and the old cantilevered levers are getting hard to find, should you break one."
Why shouldn't I care what model/make/year my bicycle is?,"Most questions are based on a need for knowledge about what parts to use or curiosity. The latter do not make suitable questions for SE sites and will normally be closed.  For the former, fortunately the bicycle industry is fairly standardized (even if there are many and evolving standards), so knowledge of the bike make/model/manufacturer is rarely helpful in determining any maintenance issues and parts requirements. Ultimately the industry is dominated by a few parts manufacturers and a very large number of ""Bike manufacturers"", who largely build a frame to the standards of the day and attach components.  In most cases, a better question that will lead to more practical answers for the community should revolve around the specific problem that needs to be addressed. Photos of areas of a problem are almost always all that is needed to identify what components and work is required.  In rare cases its helps to know the bike manufacturer and model as some parts are very specific (e.g. Bottom bracket widths)  In cases of vintage bikes and none traditional bikes, knowing the bike manufacturer/make/model and year can help track down old and obsolete parts, and the real problem is solved by knowing this information. These are valid ""Identify my bike"" questions.  "
Explaining the effects of frame geometries,"I see frame geometry having 3 primary affects Since you asked, I'm talking about your basic on-road diamond-frame bike. Cruiser, road, commuter, urban, touring, racer... First off, the way a bike handles, ""stability"" and ""maneuverability"" are essentially opposites. It's a tradeoff. Whether you want stable or maneuverable depends on what you're going to do with the bike, how fast you'll be going, your riding experience, etc. And there's some more complicated harder-to-understand secondary effects. I really think that for most of the handling stuff you're best off just test-riding bikes that fit you. Experiment with the handling. Try going slow. Try going fast. Try making a sharp turn. Try making a subtle turn. Try a dodge/weave. Try those turns at different speeds. Try a fast start. Try a fast stop. Try all that in all the handlebar positions. Unless you're designing a bike, a lot of this is all very theoretical, heavily interrelated (can't really change one variable without changing the others), and likely to be very small differences when comparing actual bikes. Bottom Bracket (BB) height (sometimes you can find this out, sometimes you have to make a guess based on wheel+tire radius minus BB drop).  Higher bottom bracket makes it easier to go over stuff. Not really an issue if you stick to roads, but can be a factor when trying to pedal through sharp turns. Higher BB also lets you use longer cranks which some people want. Compare a Cyclocross to a Road bike and the CX bike will have a higher BB. Wheelbase length (distance between hubs/contact patches). A longer wheelbase will make the bike more longitudinally stable. In other words, less prone to wheelies and less prone to flipping you over the handlebars.  This could theoretically translate to better ability to stop faster. Note that one way to give you a longer wheelbase is longer chainstays. The position of your center of gravity makes a big difference, too. Headtube angle (steering axis angle). A shallower/slacker (more pointed forward) angle gives you more trail. A shallower angle also increases how much the weight can make the wheel flop on its own and negatively affect stability at low speed. This is usually measured from horizontal, so a steep angle will be closer to 90° and a shallow angle will be a lower number. Fork offset/rake (how far the front hub is in front of the steering axis). More offset gives you less trail. More offset also tends to give you more toe clearance. Trail is how far the front contact patch is behind the steering axis. Note that while the trail is the important measurement, the headtube angle and fork offset (and wheel size) are what determines the trail. A bicycle with no trail would be unrideable (but many people like having very little trail). There's different ways of measuring the trail (along the ground, or perpendicular to the steering axis) that make comparisons more intuitive, but more trail means more stable, and less trail means more maneuverable. Or to put it another way: less trail means more twitch and more trail means less responsive. The stability from trail increases as the bicycle goes faster. If you look at some cruiser bikes they'll tend to have a shallow headtube angle and a lot of trail: they're stable and easy to balance at low speeds but probably hard to steer at high speed. If you look at a road/racing bike, the headtube angle is usually much closer to vertical and the trail is fairly small: they may feel unstable and wobbly (hard to balance) at low speeds, but are still easy to steer (responsive) at high speeds. Note also that the handlebar setup and rider preferences/experience make a huge difference whether your prefer maneuverable/twitchy/responsive or stable/unsteerable/unresponsive."
Road bike carbon fiber frame life span,"Absent some kind of abuse or extraordinary stress (like falling on top of the bike while it's lying on the ground - stressing the tubes from the side, riding with a friend sitting on the top tube...) a carbon fiber frame should outlast the rider. Lennard Zinn covered durability of Carbon Forks for Velo News a while back.  Here are some quotes from that article in case the link breaks: From Kestrel For carbon forks in
  general, there should not be any
  limited life span, as carbon
  composites themselves are not subject
  to fatigue failures as metals are. So
  the fatigue life of a properly made
  carbon composite is 'infinite'. From Look There is no limitation because carbon
  has a natural flexibility. It can be
  used a hundred years while maintaining
  the same stiffness. From Easton The good news is the fatigue life of
  carbon fiber is immensely more than
  that of metals. While the writer
  expresses concern about his carbon
  fork lasting as long as a metal
  component, there is nothing to worry
  about in terms of fatigue life on a
  composite fork. Having ridden since the early 80's I've been through this twice, once with aluminum frames and now with carbon fiber. As high end competition bikes were made of the materials there were questions of durability.  Over time, as the frames became widely available, those concerns were shown to be largely baseless. I believe most frame builders warranty carbon frames for life now. I personally know of at least two riders with carbon fiber bikes that have been ridden in excess of 100,000 miles. That said, you should periodically inspect the frame for cracks and wear, especially at stress points like around the bottom bracket (just like you would with any frame)."
"Need cycling eyewear, but fogging is a big problem","I suffered from foggy glasses a lot, I prefer to wear clear lenses since I tend to ride after dark frequently. I tried a few of different cycling glasses with clear lenses, eyeglasses with anti-fog coating, motorcycle goggles, and several pairs of safety glasses with no luck. I finally found a pair of $9 MSA Safety Works safety goggles with anti fog coating that work well, don't fog easily, and have good peripheral coverage without obscuring my vision. They sit far enough off my face that they prevent fog when I'm stopped. So far this has been the best alternative to bulky ski goggles that I've used.
 One of the biggest things you can do for any glasses to prevent fog is to keep them clean and free of sweat, oil, and residue.  I don't know if this is the best method, but i tend to just clean my glasses with a touch of dish soap and rinse well. Don't use harsh cleaners like windex or alcohol which may strip the anti-scratch and anti-fog coatings. Also, do your best to avoid scratching your glasses, as this will make it harder to see and often can causes refraction when looking at light sources. I keep a glasses case in my bag for storage when not in use. "
Formula for Homemade sports drinks,"Maltodextrin.  It is basically pure glucose, which is the only sugar that your muscles can use directly without converting, so it's just pure energy.  It also has no flavor or sweetness, so it is completely inoffensive, and you can sweeten (or not) to your desired level. Look in any sport beverage and it will contain maltodextrin.  A lot of home brewing places sell maltodextrin and you can also get it from websites that cater to racing dogs (e.g. for the iditerod) as a dog supplement, but it's totally safe for human consumption."
What is the foam tube on the top of bmx frame for?,"It's to ensure that young boys who ride BMX bikes will be able to have children when they grow up. Fine print: More accurately, it’s to assuage the worries of the parents that are buying the BMX for their young male child that they might not have grandchildren. Actually efficacy for such purpose is under debate."
Why are male and female model bicycles different in the between-legs part?,"A triangle (i.e. a frame with a real top tube) is much stronger. As far as I’m aware the reason for women’s bikes is historical: Dresses and skirts. If you can, get a “men’s” bike with a real top tube. It will be lighter, stronger and easier to carry over your shoulder. “Women” frames often also lack bottle cage mounting points. There are some bike makers who no longer offer dedicated men and women bikes. I see no way for a man to hit their testicles on a properly sized frame, unless in a crash."
How to give away lights to cyclists without lights?,"We have had much more success advertising it and doing it through a local bike shop or bike group. Once each, so far, that I've done. I think the psychology behind refusing a gift from a stranger is much as Criggie says. You're some random dude approaching people at night offering second hand lights of unknown provenance. Why are you doing that? What's going on? Especially because you're also criticising them ""you, the idiot without lights, stop and let me tell you how to do it properly"". Yeah, nah. FWIW, I have your same issue with chain lube. Occasionally I'll ride up behind someone whose bike is in mortal agony and say ""I have chain lube in my pannier, wanna stop and let me fix that noise for you"" and hardly anyone will accept. The first time I was involved in a lighting give-away was when the Critical Mass fund I kept had more than a thousand dollar surplus and I decided I should do something with it. Critical Mass is an anarchy, so it really was my decision. While chatting with the owner of a bike shop at Mass we came up with the idea of buying a bunch of cheap-but-reasonable lights and giving them away. We talked to the local cycling promotion bureacrazy and they agreed that given 6-12 months to get themselves organised they could help promote it. We declined. I handed over the cash (my $1000, about $500 from the shop for lights that wholesaled at ~$5/pair when bought by the boxful), the shop ordered some of boxes of lights, I printed up a few posters and we put them up in the shop and along the bike route we were targeting. Then one winter night we set up a stall on the footpath next to the bike route, got 3-4 people to man it, and gave away about 300 sets of lights over 3 nights. We explicitly didn't stop people getting more than one set, but we did refuse a couple of people who were obviously going ""free stuff, give me everything"". That was very popular, and was sufficiently effective at promoting the bike shop that the owner went ""I can spend $500 on a 1/4 page ad in bike magazine, or $500 on free lights... the lights work much better"". Even people who didn't need or want the free lights thought better of the shop for the give-away. So a couple of years later the shop owner did a deal with the cycling promotion unit in the local council or state government or somewhere (I wasn't involved with that bit). The promotion people advertised it and put in half the light fund, the shop ditto, and we/they gave away another few hundred lights (I helped with this bit). The location was picked to suit the promotion people, but it was busy and also the site of a new cycle route. Again, very popular and effective. The difference is that we had an official-looking banner and multiple people, plus the signage/people were known entities. People will take a free gift from a local businessman, or ""that guy from Critical Mass"" who they see regularly, much more willingly that someone they've never seen before. It's about attributing motivation. ""it's a bike shop promotion"" or ""that guy is nuts about bike community"" is easy and people will just run with it. Having to think about why you're trying to press lights on them is hard."
Converting a MTB to a Road Bike,"A mountain bike will never really be a road bike. The geometry and construction of the frame is different. Mountain bike frames are designed for a different posture and are often designed for a suspension fork, as well as generally being beefier. You can set up a mountain bike with slick tires and drop bars if you want. I've tried this before and the ride quality is a bit off compared to a road bike. If you want to take it all the way, you'll need to swap out the following: All in all it's probably going to be a lot cheaper to get a used road bike and refurbish it than to convert an entire mountain bike."
How can I prevent bicycle theft while bikepacking?,"With multiple bikes, locking them together prevents them being picked up or ridden off. The latter is often the biggest risk when camping - simple opportunism. A reasonably long cable lock would lock all the bikes together (also outside cafes), and if you use it in an awkward position (down near the chainrings), getting cutters to it would be noisy, and tricky in the dark.  I like my Masterlock Python  for this sort of thing - it can be pulled tight meaning less stray cable at risk of cutting. It could extend into your tent locked to a bag right next to you, if you're worried. In fact even a piece of ground-coloured cord tied to the outermost bike and run through the grass into your tent, where it's tied to your bag or your cooking pots is an effective alarm; you're worried about theft in the dark, so mainly someone quickly picking up a bike and taking it away - if they make a lot of noise they'll run away empty handed. There are ways to lock bikes to the ground, which I've used while camping. I doubt they're necessary, but I've used this when leaving the bikes on site completely unattended during the day. What I've done is to buy two corkscrew dog stakes, and screw them into the ground as close together as possible. A cable lock run through the triangular handles of both (not the free-spinning leash points) and through the bike(s) is too stiff to allow the stakes to be unscrewed from the ground. If you lean the bikes against each other the right way up, with this arrangement underneath, you can also lock the top tubes together. It can be tricky on rocky ground. Another secure anchor is two sturdy stakes hammered into the ground forming an X, locked together through holes where they cross. This probably means carrying too much weight. Another suggestion, an additional measure, is to peg down a tarp over the bikes (and any other kit that won't fit into your tents).  This will slow down a potential thief, especially if you bang the pegs right down into the ground.  They either have to pull the pegs or cut the tarp,   before they can even discover how well-locked your bikes are.  In addition it protects your stuff from the elements."
When should you replace tires after getting a flat?,"From personal experience, I'd say a larger-than-usual hole in the tire could have these undesireable side-effects: Most of these somewhat larger punctures damage mainly the rubber and not so much the tire fabric (plies). If that is the case, a simple cautionary patch on the inside (with a regular tube patch) is enough to warrant peace of mind. If the tire is bulging around the hole when it is inflated at the pressure you use, that is a warning indicating the tire is probably too damaged. A larger or stronger patch might be used inside the tire, and some regular observation to see if it stabilizes or grows is needed, but most probably it would be better to get it off the bike (which is very sad when it is a relatively new tire). Hope this helps"
How do I keep my pants/trousers from getting caught in the gears?,"There are basically four solutions that do not involve extensive work on your bike: Since option 3 doesn't work for you that leaves you with options 1, 2 or 4. However, when applying the braces or clips, (or stuffing your pant-leg in your socks) are you taking care to make sure all the excess pant-leg material is collected on the outside of your leg, away from the gears? On the bicycle side: Chainring guards might help a bit, even better is a full chainguard but these may be hard to find for your bike."
What are the main improvements with road bikes in the last 23 years that the rider would notice?,"I coincidentally bought an aluminum road bike (Cannondale) about the same time as you got your Giant and with very similar specs. Mine was 3x8 rather than 3x7, but same size chainrings and similar gear range. I rode it until the frame was cracked in an unfortunate incident and replaced it with a relatively modern Felt aluminum bike with 2x10 gearing with a compact double chainring. I actually still use the 3x8 drivetrain components on a commuter bike. On the plus side, by 1998, many of the really substantive changes in road bike technology had already happened. Combined brake lever/shifters were standard, as well as dual pivot brake calipers, which have a lot better stopping power than some of the earlier single-pivot side pull calipers. So what's changed? Brakes Although disc brakes are not yet standard technology for road bikes, the trend is certainly in that direction. Disc brakes are not something that can be retrofit on an old frame, so if you want those, you do need to get a newer bike. The primary advantage of discs in better stopping power in rain and overall slightly more consistent performance. That said, the dual pivot caliper rim brakes that you have now have great stopping power as long as the pads are kept in good condition. The only reason I can imagine switching to discs is if you ride a lot in a group with other riders who have discs and you ride in the rain. In wet conditions, those other riders might stop more quickly than you can with your rim brakes and cause a crash. Or if you ride a lot on dirt roads, disc brakes have the advantage of not being affected if your rim gets muddy going through a puddle. Wheels/tires Another major trend in the last 20 years is a shift towards wider tires with lower air pressures, even among pro racers. Whereas most road bikes were equipped with 23mm wide tires or even narrower in 1999, now 25 and 28 mm are very common and many bikes have even wider tires. The high quality wide tires have no greater rolling resistance than the narrow ones, and the lower pressure makes the ride much smoother. Because narrow tires were standard in the 90's, many frames did not have clearance for anything larger than 25, so if you wanted to try wider tires, you might be limited. You'd have to measure your frame to check. And if you're happy with the narrow tires you're on now, it doesn't matter. Frame design As you noted, a big change since 1999 is the ubiquity of sloping top tubes. Frame construction has also changed a bit, so a comparable aluminum frame today would likely be a bit lighter than your current one and feel a bit less stiff, though road feel is generally much more dependent on tire construction and pressure than on frame materials. But unless there's something you don't like about your current frame, I doubt it's worth the investment to replace it just because the newer ones look different. Drive Train Better chainring design (ramps and pins) has enabled double chainrings with large differences in size, and the number of cogs in the rear continues to increase (now 11 is standard on expensive bikes). As a result triple chainrings have largely disappeared from even the lower tiers of expensive road bikes. The main benefit of the doubles over triples is weight, though. There isn't a big difference in performance. And counterintuitively, you may find yourself shifting between chainrings more frequently on the double than you did on the triple because the switch point is in the middle range where you ride most. On the triple, I find that I ride a lot on the middle ring and mainly only use the big when descending and the small when climbing. If you find your current gearing is a bit high for you, you can easily switch to smaller chainrings on the current setup. I've run 26/39/50 on those same Shimano triple cranks that you have that came with 30/42/52 originally. You should still be able to buy 39 and 50t chainrings with ramps and pins to work together properly, since Shimano sold Tiagra and Sora groupsets with 28/39/50 triples using the same BCD as the 30/42/52. A downside to the new drivetrains is that the narrow cogs and chains wear much more quickly than the thicker ones in a 7-speed set up (and are more expensive to replace). New cranks are also lighter due to the switch from square taper spindles to hollow spindles and external bearings. If weight isn't a concern for you, there's really no advantage. And of course, if you want to switch to a 2x11 drive train, all of the components can be put on your existing frame, so you can upgrade without changing the frame. Conclusion If weight is not a concern, the primary benefit to a new bike would be the ability to have disc brakes, which aren't even standard on road bikes now. You might find that wider lower pressure tires and lower gears make your riding more enjoyable, especially now that you're 20 years older than when you bought the Giant. But if you're comfortable on long rides the way it is, there's no need to change just to follow the trends. If you want to cut a bit of weight, you can do it by upgrading parts. Perhaps look at nicer wheels or switch to a hollow spindle crank and external bearing BB such as the Tiagra triple from the 3x9 speed era, which would be compatible with all your existing equipment. Just swap on your current chainrings and you're good to go."
Commuting: How to carry office clothing so it doesn't get crushed?,"You have two options, essentially: You can either carry each day's clothing on every trip, or store clothing at work.  Carrying clothing daily If you're going to do this, you'll need to find a way to roll up your clothing so it's not completely wrinkled. Be aware that even packing clothing in the most wrinkle-free way possible will still not keep it as fresh-looking as when you pull it out of the closet.  Many business travelers have found that the best way to transport clothing is to roll it. Do some searching, not on bike sites, but on business sites, and you'll find videos that get into this in more detail. But the gist: Fold along seams, then roll your clothing. The parts that must be least wrinkled (shirt collar, for example) should remain on the outside. You can also experiment with rolling around a towel, leaving some extra towel at the end and then rolling that around the bundle. This will become your clean-up towel at work.  As you're showering at work (or taking a sink bath), hang your clothing up and let it hang up a bit. Allow a little extra time for this.  It's worth noting at this point that many people continue to sweat even after they stop exercising, so you may want to wait ten to fifteen minutes before showering. (Riding gently for the last mile or three can also help.)  There are special cases that hold clothes, but they all (to my knowledge) involve folding them. I think that this will invariably crease the clothing.  Storing clothing at work If you have a spare closet or other space where you can leave clothing hanging at work, this is a great option. Consider doing a half-commute on Mondays, carrying the bike and clothing in, then riding home. On Friday, reverse the process.  If you have a space like this, you can also leave shoes there, and possibly even a travel iron for touching up clothes (if you want to look particularly sharp).  You might consider leaving a spare outfit at work in any case. I always worried that I would forget, say, underwear, or a belt, so I left an older set of clothing in my locker.  If your work doesn't have a space like this, look into nearby gyms. Some gyms will let you use the showers and locker room for a small fee, one that's smaller than a gym membership. Some larger businesses even have gyms on-site for employees.  It's worth noting that commutes of a mile or two may not require changing at all, but you'll still have these things to deal with in very hot or cold weather, or when riding in the rain. (Edit: Your 6k commute is a bit long for this, but it's still good advice in general.) Best of luck on the commute! Speaking from personal experience, I recommend allowing a lot of extra time the first few commutes, and also doing a dry run of the route (if you haven't already). Also consider talking to any cycling co-workers: Some of them may have solved the problems related to your specific workplace. "
How bad is switching derailleur gears under load?,"The answer heavily depends on the groupset construction/generation and personal perception of what is ""bad"", among other factors. Below are a few aspects that I am aware of. Switching gears in the traditional bicycle drivetrain assumes there is a momentarily side load on the chain, twisting it and forcing it to jump/fall from one cog to another. The chain is very flexible in one plane, but has limited sideways flex before the metal becomes too stressed. In the worst case, ""Unspeakably Bad Things"" is one of links of the chain breaking because of that excessive side load. Usually, bad shifting manifests itself as horrible metal clunking and abrupt pedal jerking, but nothing breaks (yet). Aside from the chain, similar side load is experienced by the cassette and chainrings. Similarly, a potential for bending individual teeth on them exists. The probability of a mechanical problem during shifting can be increased by several factors. Among them are: front-shifting while loading the pedals, back-shifting while pedaling hard, weak pin in the chain, fast shifting over many gears at once causing the chain to twist too much; misaligned derailleurs; worn drivetrain components; bad luck. Older (more than ~40 years old) cassettes were made of plain cogs without any features to help shifting. Recent cassettes and chainring have ramps and pins that assist shifting, making the opportunity window for chain overload smaller. Most modern MTB cassette designs were reported to greatly alleviate the problems with shifting under load in either direction, according to many reports I've seen on the net. Even for cheap Deore 12-speed cassettes, it is said to be safe to shift without taking it easy on the pedals. Your description of events ""to pick up speed, stop pedaling, then switch gears, then continuing pedaling"" applies to internal gear hubs, but not to the cassettes/derailleur designs. In order to complete the shift, one must keep the chain moving over the cogs, which means pedaling (even if with less effort) during the whole shifting process. In terms of practical advice, I'd say that there are several situations."
Least worn tyre: front or back?,"The Good or less worn tire should go on the front wheel as indicated in this Sheldon Brown Article on Tire Rotation Although the article does hint to the fact that you should not be really rotating tires to the front wheel that may have been used on the rear wheel. The only time tire rotation is appropriate on a bicycle is when you are replacing the rear tire. If you feel like taking the trouble, and use the same type of tire front and rear, you should move the front tire to the rear wheel, and install the new tire in front. The reason for this is that the front tire is much more critical for safety than the rear, so you should have the more reliable tire on the front. If you have a blowout, if it is on the rear tire, you have a very good chance of bringing the bike to a controlled stop. If your front tire blows, you can lose steering control, and a crash is a real possibility."
Am I too heavy for my road bike tires?,"Pinch flats are due to under-inflation of tires.  On a road bike you should be inflating your tires to 120-130 lbs. Also, you need to check and re-inflate your tires every time you ride.  I just keep my pump right next to my bike, and wind up adding air every 2nd or 3rd day. I see you added tire size - those are older bike tires, they don't inflate as high as road bike tires, I'd try pumping them to 65 lbs, and if you are still getting pinch flats, go up 5 lbs at a time until it stops.  You can tell a pinch flat because it will look like a snake bit, 2 small holes close together.   If you do not get any pinch flats at 65 lbs, you can try going down 5 lbs at a time until they return, then you know the range your tires need to be at to be properly inflated. The most important thing is to check tire pressure every time you ride, as bike tires can lose up to 5/lbs a week from just sitting.  These are high pressure tires, so they lose air much faster than low pressure car tires. Cheers,
Mike"
What bike+equipment for a long daily urban commute?,"Here I'll summarize everyone else's answers (because of all the Q+A scattered through in the comments), with some additional information that I got elsewhere from reading inspired by people's answers. Wheels+tires: 700 x (28 - 38, maybe ~30), tires; slicks or light treads, not knobbly. The larger wheel makes it faster (because of 'gearing') and the ride a little smoother (because of the 'angle of incidence' when rolling over an obstacle). Possibly puncture-resistant tires, especially if you experience many puntures. Reinflate them weekly. With the narrower tires, beware storm drains, streetcar tracks, dirt roads, and cornering especially fast and on wet roads. Clipless pedals and shoes: up to 35%-50% more efficient than without, but practice with them for 1/2 day to 2 weeks away from traffic first, because you must expect to fall off (everyone does). The normal type of clipless, for commuting, would be SPD: SPD are not impossible to walk in (unlike some other types). The stiffer the sole of the shoe, the better it distributes force over the whole sole of your foot. {Prefer a system which lets you clip onto either side of each pedal?} Gears: multi-speed (e.g. 7, 8, or even 14-speed) internal-hub gears cost $300+ (which is more than derailleurs), and tend to exist only on more expensive (above $1000) bikes; internal-hub gears means lower maintenance, chain is less likely to fall off, easier to have a chain guard even, and you can change gears while stopped, maybe 2% less efficient that derailleurs, and takes a different kind of chain. Derailleurs are more common. A 2-position rather than 3-position derailleur on the front would be adequate if there are no hills. Handlebars: as you wish (however, many/most people recommend flat instead of dropped); at commuting speeds it's more a matter of comfort than aerodynamics (and a more upright position is deemed more comfortable). Dropped affords more wrist positions; you can ask for interrupter levers on dropped handlebars, to access the brakes from more than one hand position/location. Brakes: disc brakes work better or more reliably than rim brakes, especially when the road is wet (or the wheel isn't true); and if you go downhill at 70 kph you might want hydraulic disc and not just mechanical disk brakes (hydraulics are more expensive, are difficult or impossible to self-maintain, require less or no maintenance or routine cable adjustments, and require less finger-force to actuate). Frame: not too important i.e. no-one offered advice on that; as long as (for speed) it's not a mountain bike, especially not a bike with suspension (suspension is inefficient). Aluminium isn't lighter than steel, because it's not as strong (and therefore there needs to be more of it). Aluminium is stiffer than equivalent steel, so (for comfort) higher-end bikes add (more expensive) carbon forks and/or seat posts to aluminium. Aluminium won't rust. Other equipment: lights; fenders/mudguards; rack and/or saddlebag and/or panniers; bike lock[s] (maybe one chain and one U-lock: not a cable, which is easy to snip); maybe mirrors (you can/should shoulder-check as well, but many/most urban bike accidents happen while the rider isn't looking ahead); maybe a trip computer; a tire pump, able to inflate to about 110 psi (so not just a little hand-pump); bus fare (in case of a flat or irreparable tire, or horrific weather). Store: find a ""good"" Local Bike Store (LBS), where you can meet the mechanics (a ""good LBS for commuting"" isn't necessarily the same as ""good for road-racing"" or ""good for MTB""). Pretty much any decent LBS will allow ~30 minute ride: take a few for a test-ride, before you buy, to see which one feels right. Furthermore, expect to pay at least $600/year in maintenance costs (as much or more than the cost of buying the bike), visiting the shop at least 3 times/year: which is another reason why it's important to find a ""good"" LBS. Speed: expect to average 20 kph at most, in the city, when there are stops and lights etc. Cost: a decent $700 (including brakes and gears but perhaps excluding 'extras' like lights) bike from a good store should be ""great"" (but it won't have internal-hub gears, nor hydraulic disk brakes, nor any carbon components) Additional comments or advice will be welcome."
What's the safest way to turn left from a right-side bike lane?,"By heavy I suppose you mean heavier than you'd like it to be, or heavier than you can live with comfortably. It's probably possible, sometimes, to change lanes beforehand, going to the left one to do the left turn, if the traffic is not so heavy, but that would, I think, violate your pre-condition that the traffic IS heavy. Then, the canonical way to do it would be getting to the margin of the flow (in this case, the sidewalk), and waiting for a comfortable opportunity (in this case, the pedestrian light). Turn left directly is a very bad behaviour, as it adds a lot of unpredictability and leaves a small time window and a small margin of safety for you and for any other user of the public way. Besides, as it seems, it is illegal. Hope this helps"
"What are the differences between ""clincher"" and ""tubular"" tires?","If you want simple and easy to fix then you sure as heck don't want tubulars.   Someone else will probably provide more details and links, but clinchers are rims/wheels with a tube, then a tire is mounted over the tube and the bead of the tire is hooked under a lip on the rim. Tubular rims have no lip.  The tire encases the tube completely and is sewn in typically.  SO fixing a flat means cutting open the tire and patching the tube, then sewing it back up. The tire assembly is glued to the rim. Heat from brakes can melt the glue supposedly and cause tires to roll off.  The rolling resistance used to be much better on tubulars.  Unless you are a purist or a pro I don't think there is a reason to go with tubulars these days."
What are the risks of untrued wheels?,"It is important to understand that spokes work in tension rather than compression. What that means is that the spokes at the bottom of the wheel are not 'doing anything'. The load is shared by all of the spokes to varying degrees and, particularly with cross-laced spoking patterns, that load gets dynamically transferred to use the strength of the available spokes. You can actually knock out a chord of a dozen spokes on the cheapest of steel rimmed wheels and the wheel will still be able to support your weight and get you home, albeit with gingerly riding style with no kerbs or potholes attempted... Therefore, even quite seriously mangled wheels that are as true as a poppadom are surprisingly strong when riding on paved roads in a straight line. As other contributors have noted the problem comes with the brakes and stability at speed. You really do want to make sure your brakes are not hitting the tyre or falling off the bottom of the rim. If you have the slightest doubt then you can ride the bike using the other brake as your primary, using the brake on the affected wheel for 'emergencies only'. This should not be a problem if the weather is dry and you know what you are doing.   Straightening out the wheel need not be something that you need to get the bike shop to do. Consider doing it yourself, with a spoke key on the wheel in situ. Here is a handy page on how to do just that: http://www.kenkifer.com/bikepages/skills/spokes.htm As for getting a spoke key, go into the bike shop with the bike and ask. There are a couple of common sizes and you will need to get the correct key for your bike."
Is there a difference in having tires filled with CO₂ vs air?,"This is a debate that gets picked up on every bicycle forum known to man (okay, that might have been exaggerating a bit). Typically you start to ask the question when you notice that the morning after you have used your CO2 cartridge, your tyre is ridiculously low.  By no means am I a chemist but, as it has been explained to me, CO2 and butyl are more soluble than N2/O2 and butyl. Most tubes are constructed from butyl (fancy pants cyclists will sometimes use Latex tubes, haha). Due to the increased solubility you can expect that a CO2 inflated tyre will need re-inflating sooner than one you pump up by hand.  http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/may98/895552329.Ch.r.html While the explanation above is dealing w/ escape from balloons I am going to assume that we can take that information and apply it to our discussion.  Now, if i am incorrect (which I often am) please let me know! I just noticed I didn't tackle the temperature issue. I do know that temperatures exceeding 50 degrees celcius (above 125 farenheit) can result in the potential for ... explosive fun, in regards to CO2 canisters.  http://www.stayfill.com  This company has a proprietary gas blend that won't leak from your tubes apparently ... ... ...

What is the purpose of the plastic disk between the cassette and the rear wheel?,"From Sheldon Brown: Spoke Protector A plastic or sheet-metal disc that fits between the cluster and the right-side spokes of a rear wheel. This is intended to prevent the
  derailer or chain from getting caught in the spokes, possibly causing
  very extensive/expensive damage/destruction to the wheel, the
  derailer, and the frame. A spoke protector is not a necessity on a bike that is well treated, because the derailer can't go into the spokes if it's
  properly adjusted and if it is not bent. Bicycles which are subjected
  to rough handling, however, are prone to getting the rear derailer
  bashed in, and in such a case, the spoke protector can prevent very
  serious damage. And from purely personal anecdotal experience: I have a friend that doesn't like spoke protectors and has been pretty vocal about it. Faith would have it that a maladjusted XTR derailleur wrecked his wheel and destroyed itself. A spoke protector would have prevented just that."
Basic toolkit for bicycle maintenance,"I would classify tools into two groups.  The ones you ride with, and the ones you keep at home.  There may be a bunch of overlap, but it is harder to work with a multi-purpose tool, so if you end up using one tool all the time, a purpose-specific tool may be worth the purchase.   Tools to carry with you: Tools for at home: Other Tools: That is everything I can think of right now."
How bad is road salt for my bike?,"For a one-off ride in the salt like that, you should be fine for now if you lube the chain and wipe it down. Give the bike a good washing whenever the weather warms up enough to turn on the outside spigot. In my experience of riding through road salt (and grit, which is probably just as bad) on a regular basis, the bike tends to need a new chain every spring, and a new cassette and bearing overhauls about every second year or so."

Is a recumbent trike faster than a non-recumbent bicycle?,"All other things being equal (which admittedly, they never are), a recumbent trike will be slower. It has more frontal area, more rolling resistance, and more weight.  I don't have a recumbent bike, but I do have a conventional racing bike and a recumbent trike (a very low-slung tadpole, not a delta). On a frequently-ridden 37-mile loop, my average speed on my racing bike is about 15.5 mph, average on the trike is 14.3 mph. So at the speeds and distances you're riding, the net time difference won't be that great. All that said, the trike is a lot of fun. "
Safety vests: Yellow vs. Orange?,"The short answer is that, in practical terms, the difference isn't great. The longer answer requires some explanation of ""visual conspicuity."" In optical engineering, conspicuity is the study of what makes things ""conspicuous,"" and some researchers split the tasks into ""detection"" and ""identification"" (see, for example, the works of A. Toet et al, such as this one). Because the rods and cones in our eyes have differential sensitivity to light and color, some colors are more easily detected in low-light conditions, such as dusk or dawn (the rods are more sensitive than the cones but are essentially insensitive to color -- that's why all cats are grey in the dark). However there's still the ""identification"" task, and that's where the choice among high-visibility, naturally-rare, colors matters. In general, in order to be conspicuous, you want both to be detected and to be identified as a cyclist. Experiments with the visually impaired (and color blind) show that contrast is the key. Contrast can be achieved by shape, motion (which is why emergency vehicles have blinking lights: to achieve ""optical"" motion), and color. What this means is that the color you wear should be differentiable from the background, so you want a color that is both detectable in a crowded visual field and also that is uncommon -- or rather, uncommon compared to other objects in the visual field but common to cyclists so that you can be identified as one (cf. here and here). The fluorescent colors of high-visibility yellow-green and high-visibility orange are pretty unnatural so the likelihood that it will be ""lost"" in the visual field is low but in addition, the fluorescent yellow-green seems to be commonly used only by cyclists and emergency workers (like firemen) -- at least, in the US. Conversely, hunters wear orange both because it's not just a good idea, it's THE LAW, but also because it's instantly identifiable by the conventions of hunting. So the bottom line is that both are detectable though there may be some (slight) advantage to using the color that is most commonly associated in the public view with cyclists since it is both highly detectable and also identifiable. Should you be riding in an area where another color is (predominately?) associated with cyclists you might decide, of course, to use that instead; for example, during some long-distance randonnees (see, for example, the requirements for the quadrennial Paris-Brest-Paris ride), the organizers may require that the cyclists wear a belt or vest or other device of a particular shape or color so that drivers can instantly recognize and identify the carrier of such a device as a cyclist.

My husband is a beginner in cycling and needs some motivation,"I had the same ""motivation"" thingy when I tried to keep my wife motivated in joining me during weekend rides. First we did a really short and slow trip around the city (about 4 or 5 km at such a slow pace that my legs were hurting). Then I tried to combine cycling with other activities we both liked. Being both foodies, I tried to find, in every outing, a convenient place for this. So for example once we stopped by to visit some wine makers, some other times we stopped for lunch break to a farm where we bought honey, fresh baked bread and local made cheese and had them for lunch, and so on. These small rewards for going out with the bike helped her in overcoming the struggle of the learning curve. You can try the same with your husband (assuming he has some passion which can be easily squeezed in a bike ride), and always try to balance the push to go a bit further with the awareness of what he can do without overdoing."
How much cheaper is cycling than driving?,"I commute by bike around 8,000-10,000 km per year and based on my book keeping it is at about 1/5th (or less) the cost of running a car.  After accounting for paying for the bike (i.e., devaluation) and maintenance (e.g., consumables such as chains, tires, etc), and under the working assumption that I will sell and buy a new bike in 5 years time. I projected the total cost of ownership on a per month basis about $136.  By comparison the Canadian Automotive Association suggested running compact car will cost you about $735 per month after insurance, fuel, devaluation and maintenance. As an aside, an interesting tidbit on bicycle cost of ownership was that consumables cost 3x as much as the cost of bike devaluation once you amortize over 5 years. NOTES  All calculations are in Canadian Dollars and Local Bike Shop prices.  Clothing has not been included, nor has food costs. Feel free to change or modify the Google Spreadsheet as these calculations are for the higher end of the commuter spectrum. This cost break down is for a higher end commute bike with high quality racks, fenders and lights (vehicular quality due to the need to ride at night down unlit paths).  These calculations assume the bike will be sold and replaced after 5 years of loyal service. Below is a photo of the bike  used to derive the cost calculations. It is pictured carrying a full load that includes work cloths, shoes, change of bike cloths, rain gear, computer, various papers, and food for the day.   These are the costs of buying a new bike and adding all the necessary components to make it a proper transportation machine, then the amount of money lost due to devaluation over the 5 year period. This was for a steel ""all roads"" road/touring bike that could take racks.  Because most bikes in North America are sold naked, metal fenders and good racks along with ""vehicular quality"" lights were added to make this a complete bike.  This put the total coast at $3230  After 5 years the bike (and all components) will be sold for approximately 40% of its original cost due to the higher devaluation in bicycles relative to cars.  This gives us a devaluation cost of around $406 per year or $33.83 a month!  These costs will depend on how much you ride and under what types of conditions you ride in. These costs are for a temperate rain forest where 30-40% of the riding is on dirt roads or paths which wears parts faster. Replacement mileages are on my records and are averages rounded to the nearest 500 km.  Some are conservative estimates and have been indicated as such. For the riding I do the cost in consumables is about $103 per month.  Just add (1) and (2) to derive the final cost.  On a monthly basis it will be about $136.41, compared to $735 for a compact car.  This is about 18.5% of the cost of vehicle ownership, i.e. the total costs of riding a bicycle per unit-distance are roughly 1/5th the total costs per unit-distance of driving a car."
How much of a difference do Toe Pedal Clips make in comparison to Platform Pedals?,"I found toe clips to be better than platform pedals, but not by a huge amount. Seriously, get clipless pedals. It doesn't matter how much traffic there is as it's so easy to get your foot in or out of the pedals. The advantages are huge. Once you get clipless pedals you'll never look back!"
Someone else's lock on my bike,"Another option if you're planning on cutting the lock, and don't want to leave their bike unlocked: If you don't want to donate your lock Also, if you really want to, you could try asking them to send you an electronic payment (cash app, venmo, paypal, crypto, etc) to cover the cost of the lock and the cutting tool rental, before you give out the location"
Padded saddle VS padded shorts,"Padded seats tend to have more padding than used at any given time. This pushes the other 'extra' padding into the soft tissues. This causes numbness and discomfort over time.  So slim hard seats are actually more comfortable over time, if they are the right size. You need to make sure your sit bones (ischial tuberosity) are well situated. The sit bones of your hips are designed to support weight for long periods of time, where a plush seat disperses your weight to muscles and other areas. "
Can using a trainer damage my bicycle?,"The only significant frame damage I can think of from this is your skewers -- the little nubs that grab on to the skewer and hold your bike inside the trainer have a tendency to scratch the hell out of the skewers. As far as flexing goes, all frames flex. The only time I would be worried about it would be if there was a grinding noise coming out of the crank -- but that wouldn't be caused by your trainer, that would just be impending crank failure. Oh, and rather than getting a trainer only bike, you should probably just get a stationary bike (if you do decide to go that route). They're typically much smaller because they don't have to have two wheels, and because they're designed for that use from the beginning they're typically much more stable when riding."
Best practices for commuting with rack & panniers,"In general panniers are more comfortable and efficient than carrying weight on your body. There are some things to be aware of, however. Safety. Every time you set off, make absolutely sure that all the pannier straps are done up. Apart from things falling out, the last thing you want is a loose strap getting caught in the spokes. This can wreck a wheel, and a rider! Regarding stopping distance, I don't think it makes much difference as the weight increases the friction between wheel and road. However, the extra weight does contribute something to heating the brake pads and rims/discs, but it's probably only an issue on long steep descents which are unusual on a commute. Panniers getting in your way. Yes, aim to keep your heel clear of the bags. This can be different when the bags are fully-laden as they tend to bulge further than expected. Worst-case you can pedal with your toes pointed down to avoid heel-strike, but this isn't comfortable for long. If you swing your leg over to get on and off then definitely take a bit of extra care to avoid pratfalls. Also be aware the rear of the bike is slightly wider. Left-right loading. Ideally it's nice to have them balanced, but unless there's more than 5kg difference between the sides, I'd say it's not really noticeable. So if all you're carrying is clothing and spare shoes, then it should be fine to take just one bag. However, if it's a stack of books consider two half-filled bags. Vibration and bumps. In my wife's experience, laptops seem to suffer from vibration in panniers more than rucksacks/messenger bags. Hers acquired a serious soundcard issue after being bounced in a pannier back down a slightly bumpy road. I'm not talking about crashing or dropping the bag, just riding the normal bumps in British roads. Your road surface may vary. Putting sensitive kit on your body is less comfortable for you, but more protective for the kit. Consider waterproofing. If the contents are sensitive to moisture (like the laptop), then you may want to double-bag unless you're really confident in the pannier's waterproofing. Tire pressure. Adding weight to your bike means you'll need a slightly increased tire pressure to prevent pinch-flats, particularly for the wheel over which the weight is situated. There's another question with some more information on calculating the best tire pressure, but ideally it should be done per-wheel and adding panniers to the rear will make this more important. The strap that runs from the middle with the hook on the end may be to wrap around the lower part of the rack (and possibly back up to the pannier). The aim may be to stop the pannier from swinging out away from the bike or from jumping off when you go over a bump, but in my experience if the strap is made of elastic it doesn't prevent this. The best design to stop the panniers hopping off is a clip which fully-encloses the top horizontal bar of the rack, as is found on Ortlieb and many modern panniers. If you want more detailed advice, post some pictures when you get the panniers back. EDIT: Looks like those panniers have non-elastic straps which is good news. I haven't tried ones exactly like that. You'll have to use your judgement as to whether they're secure and the straps won't fall into the spokes. Do not let them flap and fall into the spokes!"
How to calculate the capacity of a rear derailleur,"If you are asking how to calculate the maximum capacity of the chainrings and cogs, based on looking at the derailleur, then it's not going to be as easy as just looking at them. Finding a derailleur to fit your chainrings/cogs based on just the chainrings/cogs is going to be a lot easier than finding chainrings based on looking at your derailleur. HOWEVER, there are some standards for manufacturer, I have listed them below. I have also included the formula to find out your capacities, since I misread your question initially and decided to answer the part you weren't concerned with. I am not deleting it because, well, it took a while to type. According to United Bicycle Institute: Determine Maximum Chainring Difference by subtracting the number of teeth in the smallest chainring from the number of teeth in the largest chainring Determine Maximum Cassette Cog Difference by subtracting the number of teeth on the smallest cassette cog from the number of teeth on the largest cassette cog Determine Total Drivetrain Capacity by adding Maximum Chainring Difference to the Maximum Cassette Cog Difference Record the Maximum Cassette Cog (the number of teeth on the largest Cassette Cog) For Shimano: SS - Short Cage Road Double - Maximum Cassette Cog is 27 and Total Capacity is 29 GS - Medium Cage MTB/Road Triple - Maximum Cassette Cog is 34(MTB)/27(Road) and Total Capacity is 33(MTB)/37(Road) SGS - Long MTB - Maximum Cassette Cog is 34 and Total Capacity is 45 For SRAM: Short - Maximum Cassette Cog is 34(MTB)/28(Road) and Total Capacity is 32(MTB)/31(Road) Medium - Maximum Cassette Cog is 34 and Total Capacity is 37 Long - Maximum Cassette Cog is 34 and Total Capacity is 45 For Campagnolo: Short - Maximum Cassette Cog is 26 and Total Capacity is 27 Medium - Maximum Cassette Cog is 29 and Total Capacity is 36 Long - Maximum Cassette Cog is 29 and Total Capacity is 39 Note: This information is subject to change by the manufacturer. A great source for all of this is Sutherland's Handbook for Bicycle Mechanics (Repair Manual) 7th Edition."
What is the purpose of whipping a bike?,"Spinning wheels have gyroscopic effects. Whipping the bike can be a way to reposition the bike so that when it comes out of the whip, it is in an orientation that wouldn't be possible going over the jump dead-straight. This effect is large in the case of motocross. From a BMX perspective, it is very important to land on the backside of the landing ramp with the proper bend in your legs so that you can get the maximum ""pump"" off the landing. In some cases, especially in the case of a short landing ramp, it can be advantageous to do a slight whip and therefore land with the bike at an angle. This can get you more pump than landing perfectly straight. If you watch people negotiate a street spine, for example, you will see that it's downright awkward to go straight over without doing a whip. Also, there's often a corner and a berm shortly after a jump, so a slight whip can set you up for what comes next, vs. landing perfectly straight then having to muscle the upcoming corner."
Help Me Understand My Bicycle's Gears,"Don't overthink it. Since you've got a triple, you're probably right to be in your middle ring most of the time. That's normal. Here's a pretty good article on Wikipedia about bicycle gearing if you'd like to get more in depth."
Can I use a gas station air pump on a bike tire?,"The answer, in short is: Can you? In some cases, yes. Should you? In most cases, no. The long answer: The reason you can sometimes use an automotive air-pump on a bicycle tire/tube is because they share an identical valve. (See: Schrader valve/Schrader tube in the Terminology Index). If you have this type, you will definitely be able to get air into your tubes in a pinch. However, air hoses from gas stations are usually unregulated, high-pressure & high-volume, and lack a pressure gauge. Therefore, it is much easier to over-inflate and even blow out your bicycle tire, if you were to use one. An investment in a bicycle pump is one of the best you can make as a cyclist. Not only will it get you out of situations like this, but it will make it easier to keep your tires at the recommended pressure rating, which in turn will make it easier for you to be a more efficient (read: faster) bicyclist."
How to tell when it's time to give up on tires?,"This is a great question and there are actually some good ways of approaching it. Inconveniently, you need to see the tire installed and inflated to have high certainty that it's good for reuse. Until then, there could be casing issues (bulging, cracking that's worse than it looks deflated, distortion, etc) that aren't apparent when it's just a loose tire. However, there are heuristics you can exploit that allow you to do some pretty good screening even on loose tires. For commercial shops that save unwanted used parts and donate them to community shops or bike projects, a very common scenario is a customer that has a pair of old tires on their bike and wants to start fresh with two new ones. It is overwhelmingly common in this case that the rear is toast and the front still has life left. On the bike, the most direct symptoms to observe are the roundness profile at the contact patch. Worn out tires get pretty squared off, and if the front one was the same age you often have a good visual comparison between still-pretty-close-to-original in profile versus worn. (There is a tangential conversation here about the merits of rotating tires on bikes, but that is a religious question and most people don't do it so we'll leave it at that). If you're presented with two of the same tire and one is way less worn down the middle, it's pretty likely it was a matched pair, the rear eventually started flatting or having other issues or was just worn out, and the front is still usable. For that situation, throw away the more worn one and give the other a shot. Where it could be murkier is when whoever donates you the tires has done you the favor of already throwing away the rear and only giving you the front. There are pretty good odds that if it's a tire that seems weathered but not all that worn on the contact patch and with no other apparent issues, that is what's going on. Another approach is observing the thickness of the middle of the tire compared to the adjacent areas, where it's reasonably assumable that the starting thickness was the same as the middle. If the contact patch is a lot thinner than the tread areas that started at the same thickness, the tire is probably toast."
Why are tandem pedals mounted with the same position?,Sheldon goes into some detail on this. Having the pedals 180° out of sync would lead to a couple of problems:  A phase difference of 90° is used sometimes.  The power is more even through the stroke but handling is worse at low speeds among other downsides. Another post dicusses 90° out of phase and also slightly out of phase The second article suggests that most people ride exactly in phase because that's how tandems are set up by default.  Changing takes some getting used to and a little fiddling so people need a good reason to mess with it.
"Should my foot be able to step flat on the ground, when I sit on a bike seat?","For a standard bike in normal use you should not, from the seat, be able to touch the ground (without leaning, or except, perhaps, on extreme tip-toe). A standard diamond frame (with horizontal top bar), for road use, should be sized so that you can stand flat-footed over the top bar with a ""comfortable"" margin (but no more) between the bar and the stuff above the bar.  (A bike used off-road will generally be a bit more compact, and, of course, the top bar is often not horizontal.) The seat should be positioned so that your leg is almost fully extended at the bottom of the stroke (the knee should not go perfectly straight).   One way to fit the seat height is to have someone hold the bike while you pedal backwards with your heels on the pedals.  With your heels on the pedals the knees should go perfectly straight at the bottom of the stroke, but with no need to rock side-to-side to maintain contact with the pedals.  (Once you switch to using your toes on the pedals in a normal fashion the proper almost-straight leg extension is obtained.) Off-road, and for stunt riding, generally the seat will be a bit lower, and some may find it convenient to lower the seat a bit for city riding.  But be aware that a too-low seat puts significant strain on the knees and can lead to knee injury (especially when combined with riding in a too-difficult gear)."
Why are tubeless tyres popular in mountain biking?,"Although this is purely anecdotal, I know from my own experience mountain biking that most of my flats were from so-called ""pinch flats"" (where the tube is pierced by pinching or friction with the tire/rim rather than piercing by an external object). This was highly annoying. After having switched to tubeless some years ago, I've not yet had a single flat. And, obviously, without a tube to get pinched, there's no way to get a ""pinch flat""."
What is the most ecologically sustainable way to handle rags covered in chain grease?,"In response to a comment, I will be explicit with the answer. The most likely ecologically sustainable way to handle rags covered in chain grease is throw them in the trash. The contents of the chain contains not only the chemicals in the original chain lube, but a toxic soup of chemicals picked up from the road surface as you ride, especially if its wet. Washing these rags in another toxic soup of chemicals strong enough to clean them means a couple of problems - one, your washing machine is now contaminated with a toxic soup of chemicals that could end up on your cloths, and two - the toxic soup of chemicals is now running down the drain to where? Are your municipal pipes and treatment sites up to the task, or do these chemicals end up in the environment. You cloths could be ruined (what a waste, hope they are recyclable) and many of these chemicals are classed as carcinogens. If we pick apart the the environmental impact of you dying early from cancer, the is then benefit of one less person on the planet for a number of years, offset by the environment impact caused by cancer treatment of said person. One of the biggest problems of saving the environment is focusing on the small picture (the oily rag and cleaning it) and forgetting about the down stream effect (Cancer treatment, municipal treatment capability, energy used and carbon emissions to clean the rag and make the cleaning materials and transport them to your location etc). Without fully understanding the big picture, its impossible to know what the best choice is. If you still worried, consider how much contribution you are already making due to cycling. The rag reduced waste by ensuring maximum life of the bicycle drive line. Explore alternates to using a rag - what was going to happen to it before you used it for cleaning? Are the alternates any better than the difference between that and sending the dirty rag to the land fill.  Reality is it was probably going to endup in the landfill clean anyway."
"Is having your hands ""on the hoods"" of drop handlebars safe for braking?","TL;DR: Position: drop bars can be set up to match almost any reasonable flat-bar body/head position and hence visibility.
Braking: if you can squeeze your front brake from the hoods hard enough to initiate rear wheel lift-off on dry flat pavement - you're good. The long answer: Position: Higher body/head position will generally give you better visibility. An average drop bar bike (properly fitting) will give you considerably lower body/head position than average flat bar bike (properly fitting), but this is not because of the bars per se. Rather, the manufacturers know that drop bar bikes are perceived as more ""sporty"" and so a bike with relatively high drops (hence less aerodynamic position) will not sell as well. Still, road bikes with high-ish drop bars are available (look for touring or ""relaxed"" road bikes). If you want still higher body/head position, you can use stem risers and/or adjustable stems. I can't think of any reason for reaction time to be different between drops and regular bars if body position is the same. It's important to note, however, that higher body position means more drag and less speed; also, any position higher than touring will be less comfortable on longer/regular rides, and comfort affects safety. Braking: Whether some particular braking setup is safe enough depends on how quickly you can stop the bike in an emergency. Because a bicycle/rider system's combined center of gravity is so high and close to the front wheel, on clean dry pavement the most braking you can get is when the rear wheel is about to lift off. Unlike with a car or even a regular motorcycle, clean dry pavement always provides enough traction to do that on a bicycle while still not skidding the front tire. BTW, that also means that rear brake is useless in an emergency on dry pavement - so don't use it! Now, whether you can initiate rear wheel lift-off from the hoods depends on several factors - your hands' strength, your fingers' length, what type of brakes you use and, perhaps most importantly, how well tuned your whole braking system is (levers, cables, calipers, pads, rims/discs). If you can initiate that lift-off with conventional rim brakes, you can choose any bike you want (or keep existing one). If you can't, you can always upgrade something. Longer fingers are probably out of the question, and developing strength takes time, but better brakes are readily available. As of now, the most powerful solution would probably be SRAM RED 22 hydraulic hoods/levers and matching RED 22 disc brakes; much cheaper but probably just as powerful solution is TRP HY/RD hybrid (cable/hydraulic) disc brakes; there are also less integrated hybrid systems. The cheapest (and good enough for most) would be just giving your existing brakes a tune up. Sources: Sheldon Brown, personal experience and research."
Why has indexed shifting displaced traditional friction shifting?,"There is no 'conspiracy' to keep friction shifters off the market just so that you have to buy the index shifters. It is simply a matter of supply and demand. Nobody in the OEM market wants friction shift gears because bikes with friction-shift simply do not sell. That leaves the after-market and you have a similar position there - the demand does not exist amongst people building up bikes/repair old bikes. One reason why the replacement part market does not exist is that friction shifters rarely break, even 'back in the day' they were not a common spare for shops to stock in depth. As for your front-shifting problem, you do have the outer cage 'flat-bit' parallel with the chainset and clearing the outer ring by all of 1-3mm? Without that accurate positioning it is unlikely you will get your front mechanism to work. New cables help, and if you follow the Shimano/SRAM/Campagnolo manual to the letter, making sure no dropouts or derailleurs are bent, you will have a chance of getting optimal shifting. I know that a simple shift-lever adjustment would be easier, but that is progress for you."
How to get the tyre back on to the rim easily?,"It depends on where you are and the conditions. Youtube has some video's, such as this one:  

 My little tip is:"
Can you shift both the front and back gears simultanously?,There's nothing wrong with doing this. It works well to shift the rear 1 or 2 shorter when shifting the front 1 taller (and vice versa) to avoid big steps in gearing.
Are Penny-Farthings Legal to Ride on Public Roads (UK),"I ride a 50"" Penny-Farthing almost daily on the UK's public roads, both individually and as part of groups in daylight and evening conditions. Before venturing out onto the UK's roads when I began my Penny-Farthing journey, I asked myself this very question. And when people see me on my PF, many will invariably ask me: ""Is that thing legal to ride on the roads?!?!?"" Initially had to piece together an understanding from a gazillion different sites. This answer hopes to centralize this research into a single comprehensive, authoritative PEER REVIEWED source for riding Penny-Farthings on public roads in the UK ONLY. And save the reader the grief of hunting-down this information across many sources. Please alert me to errors or omissions you may spot in the comments section and I'll revise the answer accordingly. ""Yes"", but only if you observe all the traffic laws you're required to riding a regular ""safety"" bicycle (those odd things with symmetrical wheels) and your Penny-Farthing has the minimum safety equipment required by law (see ""LONGER ANSWER"" for specifics). A Penny-Farthing is a bike, albeit a direct-drive bike without symmetrical wheels, but nonetheless still a bike and subject to the same laws as any other bicycle ridden on Public roads. The (5) key Laws relating to bicycles - ALL bicycles - are: The Highway Code: When interpreting the Highway Code, the words MUST and MUST NOT imply a legal requirement. Anything not so qualified is advice. HOWEVER: If you're ever involved in an accident and find yourself in court, your failure to observe best-practice as advised in the Highway code could go against you; only a downside in not heeding advice in the Highway code if you are cycling on public roads. THE HIGHWAY CODE, Northern Ireland: Northern Irish Penny-Farthing Riders be guided by this. The Pedal Cycles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1983 The Road Vehicles Lighting Regulations 1989 The Road Vehicles Lighting (Amendment) Regulations 2005 The Pedal Cycles (Construction and Use) (Amendment) Regulations 2015 Older Penny-Farthings manufactured before these laws were enacted can be outside of them. However, most Penny-Farthings manufactured in modern times WILL necessarily be subject to ALL these laws. The guidance in this post is based on prevailing laws at the time of writing. Laws changes over time, and with the rise of ""e-Bikes"" I expect cycling laws will be revisited in the near future. Future readers are advised to give me a heads-up if anything becomes out of date and I will revise this answer accordingly. Braking/stopping on a Penny-Farthing brings challenges one doesn't encounter riding a ""safety"" bicycle where you can put your feet on the ground at a halt. Nonetheless you still must stop at red signals, yield to traffic on your right at roundabouts and signal changes of direction. If you cannot perform these fundamental operations competently on a Penny-Farthing, even if your PF is appointed with all the correct equipment which is described below, you shouldn't be riding it on the public roads. Regulation 7 of The Pedal Cycles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1983 defines the legal requirements for brakes on a pedal cycle. As a Penny-Farthing is a ""fixie""- a direct-drive bicycle where only one wheel is operated by the pedals. 7(1)(b)(i) of the statute requires only a SINGLE braking system. UPDATE: I asked Roger @ unicycle.com- who is the manufacturer of the popular UDC Penny-Farthings of which I'm a rider of- to review my answer for correctness and he states that  Rule 9.1 trumps Rule 7(1)(b)(i) in respect to brakes on a ""fixie"". 9.(1) Nothing in Regulation 7 or 8 applies to -(a) any pedal cycle so constructed that the pedals act on any wheel or on the axle of any wheel without the interposition of any gearing or chain; Front Wheel Brake: So according to Regulation 9.(1)(a), as the the pedals of a Penny-Farthing are affixed directly to the wheel to drive it in the absence of gearing, then negative resistance on the pedals is the only braking mechanism we require.  As a practical matter, it would be highly undesirable to have a mechanical brake on a Penny-Farthing's front wheel in any event due to the risk of doing a ""header"" and going over the handlebars if such a brake was applied too quickly and/or aggressively. Rear Wheel Brake: Although a braking mechanism is not required by law as the small rear wheel is not driven by the pedals or gearing, Penny-Farthings DO have at the very least a rear brake: the rider's heel. This is achieved by the rider standing on the mount peg and applying their heel to the rear wheel. This method may sound crazy, but it's proven and has been in use as a braking system by Penny-Farthing riders since the beginning. Newer, modern Penny-Farthings such as the UDC MK 4 ship with a calliper brake on the rear wheel. Nonetheless all PF riders should familiarize themselves with technique of braking the rear wheel with their heel! Testing & Inspection of Braking systems by Police: Regulation 11 of the same statute provides the mechanism for the Police to inspect any cyclist's brakes are legal. Police as a general rule do not randomly stop cyclists and checking their brakes. I expect the Police will do so if you are either involved in an accident or they observe you cycling out of control.

I ride my Penny-Farthing frequently at night, so I not only meet the legal minimums for lights, I seriously exceed them. ;-) Lights: Lights are NOT required when cycling in daytime. HOWEVER: If riding your Penny-Farthing (or any bicycle) between 30 minutes BEFORE sunset and 30 minutes AFTER sunrise, it must have: Front Light STEADY: Light must be WHITE in colour and emit STEADY light OR Front Light FLASHING: Whether a flashing light is approved depends upon whether it has additionally has a steady mode. If NOT, a flashing light CAN be used IN LIEU OF a steady white light.  If your flashing light DOES have a steady mode, then it's only approved if it conforms to BS6102/3. 
One flashlight set to steady the other to rapid flashing 
Note Rear Red Light incorporates a reflector that works even when light off 
The spine is too thick for most light mounts I got around the problem by using a silicone band bought on Amazon to attach; works perfectly.  Reflectors: I couldn't find any reference that states a bell is a legal requirement, but you'd foolish to cycle without one. And if it's true that it's a legal requirement to SELL bicycles with a bell (haven't been able to track down a link to this yet), the odds are you already have a bell anyway... EXCEPTION: Northern Ireland: a bell IS a legal requirement in NI, unlike the rest of the UK. If you toodle home from the pub pissed on your Penny-Farthing and are caught in such a condition by the Police, it can attract a £1000 fine. Although technically your vehicle license can't be endorsed with points or directly lost for cycling unfit, you could still lose your vehicle license. And if you are involved in an accident, I'm sure whatever cycling insurance you have will likely be invalidated. Who doesn't like toodling to a pub on a their Penny-Farthing for a pie and a pint? Just take care not to over-do it... Unlike a motor vehicle, cyclists are NOT required by law to have liability insurance. HOWEVER, strike some pedestrian who steps in front of your Penny-Farthing listening to music with their earbuds and you'll wish you did. And stopping a Penny-Farthing is a bit more challenging when responding to the presentation of a hazzard. Important Considerations: EXCLUSIONS to Look For: If the policy excludes direct-drive cycles- ones where the wheels are not driven by gearing as with a ""safety"" bicycle- then your Penny-Farthing would NOT be covered. Cycle Appointed with all Legally Required Safety Equipment: Ensure all the lighting, braking, and other safety equipment required by law is present and working condition. If the Police inspect your Penny-Farthing (or any cycle) after an accident and anything is found amiss, I suspect an insurer will jump at the opportunity to deny you coverage. Group Insurance vs Personal Policy: Many cycling organizations offer liability insurance with certain memberships. Getting group cover via an organization is less complicated and will likely provide better cover with fewer exclusions than taking out an individual policy. Also, if you can support organizations that advocate for cyclists, why not?!?!? I emailed British Cycling- who provides my liability insurance with my ""Ride"" membership- and directly asked them: I ride a Penny-Farthing- which is legal to ride on the UK's public roads.  However, this is a direct-drive bicycle- the pedals are affixed to the wheel and drive it directly in lieu of gearing. Is this covered under my membership liability insurance? They replied IN WRITING to this question that it WAS: Yes I can confirm you are covered on a penny farthing. So now I am 100% bullet-proof if anything happens.  I'd suggest asking for such a confirmation before agreeing the policy so there's not grief later if you're involved in an accident riding your Penny-Farthing. So I can confirm AT LEAST British Cycling DEFINITELY provide Penny-Farthing cyclists liability insurance with their ""Ride"" membership. In addition to the other links, I've consulted the below sources:"
Recommendation for panniers used off the bike a lot,"You might consider: You might check other products of those two producers, if you need a bigger/smaller cargo capacity. Both of these panniers are very easy to attach to your bike. Perfect for your daily commuting needs and running errands."
How Strong is my road bike?,"Good question - I went down the same path (MTB -> road bike) and was worried about having to be super gentle. But actually, a road bike is surprisingly strong provided forces are applied in the right direction. Riding off curbs or over bumpy surfaces shouldn't cause a problem, but I wouldn't suggest doing drops. Similarily provided your bike isn't a super lightweight frame (and it sounds like it isn't) fitting a rack will probably be okay (especially if the frame has mounts for them).  A lot of the pros on the Tour de France used their standard road bikes on the cobbled stages just with special tyres, and those stages were very bumpy. And the teams that used dedicated Paris-Roubaix style bikes mainly did so for comfort and speed, not strength. It's when you start applying forces to the bikes in ways that weren't intended that you are likely to damage it - i.e. riding into things, jumps or crashing. That's where the extra durability of a mountain bike comes in. It also depends on your weight - without being rude, if you're a big rider simple physics means you are going to stress the bike more. If you do do damage it may not be easy to see. Especially small cracks may be very had to spot, although if they get big they will be pretty obvious. I certainly wouldn't recommend assuming that just because you can't see problems there aren't any there - you really don't want your fork to fail at the crown which could cause a very serious accident. If you are planning to ride your road bike off road a significant amount you might be better off with a cyclo cross bike. It will be a little bit heavier but stronger and more capable of dealing with crashes, but more importantly it will enable you to fit much wider tyres, and gives much better mud clearance. Many cyclocross bikes have rack mounts on them as well, and the geometry is tweaked to make them more comfortable to ride off road. It's just my experience but as a mountain biker, I feel much more comfortable riding a cyclo cross bike - either on or off road - than I do a dedicated road bike, probably because the handling is better (for me)."
Bicycle left outside for over a year. Possible to save?,"You don't have pictures of the bike, but honestly, theres not much you need to worry about. Pump up the tires and make sure they hold air. Check that the brakes work (may need new pads, cables). Add a new chain and you're likely good to go.  A lot of bikes live outside their whole lives (in rain and snow) and aren't worse for the wear. "
Safety guidelines for cycling in traffic,"A lot of cyclists promote vehicular cycling in which you act just like a car, obeying all of the rules of the road.  This includes respecting all stop signs & lights, travelling in the same direction on the same side of the road as motorized traffic, and using the full lane (taking the lane), often ignoring marked bike lanes if they are too small or marginalized. To me, vehicular cycling means acting like you belong on the road and that you have the legal right to be there (which you do).  I think a lot of bicycle accidents happen because the cyclist is trying to stay out of the way of cars and in doing so becomes very difficult for cars to see."
In which orientation should a front wheel be installed?,"In my experience, a front rim is symmetrical, and it doesn't matter which direction it's in. Unlike the rear wheel, where there's a drivetrain side and a non-drivetrain side, the only place where the quick-release handle can be. However, there are some other considerations to keep in mind:  Tires will sometimes have a tread direction. This is usually marked on the tread itself, in the form of an arrow with ""direction of rotation"" indicated. If you put a rim on a backwards from how you installed the tire, that could be swapped by mistake.  In addition, it makes sense to have the quick releases for both wheels on the same side. I make sure when putting a tire on the rim to set it up so, if both release handles are on the same side, the front tire is in the direction of rotation.  Disc brakes may introduce other considerations; other answers on this page address this. Outside of that, it mechanically makes no difference what side the quick-release is on. "
How close do I have to be for effective drafting (while commuting)?,"I don't believe you can effectively draft and have enough time to stop.  I don't know the exact aerodynamics (and I suspect it's affected by speed and wind), but if you watch any paceline or peleton, they're never more than a couple feet (about half a meter) behind the rider in front, often only a few inches (centimeters) behind. With a crosswind or larger groupings, they're even likely to have wheel overlap (where the front part of the front wheel of the following cyclist is next to the rear part of the rear wheel of the lead cyclist). You can really only draft safely with the cooperation of the lead cyclist, who needs to signal back to you before starting to stop. Let's put it another way: Less than a sixth of a second to figure out that the lead bike is braking and to start braking, and that's assuming your brakes are as good or better than the lead bike's brakes.  If the lead bike has slightly better brakes (or wider tires, or grippier tires, or even just pulls the brake levers a bit harder than you do), you may simply have no reaction time available and a collision will be unavoidable. In other words: you definitely can only safely draft with the full cooperation of an experienced lead cyclist who won't brake unless they've warned you or being rear-ended by you is better than whatever they're about to run into.  If you were going to go by hazards, they'd need to warn you about upcoming hazards and you'd need to pull back to 10 feet (3 meters) or more. Additionally, you should simply stay entirely out of the door zone so that opening car doors aren't much of an issue.  It's not unheard of for car doors to open very fast with no warning, so that nobody has enough time to avoid hitting the suddenly opened car door. I haven't checked the laws of every single state in the US (and definitely not outside the US), but in general the area that parked car doors can open into (the door zone) constitutes a hazard that you're not required to ride through.  When a bike lane is in the door zone I'll either ride the line on the left of the lane (if that's outside the door zone), or simply ride in the right wheel track of the car lane next to the bike lane."
Why don't Tour de France riders always ride their TT bikes?,"There are 2 good reasons for this.  First, a TT bike is the most efficient machine for flat, fast course racing, where there are a minimum of hills. It is not the most efficient machine when it comes to climbing. The body position is far too aggressive for even professional athletes to use in a non-TT style event. A bike with more a more upright body position, a more stable weight distribution, a lighter frame, and far, far lighter wheels, is a more efficient choice for that style of ride. Secondly, a TT bike sacrifices bike handling for that extreme power and aero efficiency. The TT stages are controlled events, where there are either one rider, or one team on the course at a time, and so limitations on stability and handling are acceptable. Take the same bike in a 150 rider peloton, where riders constantly jockey for position, and where even on a stable bike losing focus for 1 second can cause a major crash, and all of a sudden, those same sacrifices in bike handling and stability are no longer a benefit for the rider or the team. They become a hazard to the team's chances of winning. And not just for the stage or the day, since a bad crash can take a rider out for the season. Or God forbid, permanently.  For these reasons, the UCI has seen fit to ban the bikes in non-TT events, in order to ensure rider safety. And for once, their decision makes sense."
How to carry a concealed firearm on a bike?,"Seems like stuff made for joggers could work for cycling. Would a small triangle frame bag work?

What are my options for cycling mirrors?,"Bicycle mirrors are going fall into two basic categories- the type that you mount somewhere on your bike and the type that you mount somewhere on your head. Both categories have their pros and cons, but many of them are subjective. A pro to one individual may be considered a con to the next. Within those two categories you have a variety of different options to choose from. Here's the breakdown of those that I am aware of.  One thing to keep in mind with head mounted options is that they are always in your field of vision. You may consider this a pro, or you may consider it a con. On one hand you don't have to look off of your course of travel by much to view the mirror, on the other hand it can be distracting to always have it in your field of vision and can be awkward to focus on. Head mounted mirrors always look directly behind where your head is pointed. That means that they're not always pointed opposite your direction of travel, i.e. the road and traffic behind you. Depending on how far away from your head the mirror is, it can be difficult to get the mirror adjusted in such a way that your head does not obstruct your rear view or to where you are not looking off to an extreme angle to view the mirror. Mounting can be finicky. On the plus side they tend to be very light weight and tend to stay adjusted for the duration of your ride, and they are generally less obstructive than most bike mounted mirrors. Your options for head mounted mirrors are: 
Helmet mounted mirror are typically affixed with an adhesive pad or with a clamp to the front-side of your helmet. Typically they will stick out a little further than other head mounted mirrors, which is a good thing. It allows you to more easily see around your own head and you do not have to look off to as extreme of an angle. For adhesive type mounts the downsides are that the adhesive mounting point is (or is supposed to be) permanent and can potentially damage the helmet if removed. For some helmets it can be difficult to find an adequately flat surface to attach the adhesive pad to. The adhesive mount, if not appropriately attached, can fall off. If properly attached the mounting point is, in theory, permanent, although typically the mirror and the arm are removable from most mounts should you not want to use the mirror. Some of the same types of problems can arise from the clamp style helmet mount mirrors. The clamp has the potential to damage the helmet- though it is unlikely if you use due caution- and there may not be an appropriate mounting point for many helmets. If not adequately attached, the clamp may loosen and fall off. 
Glasses frame mount mirrors are similar to helmet mount mirrors in many ways, but typically sit closer to your face. This can make it a little harder to see around your own head or cause you to have to view the mirror at a more extreme angle. Mounting is easy and they are not permanent. On the other hand, they will not fit all styles of glasses and many of the plastic models are prone to breaking. Metal framed models are available which are less prone to breakage. 
Lens mount mirrors adhere to the inside of your glasses. They look great because onlookers can't tell that you are using a cycling mirror, and mirrors have a bit of a stigma attached to them, albeit undeserved. The downside to these mirrors are that depending on the shape of your glasses and the shape of your head, you might not be able to see anything with them besides your own face. It's also worth pointing out that if your require corrective lenses (not contacts) then this option is out by default. If this style of mirror works for you, you are likely in a fortunate minority. 
 This category of mirror will be affixed somewhere to the front of your bike. They will not be in your field of view at all times, which depending on your preference may be mark for or against this category. You will have to take your eyes off from your course more so with a bike mounted mirror than with a head mounted mirror, and to varying degrees depending on where the mirror mounts. Bike mounted mirrors will be easier to look at since you can more easily focus on them with both eyes instead of largely just one as with head mounted mirrors. While riding in a straight line the mirror will always be pointed mostly behind you, but in turns they may point off to one side a little or a lot (the frame mounted mirror described below is the exception). Mounting points tend to be more secure than head mounted mirrors, however bike mounted mirrors have more of a propensity to stick out from the bike in some way. Hand in hand with that issue, bike mounted mirrors can be more of an obstruction than head mounted mirrors both in terms of getting in the way of your hands and in terms of getting knocked against things. 
These mirrors have a plug that fits into the end of your handlebar to secure it in place. Many sit up higher than the bar itself, though some models are inline for a cleaner look and less obstruction of the hand(s). These mirrors are typically the easiest to view of the bike mounted mirrors due to their height and the distance out from the bike and rider's body. The other edge to the blade is that they are likely the easiest to knock into something, and depending on their shape they can get in the way. Some models will fit both flat bars and drop bars.  
These mirrors work the same way bar end flat bar mirrors work and some models fit both bar styles. For the inline style as pictured above, you get some tradeoffs. The mirror is less obstructive and a little less likely to get bumped into things, but to view it you do have to take your eyes off the the road in front of you more so than with a mirror that sits up higher. Due to the fact that drop bars are narrower than typical flat bars you may end up looking at your leg or bike, especially when turning in the same direction as the side of the bike the mirror is mounted on. 
There are a couple of different mounting options for this type of mirror- one for integrated shift/brake levers, and one for non integrated levers. Both manage to bring the mirror up higher and further away from the bike, giving you some of the advantages of a raised flat bar style mirror. For the non integrated style lever, these can be a good option if you have bar end shifters. The mirror will still be a little tighter in on the bike, and both types of mounting options run the risk of damaging the lever in the event of an impact. 
These typically have a plastic clamp, or a rubber or velcro strap to affix them to a handlebar. They are an option if you have no other available mounting points on your handlebars. On the other hand, chances are if all other spots are taken, you will have a hard time finding a place where this type of mirror won't be in your way. 
This is a somewhat unusual option that mounts directly to the frame of the bike. It will always look directly behind your direction of travel, regardless of where the bars are pointed, and it obviously won't take up any room on your handlebars. This may be a good option for time trial and triathlon bikes where mounting options on the bars are virtually nonexistent. The biggest problem with this kind of mirror is that it is going to be very difficult to see around your legs as it sits in so tight to the bike. I have not used this type of mirror, but I believe there could be a slight risk with some configurations of knocking against the mirror when out of the saddle and climbing steep ascents.



Keep in mind that you may or may not find that any of these issues actually affect you. Preference is going to play a huge part in your decision. Most cycling mirrors are cheap so if you're unsure of what will work best for you, buy a couple of different styles and try them while you ride."
How do bicycle power meters work?,"There are several different types of power meter on the market and each measures something slightly different in order to make their estimates. In addition, the way that they measure what they measure has implications for their accuracy. Below I discuss what the major models measure, how they measure it, and the implications for accuracy.  Power is the rate of work (so you need to know the amount of work and the span of time over which that work is done), and work is a force exerted over a distance, so each power meter has a different way to measure those forces and, because of patents, each has chosen to measure them in a different ""location.""  With the exception of the iBike, most power meters measure the forces somewhere along the drivetrain: working from the back to the front, the PowerTap (and the old Look MaxOne) measures at the rear hub, the older Polar systems measured along the chain, the Quarq, SRM, Rotor, and Power2Max measure at the spider of the front chain ring, the new Look/Polar and Garmin Metrigear (thus far, announced but unreleased) measure at the pedal spindle, the (announced but unreleased) Brim Brothers measures at the shoe cleat, the Ergomo measured at the bottom bracket, and the Stages measures at the left crank. The iBike measures in a completely different way, discussed below. One consequence of measuring at various points along the drivetrain is that drivetrain losses will (or won't) be accounted for to a different degree; for example, a PowerTap will usually read lower than a SRM since one is ""upstream"" of most drivetrain losses while the other is ""downstream."" This difference is more of a definitional issue than a strict ""accuracy"" issue (in the sense of, ""is gross income or net income a more 'accurate' measure of income?"" Unless you have a specific use in mind, it's hard to say which is more ""accurate""). Most of the power meters on the market use strain gages, which are small thin foil strips whose electrical conductance and resistance varies as they are deformed. Strain gages are used in lots of applications (like, bridges) and their properties are well-understood. In general, strain gages are combined in a ""rosette"" or ""Wheatstone bridge"" in order to produce more accuracy and precision (more strain gages usually produce better results), and, when operating properly the Power Tap, Quarq, and SRM are usually accurate to within a couple percent (and, just as importantly, with high precision); this has been verified both statically (using known weights hung from the crank) and also dynamically (using a large powered rolling drum in a lab). The forces are then combined with a measurement of angular velocity or speed to get power. A virtue of strain gages is that the change in resistance can be measured even when the device is stationary so the cyclist can measure the accuracy of the strain-gage-based power meters at home by hanging weights of a known mass from the crank. A common problem with the strain gage approach, however, is that they can be sensitive to changes in temperature and so need to be ""re-zeroed"" prior to (and sometimes, during) rides. The old Look MaxOne's achilles heel was waterproofness, not the strain gages or method of measurement. For example, the original Power2Max (and the old discontinued SRM ""Amateur"" model) uses fewer strain gages than the current PowerTap, Quarq, or SRM models and reports from users (subsequently admitted to by the manufacturer) showed that it was more sensitive to temperature drift during a ride than those others. The Power2Max was redesigned and updated in late 2012 and reports are that the temperature problem has been largely addressed. A claimed feature of the Stages is that it is designed around automatic temperature compensation — as of early 2013 this claim is still being evaluated by users and it is too early to know if their approach does what it claims.  The old Polar power meter measured the force transmitted along the chain by chain tension, and included a chain speed sensor to get total work. In a chain higher force transmitted along the chain results in higher tension, and tension can be measured by the resonant frequency of the object (for example, plucking a highly-tensioned spoke with your fingernail produces a high frequency tone while plucking a loose spoke produces a low tone). As an historical aside, the proof-of-concept prototype for the Polar chain tension sensor was the pickup from an electric guitar. The chain speed sensor fit on one of the derailleur jockey wheels and could count the ""pulses"" in the magnetic field as the chain rivets passed; since chain rivets are a known distance apart, chain speed was easily calculated. As for accuracy, when the Polar was operating well, it was very good; however, when it wasn't it was very naughty indeed. Worse, it was often hard to tell when it was being naughty. The downfall of the old Polar power meter was three-fold: 1) the chain tension sensor needed to be close to the chain, which was hard to achieve since the chain sometimes had to be in the large or small chain ring or the large or small rear cog; 2) the chainspeed sensor sometimes got overwhelmed and gave false speed readings; and 3) incomplete weatherproofness in part due to exposed wires and a poorly sealed ""pod.""  The Ergomo bottom-bracket based power meter used an optical sensor and a series of ""peek holes"" to measure torsion in the bottom bracket. An odd characteristic of this design is that it could only measure the (torsional) force traveling through the bottom bracket; thus, it only measured the power contributed by the left leg: to get total power it doubled the left-leg contribution. In conjunction with the difficulty in installing and calibrating the Ergomo (it had to be installed just exactly so), this dependence on bilateral symmetry between the legs was the death knell for the Ergomo. The Stages power meter similarly measures force by deformation in the left crank, and doubles the ""left"" to arrive at an estimate of total power. Research with instrumented force pedals shows that bilateral asymmetry in power production between the right and left legs is the norm — worse, the research shows that the asymmetry can change with the level of effort. However, some riders are willing to accept this inherent inaccuracy and imprecision.  Because neither the old Polar nor Ergomo power meters used strain gages, their accuracy and precision could not be statically checked in the field by the cyclist; they could only be checked dynamically (or against anotheher known-calibrated power meter).  The unreleased Garmin Metrigear and Brim Brothers pedal or pedal cleat power meters are rumored to use piezoelectric sensors and solid state accelerometers rather than foil strain gages but until they reach the market all claims about accuracy or precision should be taken with grains of salt. An interesting problem in the design of a pedal- or cleat-based power meter is that the direction of force and the position of the pedal spindle must be known: for example, if you add downward force at the bottom of the pedal stroke, that is wasted force since it does not aid in moving the crank in the correct direction; likewise, if you press down (however slightly) on the upstroke, that will cancel out some of the force exerted by the other leg on its downstroke. Keeping track of the various force vectors is therefore key to getting reliable accuracy and precision. To some extent, the Stage power meter can also occasionally be susceptible to a related problem: the Stages uses a solid-state accelerometer in the pedal (similar to the solid-state accelerometers one can find in smart phones) to determine its position. Early production models of the Stages were plagued by imprecise measurements of pedal position, so pedal speed was also imprecise — and this had repercussions for the precision of the final power estimates. The recently released (as of January 2012) Look/Polar power meter uses strain gages arrayed along the pedal spindle, and each pedal must be carefully installed so the pedals know which direction the forces are being applied -- a special tool is supplied with the pedals to help with the orientation. To simplify the conversion of measured forces to torque values, the Look/Polar pedal allows the use of only four different crank lengths: 170mm, 172.5mm, 175mm, and 177.5mm. Cranks shorter than 170mm are currently not supported. One pedal is the ""master"" and the other is the ""slave""; the slave pedal transmits information to the master which then bundles data from both pedals and forwards it to the head unit. At the moment, the Look/Polar pedal uses its own transmission protocol and no other manufacturer has yet signed on to provide compatible head units. Early reports on the new Look pedals confirm that the orientation of the pedals is critical: because the spindle of a pedal is small, a small absolute error in alignment can be a large relative error in its angular orientation.  The iBike takes a completely different approach: it calculates power indirectly. That is, you need a certain amount of power to overcome changes in potential energy (climbing or descending), for changes in kinetic energy (accelerating or decelerating), to overcome aerodynamic drag (including the wind) and drag from rolling resistance so if you know ground speed, gradient, wind speed, your total mass (you plus bike and all equipment) then combined with estimates of the coefficients of rolling resistance (Crr) and of aero drag and front surface area (CdA or drag area) you can calculate the overall power (see, for example, here). In essence, the other power meters on the market focus on the ""supply side equation"" by measuring power supplied by the rider somewhere along the drivetrain; the iBike focuses on the ""demand side"" by measuring power demanded to move the bike against wind, gradient, and other drag forces. Under normal conditions, this can be quite (perhaps even surprisingly) accurate, though the precision of the power estimated in this way is not as good -- the iBike assumes that the aerodynamic drag area (aka CdA) is constant, so if the rider changes position (say, moving from the drops to the bar tops) or if the wind speed differs because the yaw angle changes, the power estimate will be off. In general, the iBike has been shown to be quite accurate for hill climbs; less so for rolling courses or riding in a pack, so the overall accuracy will depend on the exact mix of riding done and the variability in the direction of the wind. As with the non-strain gage based old Polar and Ergomo, the iBike cannot be statically checked for accuracy or precision; worse, nor can it be checked on a dynamic rig in a lab since it depends on gradient and wind speed. Checks of the iBike have been performed in the field when riders have mounted another power meter on the same bike and compared the two data streams. There have been a few ""simultaneous"" comparisons of power meter accuracy where one rider mounted two or more power meters on the bike and went on structured or unstructured rides. You can see one such ""Rosetta Stone"" comparison here and here. In general, all of the commercially released power meters have been accurate (and sometimes precise) when newly-adjusted and performing under ideal conditions. However, conditions are not always ideal and parts get damaged, dirty, and deteriorate. If accuracy and precision are important then the ""design"" accuracy (whether based on strain gages, optical sensors, magnetic sensors, or wind speed sensors) is only half the battle: equally important is the ability to verify a power meter at home so you can tell when they're off.

What are some good tips for riding in a large group?,"Group rides of this size and speed often consist entirely of racers. If a steady double paceline hasn't formed, then to be more specific, this is one of those rides that is, in effect, a race itself. So with that in mind, so some general thoughts about these types of group rides:"
What should I look for in clipless pedals and shoes?,"Pedal Selection Pick a system that will work well for your current and future use.  It's annoying to have different shoes for different bikes.  My experience is limited to Shimano SPDs and Crank Brothers systems -- both of these work very well for road and mountain biking.  The shoe cleat is similar for both systems and is fairly small, which means you can use it with shoes that allow recessed cleats.  Very nice to be able to get off the bike and walk like a human being rather than a duck. If you're just starting out with clipless, definitely get double-sided pedals (some ""road"" pedals only clip in on one side).  If you think you might still occasionally use the bike with regular shoes, consider getting a pedal that also has a normal platform. One other thing to keep in mind: float.  This is how much freedom your foot has to rotate.  Some folks like almost no float, others like/need plenty -- I need lots for my peculiar pedal stroke.  If in doubt, err on the side of more float, your knees will thank you. Shoes Like regular shoes, fit is very important so make that your first priority.  Remember that your feet swell later in the day so don't try shoes on first thing in the morning. Also look at sole stiffness.  A completely rigid sole transfers more power, but is more awkward to walk in.  A partially rigid sole is a good choice for touring where you're not likely to pack a pair of normal walking shoes.  I have a pair of each but much prefer the rigid soles for normal riding.  Both pairs have recessed cleats. Practice Once you get your nifty new shoes and pedals: practice, practice, practice!  You need to be able to unclip on either side at a moment's notice.  Practice coming to a stop and unclipping -- better to get it right when you're not in traffic trying to stop at a light.  That said, you will probably still have a few falls.  It normally hurts your pride more than your body and this phase should wear off after a few months."
How many miles and/or commuting seasons will a modern internal geared hub last?,"I bought a 700c Jericho hardtail in 1997, which came with a Rohloff 14 speed internally geared hub. I used it as a commuter for five years, at least 150 miles per week, 50 weeks of the year. That's 37500 miles. Even assuming I took a week or 2 out in there for whatever reason, call it 35000 miles. After that, I continued to ride it one or 2 days a week, for less strenuous rides. I have just sent it back for its first major service, other than lubing and cleaning the external components.  The Rohloff is a ridiculously burly hub. The Alfine, or the i-Motion9 would do well to match half that performance. But I'd say based on people I've sold bikes with Nexus or Alfine hubs, and how rarely we see them for service, and how much more rare it is that they need major service, that 20000 miles is not too much to expect. The Shimano and SRAM hubs are both user serviceable, unlike the Rohloff, which should extend the useable life significantly also. I was trying to find any formal service interval information, but both SRAM and Shimano say that aside from cleaning off the external parts, the hubs are ""well sealed"" and the service interval should be ""long"". Sheldon Brown's site also says, ""Service should be quite rare on these well sealed hubs."""
Touring load weight distribution,"We can generalize the main areas where one can load weight as such: The most commonly accepted points for load distribution are as follows: I haven't used a handlebar bag myself, but the same logic applies. Weight in such a bag will have a very high center of gravity, as well as the ability to turn with you. Therefore, it might be a good place for maps, snacks, phone/keys/wallet, patch kit, etc."
What are important items for a touring first-aid kit?,"I bring enough to dress small cuts and stop bleeding, at least until 911 could get to me. If you're riding in areas you might not be able to be reached by emergency services, or if you have particular medical issues that need specialty supplies, a kit like this would insufficient.  Other things you might consider are snappable heat packs, a knee brace, and something to put on bug bites or poison ivy for rides in the woods. If you're allergic to bee stings, you might bring something for that. "
Why do left pedals have inverted thread?,"The reverse threading is to counter precession, not friction from the bearings. The wiki page explains it well (and I doubt I could): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precession_(mechanical)"
What is the difference between different types of disc brake pads,"Youll run into two types of metallic pads- sintered metallic and semi-metallic. The term ""metallic"" without any modifier gets used for a couple of reasons- a) many manufacturers don't offer both varieties of metallic pads for a given brake, so the type is implicit, and b) lots of folks don't know the difference or think the terms are interchangeable. They are similar, but different: Sintered metallic pads offer the best stopping power, but also cause the most rotor wear and can make the most noise, especially when wet. They are also the least affected by adverse conditions. Sintered metallic are typically used in downhill/freeride applications, but can be used for less demanding riding types as well. Depending on the setup, sintered pads can feel ""grabby"", that is, that they lack modulation at the lever. That problem tends to arise on more powerful brakes with larger rotors though, and both of those factors play towards that perception. Semi-metallics are a tradeoff between braking performance and pad wear/noise. They still stop very well but can be a little less noisy and cause a little less rotor wear. They may also offer better lever modulation than sintered metallic pads. This pad type can often be found on higher end all-mountain, trail, and cross country oriented brakes, though some manufacturers opt for sintered pads while others may opt for organics. Organic pads are the kindest to your rotors and typically quitest, but don't offer the same bite as metallic pads. These pads also wear the quickest. This does not mean that they're low end pads though, and depending on conditions, riding style and personal preference they may be a great choice. Organic pads can offer the best lever modulation of the three pad types, but may not stop riders sufficiently in demanding circumstances."
How to tell when to replace cassette?,"Without experience, or obvious damage, a cassette gauge like the one from Rohloff, or mileage are your best options for deciding when to replace a cassette. For me, a good rule of thumb has been: That is, I change my chain every 1200-1500km. I change the cassette on the 5th time I change the chain. And I change the chain ring set every other time I change the cassette. This is an example of an obviously worn chainring.  This is an example of a worn cassette. "
Are MIPS helmets actually any safer than standard helmets? Independent Research?,"Summary Research into brain injuries has been ongoing, but tended to focus more on direct impacts. In the last 70 years there has been more research into rotational brain injuries, and in the 1990s and 2000s scientific, evidence based proposals were made to reduce these. The Multi-Directional Impact ­Protection System is an implementation of these, and it's effectiveness has been validated by independent research.  Discussion There is lots of research into brain injury. While much of it has focused on direct impact leading to scull fracture, the effects of sudden head rotation have been studied since the 1940s. These (pay-walled papers) are typical A study on rotational brain injury (1984). Physical model simulations of brain injury in the primate (1990). Such studies progressed to proposals, such as A proposed tolerance criterion for diffuse axonal injury in man (1992). KINEMATIC ROTATIONAL BRAIN INJURY CRITERION (BRIC) (2011). [In] 2008 ... Swedish neurosurgeon Hans Von Holst, along with mechanical engineer Peter Halldin, developed a new technology called MIPS (Multi-Directional Impact ­Protection System).  A couple of (non independent) articles are  New Helmet Technology Reduces Brain Injury  MIPS Mips has been received with acclaim Precious Protection (2010). Senseless: An In-Depth Look at the State of Bicycling Helmet Technology (2014). There has been at least one study of their effectiveness  But not everyone is convinced regarding helmet effectiveness. For a helmet skeptic's view see Certainly, more independent validation would be good, and in future better designs could appear. At present MIPS seems to set the brain protection benchmark."
Wrong way on a bike lane?,"In general, if a bike path (lane) is on a road, follow the direction of traffic on that road. If there isn't a bike path on the other side, then bike carefully in the road if permitted, or find a different route.  If a bike path is separated from the road and there aren't directional signs, stay to the appropriate side of the bike path depending on where in the world you are (right for most of the world, left for fans of the queen typically). If there are bike paths on both sides of a road, use the direction of the closest bit of road.  Do not go the opposite direction of what is marked! (*) In the original post, there was an arrow indicating what direction traffic on the bike path was to go; in this case, it should be obvious -- follow the marked direction."
How can you speed a road-bike up?,"Gabe,  If you love the frame, and are willing to spend the money to keep it, start upgrading everything else.  Start with: Wheels/tires - rotating mass will slow you down the most - go to aluminum wheels and thin/light tires size 23 or 25. Bottom Crank - Once again rotating mass, you can get some hollow core cranks, and adjust the chainring sizes to the biggest you can push.  You can save a few grams by going to a compact crank versus a triple. Shifters/derailleur(s) - get some aero shifters/brakes, and upgrade to a lighter front/rear derailleur. Seat post, handlebars, stem - On an old raleigh, they are probably steel - you can get inexpensive aluminum replacements. Seat - get rid of the OG heavy seat and get something more comfortable and lighter. From expensive and most effective, to least expensive/effective, thats the list off the top of my head. Good luck on your decision, and keep those old Raleighs going, they are great bikes :)"
Bicycle designed for one-arm usage?,"There are devices that allow a bicycle to be modified to make it easier and safer to ride with one arm. Riding safely would come with practice and confidence.  Trikes or recumbents mentioned in the comments offer a safe alternative also. The key modification needed for a bike is a steering damper. The damper adds resistance to steering by way of a spring and helps slow down movement. It relieves the twitchiness of one armed steering. Steering dampers vary from a rudimentary spring based system such as the Hebie 695
a more sophisticated elastomer spring like the Hebie 696  or the hydraulic Hopey system.  Other modifications include mounting both brake levers on one side to allow single hand usage and using 1x gearing with a single shifter. (or in the case below a 3x9 in an over/under shifter configuration)  There are a few online resources such as NotBroken which show both modified bikes and riders who use a single arm such as Tom Bannister."
What should I carry on day trips for emergencies?,"In my opinion, minimal set of what to carry: Basically, the most likely problem on the road is getting a single flat.  The next most likely is getting two flats (running through some glass that gets both tires or not getting the first flat quite fixed right).  So you need to be able to handle a flat and preferably two.  If you have a few small bills (or an energy bar wrapper) you can use one to temporarily patch the tire if there's a big hole in the tire itself. I like having 1 tube and a patch kit because swapping a tube is faster (especially with slow leaks) and it's possible to get a flat you can't really patch (too big, valve stem sheared off while pumping, etc). After that everything else is much less likely to go wrong.  Brakes having an issue or the saddle sliding back are possible.  Running out of energy is possible. But those other non-flat things are unlikely enough that being able to call a friend or taxi or something like that is a sufficient backup plan. That's a small enough set of things you can carry it in a jersey pocket or saddle bag. Pump can mount next to the water bottle cage or might fit in the bag."
Why might a compact drivetrain be frowned upon?,"While Machismo answers the question asked, the reason why there is that reaction is mainly a lack of understanding about how and why compact cranks exist.  Obviously, you can look at it and say to give us better climbing (easy) gears. But what many people miss is the rear ratio changes. The race standard for many years was 53/12. That is, the hardest gear, made up of the largest tooth count in the front, and the smallest in the back, was a 53 tooth front chain ring paired with a 12 tooth rear cog. A few years back, Shimano started making an 11 tooth rear cog. It was originally intended for pro racers and time trialists.  Somebody got out the calculator, and realized that with that 11 tooth rear cog now available, you could decrease the size of the front rings, and get the same gear ratio, or slightly faster. That decreased front ring size allowed better climbing ratios when paired with the large cogs on the cassette, but also maintained the high gear speed racers are used to.  Someone riding a properly setup compact crank, actually is pushing a harder, faster gear than the 53/12 ""standard"". That said, if you pair a 53 with the 11 tooth, it will be faster yet, but not often do you find the legs to push that combo.  I've included gear inch charts for both, so that you can see for yourself how it works out. If you are not aware, gear inches are a comparison to the effective diameter of a direct drive wheel, when gear advantage is accounted for.   "
Is it really safer to ride in the road than on the sidewalk?,"In most scenarios, it is not safer for you to ride on the sidewalk. This has been demonstrated numerous times in numerous studies. I won't attempt to site individual studies here, but I will sum up the reasons. One is that you create more potential points of impact. When you exit the sidewalk to go through an intersection, driveway, or parking lot entrance/exit you are in danger from the cross traffic as well as parallel traffic making turns. The latter danger is greatly reduced if you ride in the street simply because you are in the same lane as those drivers. Furthermore, drivers simply aren't watching for cyclists on the sidewalk. Cyclists typically move much more quickly than pedestrians and drivers aren't prepared for that. Cyclists seem to ""come out of nowhere"" as compared to slow moving pedestrians. Pedestrians are also able to stop much more quickly if a driver doesn't see them. All that said, there are some situations where cycling on the sidewalk is safer. Personally, if the speed limit is under 40 mph, I typically ride in the street. If it's over 50 mph, I typically ride on the sidewalk. If it's between 40 and 50 mph, I judge the road based on how many entrances and exits there are, how wide the shoulder is, how much traffic there is, etc. Mike Baranczak said it beautifully in his comment, ""Riding on the sidewalk is always a bad idea. But sometimes riding on the road is a worse idea. You have to decide based on individual circumstances."""
Are there real-life alternatives to the chain+derailleur combo?,"Belt drive + Internally Geared Hub is a popular combination. Existing systems are based around a gates carbon belt drive. See the Breezer Beltway series bikes. Also Reeb Cycles began offering belt drives for mountain bikes when they first came to market. Also, now there is a breakable belt system called Veer that doesn't require a frame cutout (though uses cogs somewhat different from older belt drive systems) which could be used in configuration with an internally geared hub (when their new pro-version comes out). Currently it appears to be singlespeed only.  Though this is still rather similar to a chain drive system, there is less regular maintenance needed to keep the drivetrain clean as wear is not as damaging on the belt drive system. Performance is different with an IGH hub though.  There are also shaft driven bikes which engage with a standard internally geared hub (instead of a cassette like mechanism). See related SE question with some detail. Any experience with shaft driven bikes?"
Can road bumps excite frame eigen frequencies?,"Below are a couple of hypothetical graphs of the response of a bike to being acted on by a driving force at a particular frequency.   The unrealistic one on the left is the kind of graph that would lead to the pop-culture scenario where the bike breaks apart due to resonance. The resonance has to be at a pretty low frequency to match the frequency of the bumps in the road. There is very little damping (internal friction in the bike-rider system), and this shows up in two ways: (1) as you'd expect intuitively, the response is higher because energy isn't being dissipated rapidly into heat; (2) less intuitively, it makes the resonance peak very narrow. The second graph is more like what I would expect for a system like a bike frame coupled to a rider's body. Because the frame is a complicated object, it has many resonant frequencies, not just one, and each one is fairly weak. I expect that the resonant frequencies would be rather high, probably 100-1000 Hz, and higher, because the frame is stiff and light. There is a lot of damping, due to coupling of the frame to the rider's soft squishy body, coupling to the tires, and possibly also due to internal friction in the frame. This damping makes the peaks not very tall, and also makes them wide, so they blend together. If you want some experimental evidence about this, take your bike and bang on it with your fist in various spots and in various directions. (I guess you want to do this while sitting on it, since your body affects the system with its mass and damping.) If there are resonances in the audio region, you'll hear those frequencies as audible sound. If there are low-frequency resonances, you'll feel those as vibration. You can tell the amount of damping based on how long the ringing sustains. If it rings like a bell, you have low  damping. If it's a quick thud or ""dink"" that immediately drops off, you have high damping. Even if you assume the worst-case scenario of the left-hand graph, the peak is very narrow. (To make it tall enough to destroy the bike, we have to make damping low enough so that the width becomes very small.) This means that the hazard would occur only at a very, very specific, small range of frequencies. I think if most of us experienced this while riding, we would instinctively slow down a little. That would cause the driving frequency to drop and immediately take us too far from the resonant frequency to excite any significant response. Designers clearly would not want to make a bike that would vibrate with low damping in response to a vertical force from a bump in the road. Such a bike would oscillate up and down for a long time, which would be annoying. Even in the case of a mountain bike that has shock absorbers, there is probably a ton of damping designed into the shocks in order to avoid just this kind of effect."
I keep breaking my road frames - why?,"It is very likely that you are putting too much stress on the frame when you are cycling due to your power stroke. It took me a long time to train myself to avoid standing and powering the bike through the acceleration of starts, or even powering through it while sitting.  I've long since learned that while I have plenty of power, I actually am able to transmit it more effectively to the wheel using a faster cadence with lower power. Try to start out in lower gears so that it's easy to get up to 90rpm quickly (quickly, as in within dozens of feet, while you are still accelerating).  If you don't know your cadence, or have an easy way to measure it, the disco tune ""Stayin' alive"" is just over 100bpm.  There's a lot of other music you may be familiar with that is about 90bpm, you can do a google search for ""90bpm song"" and you'll find lists such as this: http://www.edenathletics.com/90bpm The location of the stress fractures really suggests that you are standing up to push more power into the pedals.  If you are doing that, stop standing - road bicycle frames are not meant to take the pounding that this type of riding entails.  The standing position puts a tremendous amount of force on that particular joint, and the pedals are not long enough to really transfer that energy into the chain - you are wasting a lot of power flexing the frame.  It you are a fan of geometry and physics, imagine putting the frame on two stands where the wheel hubs are usually located.  Now place a bouncing 1/2 ton load on the bottom bracket.  You'll find the stress fractures are disturbingly similar to the ones you are experiencing - the two triangle shape of the frame will force the top tube and seat up, while the bottom bracket is forced down, leading to fractures in the seat tube.  If the seat tube is strong, you may instead fracture the chain stay on the chain side. If you prefer that riding style, however, then you'll have to settle for mountain biking frames, which are designed for powerful stroking techniques.  This is one of the reasons messengers often use mountain bikes - they are standing up a good portion of the time with very powerful strokes to accelerate in very short bursts.   While spinning doesn't allow such high acceleration it is much more efficient in transferring energy from you to the forward motion of the bike.  And you can still stand up and accelerate if a situation calls for it, but doing it often is going to fracture your frame."
What to wear when it's cold?,"I have a continuum of clothes that I add on as the weather gets colder. During the summer, I ride like you do with shorts and a t-shirt.  As things cool of a little bit, down below 60F/15C, I'll put on a windbreaker over my t-shirt and some full-finger gloves on my hands.  The next step for me is to add an Under Armour Cold Gear shirt (many companies make equivalent tops) but to stick with naked legs, they're doing all the wok after all. Once temperatures get down to the 45F/7C range, I'll add som snazzy leggings in a fabric similar to the Under Armour top mentioned above.  When things start to freeze, my final move is a fleece vest over the long sleeve top, but under my windbreaker. If things get even colder where you are, Icebike's clothing page is a good place to look for further advice.  Keep two things in mind: you need a lot less clothing once you're moving and generating heat than you do standing around, but you also need to be prepared for a problem that might leave you standing around for some time.  Dress light and carry extra clothes in a backpack."
Does it make you safer to use lights during the day?,"According to Safety effects of permanent running lights for bicycles: A controlled experiment. (Madsen JC1, Andersen T, Lahrmann HS.) they give about a 19% reduction in crash rates. There's a copy of the paper in Scribd as pdf. Every reference I've been able to find appears to refer to this one study. The incidence rate, including all recorded bicycle accidents with personal injury to the participating cyclist, is 19% lower for cyclists with permanent running lights mounted; indicating that the permanent bicycle running light significantly improves traffic safety for cyclists Wikipedia has a few articles, starting with daytime running lights (reports largely positive results) and bicycle lighting which gives a link in Danish that appears to refer to the Odense study above but claims 32% reduction. Daytime running lights improve cyclist safety significantly A large-scale experiments with daytime running lights on bicycles among 4,000 cyclists in Odense shows 32% reduction in cyclist accidents. The result is so striking that Councilman Wikipedia Daytime Running Lights links to Google books copy of OECD, International Transport Forum (2013), Cycling, Health and Safety, but I can't copy'n'paste out of it so here's an image:  A BicycleForums anecdote resulted in a largely positive discussion, and there's this rant that concludes they're essential. The Australasian College of Road Safety amongst others is strongly support of them for motor vehicles so it's fair to assume bicycle riders would gain something from the practice. FWIW I'm convinced. I have dynamo lights on my commuter bike that I never turn off (they have standlights so they go off a few minutes after I stop moving)."
Equipping a commuter bike for a 5 mile city commute,"Any bike you like the feel of riding. Properly fit. A hybrid (flat handlebars, wide-ish road tires) bike marketed as a commuter would probably be ideal, and they often come with everything.  However, any halfway decent bike would be fine for what you described, really. If there's any risk of carpal tunnel or similar issues from your job and/or other hobbies, seriously consider a handlebar setup with multiple hand positions. (bar ends on the flat handlebars, bullhorn bars, drop bars, etc...) Unless you're particularly into bike repair, forget the on-bike pump and patch kit, carry enough cash for a bus or taxi instead.  And keep track of where the bike shops are (and establish a relationship with one or two). Most bike shops can fix a flat in a few minutes without needing to be scheduled ahead of time, and they'll probably only charge $5-$10 (plus the cost of the new tube, of course). On the other hand: a pump can be mounted to the bike and doesn't weigh much, and a patch kit's pretty small. You'd need a tire lever or two (or multitool that includes them) also.  I do carry a pump, spare tube, patch kit and multitool with tire levers, but didn't when I was first bicycle commuting.  If you're using a bicycle with for short urban trips and are able and willing to use a secondary emergency transportation option (bus, taxi), flats should be very rare.  Changing a flat only takes a few minutes, so unless you get a flat right as the bus is coming it's probably still faster to change a flat than take a bus.  And it's reasonably easy..."
Is 13 years too old for an otherwise new-condition tire?,"A 13-year-old tire may be rideable for a few years, but it wouldn't be fair to sell it as new. It just won't last as long as a new one would, and the hardened rubber will perform worse and possibly wear faster. So, not necessarily ""unfit for use"", but definitely ""unfit for sale as a new one"". But depending on storage conditions and the tire, even a few years can make a tire unusable, such as obvious hardening or visible cracks. As for the particular review linked in the question, it seems the buyer has misread the date code. The page identifies the tires as Schwalbe Marathon HS. The Schwalbe Warranty Page has this photo of their production code:  The format appears to match the one in the question, but it still leaves at least two reasonable interpretations: But, it appears that Schwalbe has changed their production code format with an extra digit in 2010 or so. Older sources, such as this recall from 2009 show a code that has only 5 digits before a letter:  Based on this, I'd say the format is Day/Month/Year and the date on the tire is 20th July 2018. It still makes the tires somewhat old to be sold as new, but not terribly so."
How should I handle a highway patrolman who stops me occasionally to give incorrect instructions about my riding duties?,"There is no one size fits all answer to this, except the first point below.  When dealing with police, or other authority figures, always behave respectfully.  Contact the people responsible for sweeping the road and ask when or if they are going to do it next. Maybe they only sweep when requested.  Find out if there's a local bike advocacy group. They would have a history of such contact and possibly have established communication channels. If they exist then talk to them.  Failing that, then get dressed in a suit or other best clothes, and drop in to the police station with your bike to talk with the duty officer, probably a Sgt. Explain what the problem is and how you've dealt with it. Also explain that you're not complaining, just would like to not get stopped regularly. Also ask if there's a specialist cycling officer to talk to. And make sure you ask why it's happening, to get the story from their side. Do not create a you-versus-them situation, because they have the power and you lose. Once the discussion is started you can show what a sensible and reasonable citizen you are and get them on your side. It's possible that a motorist or some senior member of the community has complained (not necessarily about you), or that they have received a directive from higher up. I guess the point here is don't go in expecting them to suddenly roll over. Look for common ground and understanding.   Invite the police to come for a ride with you. Of course you would take them along that stretch of road.  Good luck. "
"What does ""modulate"" mean when referring to brakes?","Brake modulation how much fine control you have to apply a range of braking power distributed over the pull of your brake levers.   No modulation is basically no braking vs wheel locking.  Having low modulation will mean it's hard to feather the brakes and you can only really lock up the pads.  Too much modulation means you will bottom out on the levers before you lock up on the wheels. Ideal modulation gives you access to the whole range of braking power desired and allows you to apply it evenly across the range of the brake lever, giving you fine control over feathering the brakes, stopping firmly, or locking the wheel.  via simkinsdesigns.com/modulation.htm"
What is a taco?,"To taco a wheel means you've bent it so badly its a write-off and cannot be salvaged through truing.  This is significantly worse than going out of true, because the rim will be creased or torn, spoke holes will be pulled through on the outside of the taco curve.    A damaged rim alone is not a taco, there has to be a folded wheel to earn the title. Examples:
 Cause Tacoing normally happens on the front wheel, and the usual cause is side-loads caused by having the wheel not facing the direction of your travel.  That is, an aggressive turn, or a poorly landed jump can all push the rim over, exceeding the wheel's lateral strength maximum limits. A Taco in progress: 

Thankfully this chap already has his full-face helmet on; going to need it in about 1/20 of a second.  Video http://www.pinkbike.com/video/91552  More info https://i.stack.imgur.com/PDa6f.jpg . Name Why is it called a Taco?  because the wheel looks vaguely like the Mexican/American taco  Other Names Potato Chip - tend to be less damaging than a taco, and can be stomped back to shape.   Buckled / Buckling - this may or may not be damaged beyond recovery.  I've heard it used for both tacoed wheels and also wheels that are slightly out of true. others?  Feel free to edit them in here. Recovery The rider is pretty likely to have suffered physical injury too - Collarbones are are particularly vulnerable because the rider has gone Over The Bars (OTB) as the bike stops. The wheel is very probably scrap.  The best fix is to replace the whole wheel (rim/spokes/hub/QR/axle/rotor) You should be able to salvage the tyre/tube, but examine closely the bead near the fold.  Stretching may stop it from seating safely on the new rim. Also check the forks closely.  Look for damage to the legs, and misalignment.  If you have problems getting the wheel out/in because the dropouts are too close OR too far apart then the fork needs servicing, or full replacement. Headsets can suffer as well due to the leverage applied, putting steering bearings under additional load.  Any doubts and you should disassemble the headset, and examine the steerer for bending, bearings for damage, and cups for dents. Frames - a classic pattern of damage on older steel bikes was a ring of rust around the top tube and the down tube, approximately 50mm/2 inches aft of the headset weld or 25mm/1 inch after the end of a lug.  However modern alloy bikes tend to be much better at resisting damage here.   Do inspect for cracks, and include a periodic crack check in your usual maintenance procedure. At best, you will be able to reuse the hub and rotor, and relate them onto a replacement rim and spokes.  Examine them very closely for damage before reuse.   Reusing spokes/nipples is a bad idea because the ones on the outside of the taco have been stressed and could be elongated.    So the minimum damage is a new rim and spokes."
What type of brakes is least subject to failure in the winter?,"I have Roller Brake (a type of hub brakes) and have never had problems in the rain, I don’t know how well they will work at -25c as the grease may go hard.  You can not use them for very long hills, as they overheat, the grease melts and they stop working.     However for normal transport type cycling they are great."
How do I lubricate my chain?,"When should I lubricate the chain? This depends a bit upon the chain lubricant that your using, how often you ride the bike, how you store the bike and what sort of weather you are riding in. As a general rule of thumb I'd think about lubricating the chain every 100km to 200km. If your chain is visibly dirty, rusty or squeaking when you ride, then you definitely need to lubricate the chain. Do I need to clean the chain first? If it is dirty, yes, otherwise no. If you are in the habit of regularly lubricating your chain, then you don't need to clean the chain each time you lubricate it. If you leave it a long time between lubrication, then its probably worth cleaning it every time. How do I apply the lubricant? Pretty much exactly as in Gary.Ray's answer. Start at a spot on the chain you can recognise (e.g. the master link), rotate the chain slowly backwards and put a drop or two on each roller until you get back to your starting link. Finally, give the chain a good few cranks around to make sure the lubricant has penetrated appropriately and wipe any excess off. If you are feeling lazy, and don't mind getting lubricant on the ground, then you can just direct a thin stream of the lubricant onto the chain as you pedal it backwards a bit. It's more wasteful of lubricant, but faster."
Upgrading straight handlebars to drop handlebars,"I did this on my previous bike, and while it was a lot of fun (and I enjoyed riding the resulting bike) it was also quite expensive, almost half the cost of the bike.  You should also be prepared to put in a fair amount of research to determine if all the parts will work together. Here's what's involved: So if you're trying to keep the costs and headaches down, look for bar end shifters and brake levers designed for MTB brakes. Is it worth it?  If you really want drop bars, enjoy working on your bike and it costs less than buying a new one, then yes.  But make sure you plan & price it out."
How do I know when to replace my bottom bracket?,"If you answered no to both questions, keep pedalling. You're still fine. It would be nice if the BB was always smooth as butter, but a little rough doesn't mean it's broken."

Discouraging motorists from stopping at an intersection when they have the right-of-way,"Two suggestions Stop further back from the intersection. This helps by not making you look to be in a hurry to cross, and that it will take you longer to take advantage of their ""help"". It has the disadvantage that you can't see the traffic as well, and cars that stop closer to the cross road can block your view.  Choose a route that doesn't have such dangers.  I think the approach you're taking is good already though. "
What characterizes a future-proof ebike drive system?,"China has developed an ecosystem of interchangeable parts.  While there is typically one proprietary interface (controllers communicating with displays), much of the interconnection is using simple analogue voltages and signals. For example, a thumb throttle might use a potentiometer emitting 0 to 5V DC voltage to indicate how strongly it is pressed, rather than a digital communication protocol.  This can easily be replaced with another thumb throttle from a different manufacturer that uses the same principle. Typically the interfaces might be: Here's a picture from a listing for the KT controller:
 With the exception of the display and the 3-phase motor, every signal there is a DC voltage. Many Chinese ebikes use this ecosystem.  You are free to change out parts as you wish, the main thing is that you change out the controller and display together since that's the only proprietary communication protocol.  Typically there are several kinds of displays available for a controller, from simple to fancy.  More basic controllers don't have a display and just use DC signalling to the peripherals. Parts can be found from Chinese sources such as eBay, Aliexpress or importers such as PSWPower.  Some examples of manufacturers are: but other brands and no-brands can be found on Aliexpress."
"Passing cars on the right, and later merging into their lane","Seems to me that your best option is choice 2: Signal to the left in advance of running out of the lane, check for a reasonable gap in the cars while still moving, and merge into that gap once you've determined that it's safe. In that option you are essentially behaving like exactly what you are - a slow moving vehicle.  Your behavior is like what you would expect if you were operating a tractor, or a horse-drawn carriage.  You operate in the lane when neccessary, move over to the right to allow others to pass when safe and convenient, and carefully merge back into the traffic lane when the shoulder is no longer safe. While doing this you want to avoid weaving in and out of traffic every few feet. This is also similar and predictable behavior much like what you need to do when the shoulder runs out as a right-turn only lane blocks your path. Option 1 is unsatisfactory because you lose momentum and will have a difficult time merging. Option 3 is a poor choice, not from the issue of passing cars on the right (which while legal in many areas, is dangerous), but because it's rude and then forces cars to pass you later - playing leapfrog. Option 4 is a possibility, but then again, think about operating a 'slow moving vehicle.'  If you are consistently the same speed as motorists, you may stay in the lane, particularly if the shoulder is unsafe, otherwise, move over and let them pass. Option 5 is the poorest choice.  You may be able to cross against the light safely, but not only is it risky, it makes you a poor ambassador of cycling, causing motorists to be angry at other cyclist, and frequently puts you back in the leapfrog situation.  Plus, you could get a ticket, at least in my town."
How often should I refresh the sealant in tubeless tires?,"At minimum, you should replace the sealant every 6 months or so.  As you have found, a good tubeless setup will stay inflated well beyond that time, as the latex in the sealant has already sealed any small holes.  However, the sealant does dry over time, so the systems ability to self-repair when you run over a thorn or sharp rock is greatly reduced. There is no need to clean and remove the old sealant.  However, some brands tend to leave clumps that you can pick out. If you're valve cores are removable, the easiest way to add sealant is through the valve.  Otherwise, you'll have to break the tire bead off the rim (just a small section) to add sealant.  This can sometimes take a few tries to get sealed again (helpful to have a compressor or large CO2 cartridge to ""slam"" the tire into the rim)."
How much motor do I need for my electric-assist bike?,"A highly trained competitive cyclist can ride at ~ 350-400 watts of power output for a 2 hour ride.  So adding a 400 watt electric assist motor is roughly equivalent to adding a competitive cyclist 'stoker' to your rig.  The speed and battery size make a big difference but here are some rules of thumb: Some motors are measured in horsepower, rather than watts.  1/2 horsepower is roughly equal to 400 watts for this use. A 400-watt motor will usually be sufficient for the average rider. Your rig is a little heavier, so you might want to go with higher watts. On a typical 400 watt rig, two 12-volt, 12 amp-hour batteries will take an average rider 10 miles at 15 mph or up a hill that's 800 feet tall. To go faster (assuming you haven't maxed out the watts) or further, you need to increase the battery - range is proportional, so twice the battery size = twice the range at the same speed. There are companies like Convergence Tech that sell kits for motors in the 1 horsepower range that are pretty easy to add to an existing bike if you are mechanically inclined.  That range is probably more than sufficient for your needs. Be aware that some areas limit the top speed or the available power for electric or gas-assisted bicycles.  I've seen speed limits of 25-30 mph and power limits as low as 500 watts.  You will want to check with your local road or transportation department to make sure you comply with local regulations."
How to wash a bike properly? [duplicate],Cycling Tips has some useful pointers. To summarize:
Would a military helmet make a safe alternative to a bicycle helmet?,"Bicycle helmets contain crushable foam that works to extend the duration of impact by about 6 ms (milliseconds).   This doesn't make the impact force disappear, instead it extends the duration of force experienced by the brain.  By extending the duration, you reduce the peak force.  The brain can withstand impacts to some degree, however if the impact is too forceful over too short a period of time (like your head hitting asphalt), the peak force experienced by your brain becomes too high resulting in brain damage or even death.  While 6 ms may seem  small, it can be enough to reduce the peak force experience from lethal and/or damaging to survivable and/or reduced damage (see Figure 1). A)  B)  
Figure 1.  Impact force by time a brain sees with a helmet (A) and without a helmet (B).  The total energy is the same (area under the curve), but the peak force is lower for the brain with a helmet. (Source: http://www.bhsi.org/) Modern military helmet are designed to protect against things like shrapnel, not absorb impacts (although newer research may change that).  As a result your peak impact force in a crash will not substantially change and you will be under a similar risk for brain injury as being helmet less. Also you mentioned having to replace bike helmets that take an impact as a downside. If you wonder why bicycle helmets are not made with foam that ""bounces back"" (e.g. hockey helmets) this is because it can cause more damage in an impact.  With this type of foam your brain receives force in the initial hit and then it experiences a secondary ""hit"" as the foam returns (often these non-crushable foams return rapidly).  Crushable foam however does not rebound as it remains crushed. The downside is that once it is crushed it no longer provides any protective benefit and needs to be replaced. By extension when the crushable foam degrades it also needs to be replaced.  This is why it is also suggested that old bicycle helmets also need to be replaced (what constitutes old is up for debate).  In this case the crushable foam has degraded over time and its impact absorption properties change for the worse and will not provide the same benefit in an impact as a newer helmet with foam that has not degraded. Finally, I do remember hearing about a new type of foam that behaves similar to the crushable foam used in helmets, but rebounds slowly.  I will have to work to find that reference. But if they are in the marketplace they will be more robust to hits and repeat impacts."
At what point does a road become too busy/fast to ride on safely?,"Determining an acceptable risk level is really a subjective personal assessment, no one can tell you whether or not something is of an acceptable level of risk.  As such I will give you my judgement criteria for riding on roads shared with automobiles. I also ride away from traffic whenever I can so I tend to mix in a lot of dirt and asphalt.  For very quiet rural roads with low speed limits I am happy to forgo criteria (1) because there are fewer interactions with vehicles and you tend to stick out like a sore thumb in that scenario. But I also mitigate this further by only using these roads in good weather conditions (e.g., not at night in the rain). In terms of line of clear sight I feel this only provides some safety as it still requires drivers to scan ahead and recognize objects.  Many do a poor job of this, or the search images they are looking for do not include cyclists so they can miss an utterly obvious rider at the side of the road.  This is why I put line of sight last. From my criteria I don't think you need a critical assessment of your photo.  I would suggest looking at alternate routes (perhaps ones that are less direct) or look on sources such as Open Street Maps, as they have a good cycling path maps including off-road/dirt paths  that can be used to tie together routes so that busy and dangerous roads can be circumvented.  At least where I live, this has been a good strategy."
Why do racers follow the leader in a curve rather than take the shortest path?,"I have trouble imagining that the benefit of drafting is so high it outweighs the advantage of cutting it short and continuing straight. Believe it.  Drafting can reduce the power needed to maintain speed by close to 50%, so there is considerable reason to continue drafting even if the lead rider takes a circuitous course. Note also that the image you posted is foreshortened from being taken from far away with a telephoto lens.  That 5m or so difference in placement from right-to-left-and-back on that road probably takes place over more than hundred meters, if not longer."
Does the plastic cap on a Presta valve serve any purpose once fitted to a rim?,"The cap keeps dirt and rocks away from the valve, particularly the fragile release mechanism. It's not the end of the world if the caps are missing, but I suggest leaving them on. They don't take that long to remove and replace. "
How do you distinguish a touring bike from a speed/road bike?,"Any bike can be used for touring long distances. The main question is, what type of touring do you want to do?  If you want to do self-supported touring (you carry the luggage yourself on the bike vs. a car transports the stuff for the whole group), you need a bike that can take luggage. The other main feature I look for in a touring bike is comfort, because I spend a lot of time on the bike, 3-5 hours a day, day after day. Most mountainbikes, citybikes, trekking bikes, comfort bikes can be retrofitted with racks/carriers to hold panniers. Usually the rear-carrier is easy to do, the front carrier might be tricky, but there are front carriers even for suspension forks (see Old Man Mountain front racks). CHAINSTAY
For me, the most important feature of a specifically long-distance touring bike is the frame geometry. And in frame geometry, for me in a touring bike, the most important is the chainstay. A long-distance touring bike has a minimum of 45 cm chainstay (vs. 40-41 cm), but touring specific manufactures do longer ones (Rose bikes: 46 cm, IDworx: 47.1 cm). This is to give space for rear panniers, and usually the same for all frame sizes. If your feet hit the rear panniers, you cannot go. I had this problem, and it really is a problem, and difficult to fix. After checking some bikes, you will be able to tell visually how long the chainstay is (big distance between rear wheels and seatpost). To be very precise, you can measure the actual chainstay (the horizontal distance).  WHEELBASE Another helpful feature is a long wheelbase, which is size dependent, but usually 105 cm and up. This is helpful for the slower, in line motion of touring (vs. fast turning in a group of bikes in a competition). The rest, you can upgrade, or live with. My wife and I, we tour a lot. She has a 7 speed (hub gear) city bike with a rubbish rear roller brake (not to confuse with a disk brake). I have a 8 speed (hub gear) city bike-mountain bike hybrid. We bought some panniers, and there we go. On steep hills, we get off and push the bikes. I did 3000 km in the last year, and we've just been in Slovenia on a few hundred KM tour, last year we've been at the Dolomiti in Italy. We complained a lot about the 7 and 8 gears, but it didn't stop us from touring. Some myths that I think you should NOT consider: By my experience, the most helpful thing about the bike on a bike tour are puncture proof tyres, because it saves a lot of time for relatively smaller investment. Schwalbe Marathon tyres are like that. Any bike you buy for touring, I recommend to change the tyres to Schwalbe Marathon (or any other Schwalbe that is puncture proof), this will save you a lot of time when on a trip.
I suggest to buy the widest tyres your bike can take, for added comfort. In summary: my recommendation is You want to read more on here: Touring bike manufactures, grouped by country: Cycling About What to look for in a touring bike frame: Cycling About "
Does spin class prepare you for a long bike ride?,"Regular aerobic exercise is definitely of value for preparing for a big ride. Spin is a good preparation in conjunction with some outdoor rides, but it is not a substitute for riding your bike on the road.  The feel of the bike, the balance, the momentum, and the environmental and traffic factors will have an effect on your fitness as well, some of which may be purely mental. If time is limited, try spin 2-3 days a week, and build up your endurance, but also do at least one longer outdoor ride each week. If you're riding 50 miles, you need to plan to be on the bike for 3-5 hours when you do the actual ride.  Build up to where you can handle 3 hours on the bike easily, and you'll do fine. "
What are some alternatives to fruitlessly ringing my bell at a motorist?,"I'd go for the air-horn, for example the AirZound. It is my opinion that screaming and yelling (the primal scream) can cause a lot of unnecessary social distress, and is not a good alterntive for traffic communication and signalling under normal conditions. It ends up being more effective when you're in ""panic"" as said, which is barely a day-by-day acceptable situation to be. Air horns, on the other hand, save your throat, are MUCH louder, and have a more emotionaly neutral sound, adequate for signaling in traffic, specially heavy urban traffic. One single thing is paramount, based in my experience with bell-rings: the activation lever must be easily, instantly accessible by your thumb when the hand is in braking position. If you have to move or reposition your hand in order to activate the horn, it will be underused and practically uneffective. Hope this helps!"
Right hook accident scenario: who is at fault?,"You will likely be found at fault. Bicycle lanes are considered a lane of traffic that supports only one type of traffic for extended periods of time (i.e., bicycles). As such, by your description you signaled your intent, then turned right across another lane of traffic and collided with another vehicle  already occupying that lane. It is your job to ensure a lane of traffic is clear before entering it. If you were talking about two car lanes I think there would little if any questions regarding fault, but because we are talking about cycling many motorists assume it is the job of the cyclist to get out of the way because they are more vulnerable. While true from a practical perspective, this perspective is not supported legally.  Further confusing matters, in some areas  (e.g., North America) drivers are required to merge over into the bike lane (when safe) before turning, while other areas of the world do not allow any merging and instead give the cyclists the full priority at all times. Regardless, both approaches would find legal fault with the motorist turning across another vehicle lane (i.e., the cycling lane) when it was not clear to do so. Generally in most North American jurisdictions if the bicycle lane is clear you should first merge over into that lane before making a right turn (see diagram below). This merge area is often indicated with dashed lines separating the car and bicycle lanes. If you safely merge over, then you have physical position over the cyclist and they should wait until you complete your turn before passing if they wish to remain in the bicycle lane, otherwise they will need to change lane into the main traffic lane to the left to pass (assuming of course a jurisdiction that drives on the right). While you had your signal on you were still in the lane to the left of the cycling lane (i.e., left of another vehicle lane) and as such you had only signaled your intent. Until you safely enter the cycling lane, to complete your right turn, it is expectant upon you to check for traffic before moving to the right. 
From San Fransisco Bicycle Coalition I chose the figure above because it clearly communicated the concept. Some might be concerned that this only applies to San Francisco, but similar rules apply in many other North American regions. Some further examples are given below: 
  Diagram 2-12 Bike lanes are reserved for cyclists. They are typically marked by a solid white line. Sometimes you will need to enter or cross a bike lane to turn right at a corner or driveway. (See Diagram 2-12) Take extra care when you do this. Enter the bike lane only after ensuring that you can do so safely, and then make the turn. -The Official Ministry of Transportation (MTO) Driver's Handbook Where there is a broken line marking the cycle lane at the approach to the intersection the driver may move over to the curb into the cycle lane prior to making the right turn in the way that most people are used to. Drivers doing so are making a lane change and must yield to cycle traffic in the bicycle lane before moving over! In this situation, the cyclist must wait behind the vehicle until after the turn is made to clear the cycle lane. -DriveSmart BC  21717.Whenever it is necessary for the driver of a motor vehicle to cross a bicycle lane that is adjacent to his lane of travel to make a turn, the driver shall drive the motor vehicle into the bicycle lane prior to making the turn and shall make the turn pursuant to Section 22100. California Law European jurisdictions give bicycle lanes legal vehicle status, but what seems less clear is if there is support for motor vehicles merging across bicycle lanes before a right turn (if driving on the right). From the comments it appears most European nations give cyclists the absolute priority (i.e., the driver needs to wait until there is no cycling lane traffic before turning).  Explicit examples are still needed. In Germany, you would be at fault (probably fully). If you make a turn (no matter whether right or left), the traffic behind you in other lanes has priority, and you must make sure you do not obstruct or endanger it before turning. This is based on §9 Straßenverkehrsordnung (German traffic code): Abbiegen, Wenden und Rückwärtsfahren [...] 
  Vor dem Einordnen und nochmals vor dem Abbiegen ist auf den
  nachfolgenden Verkehr zu achten; vor dem Abbiegen ist es dann nicht
  nötig, wenn eine Gefährdung nachfolgenden Verkehrs ausgeschlossen ist. Translation (mine, no guarantees): Turning and reversing [...] Before changing lanes and again before turning,
  drivers must look out for following traffic; this is not necessary before turning
  if a danger to following traffic is not possible. In New Zealand cyclists appear to have absolute priority as turning motorists are not allowed to merge across the bike lane to make a turn and are required to wait until the bike lane is clear: When there’s a cycle lane at a set of lights, you must not wait in it for the light to turn green, and you must not drive in it as you approach the lights (unless you’re riding a bicycle). Motorbikes must not use this lane, either, but they can filter between stationary traffic. Cycles have the right-of-way in this lane. If there are cycles waiting to go forward, you must give way to them before you can turn left.

Pedaling at different gear ratios on flat terrain: what's the point?,"First, different people have different optimum cadence.  So that's one thing that explains different cadence between different cyclists. Second, to travel at any given speed requires a certain amount of power.  You can get more power by pushing harder at the same cadence, or you can pedal faster at the same level of force (or you can pedal harder and faster..).   Ever lift weights?  Pick a weight you can do ten times, but no more.  You can't lift ten times that much once, can you?  You get much better endurance at lower levels of force.  It's the same with pedaling a bicycle - for a given power level, most cyclists get better endurance by pedaling faster at lower levels of force, at least up to a point where your muscles start getting less efficient because they can't contract fast enough.  There's actually a good bit of research on this, and there are physiological reasons why it's true. But in general, if you want to go fast for a long period of time, it's better to pedal easy and fast than it is to pedal hard and slow. It's tough to get used to at first, but after a while it will feel a lot more natural.  Just get something that measures cadence and you can start working on riding at higher cadences."
Random piece of plastic,"This appears to be a disc brake spacer (block). Such a spacer may be inserted in the disc brake caliper between the brake pads. When the wheels are removed, and hence the brake rotor, an inadvertent pull on the brake lever might move the pistons* so that the rotor cannot be inserted any more. It is even conceivable that the pistons might be dislodged entirely – with rather messy consequences. A spacer block inserted in the caliper prevents such mishaps. Swifty pointed out in the comments the blocks need to be scrupulously clean lest brake pads get contaminated with oils transferred during insertion. *In a hydraulic disc brake the brake pads are pushed from either side into the rotor by hydraulic pistons. After releasing the levers the pistons do not move back entirely. This is due to a mechanism that automatically compensated for pads and rotor getting thinner from wear."
How should a bicycle helmet fit?,"This image has kicked around the net for a while - IDK what the original source was:  Otherwise, I second the guidance and link provided by @fady."
Putting pin(s) back into chain,"It's safer and way easier just to buy another MissingLink (KMC's name for their master link design) of the same type (pin length) the chain came with, leaving you with an inner link that has one on either end. They're around $2US. In addition to saving the trouble of getting the pin back in there, there's also the question of the integrity of modern outer chain links once they've had a pin pushed back through, even in the more normal circumstance of pushing a link halfway out for chain removal. Every current major manufacturer of derailer chains except KMC says not to do this, due to the risk of the fit not being as tight after re-insertion as it's supposed to be. I've long wondered whether there's actually anything different about KMC in this regard, but I know that modern chains in general are prone to breaking, usually during hard or fumbled front shifts, when they've been reconnected the ""traditional"" way. I wouldn't venture to guess what the odds are of it happening, probably quite low, but putting in another MissingLink eliminates the risk. They're very trouble-free. Having a couple close together may seem goofy but doesn't cause any issues in practice."
How can I interpret the intent of and respond to cars behind me honking?,"Broadly, not a lot. Legally it's probably technically unlawful on several grounds (horn not used as a warning device, causing alarm, loud noise, possibly harassment), but they're all petty offences and unlikely to get a useful response from Police. If it happens in front of a cop they might pull the motorist over for a chat, but that's unlikely. My answer to ""Is there a polite way to take the centre of the road without antagonizing motorists?"" might be helpful as it has links and some anecdata. In my experience, no. The problem is that however polite you try to be you're taking the lane so you're in their way. My suggestion is that you clearly take the lane (being assertive makes harassment less likely) and use daylight-bright rear lights. The lights are fairly affordable (see Nathan's bike light database) and I find they do help. Going faster will help, if you can match the speed of the other traffic. Since most cyclists can't do that, going faster just makes your life less pleasant. And slightly more dangerous, because ""the faster you go, the bigger the mess"" (NZ and Ireland anti-speeding campaigns, both feature graphic images). And to address gender since it seems important to some people: the evidence is mixed between ""no affect"" (Queensland, Oz) and ""women get treated better"" (the UK Walker study). Here're some typical quotes: Of 1830 respondents, 76% of men and 72% of women reported harassment in the previous 12 months.  (Queensland) {overtaking drivers pass closer to cyclists} when the rider wears a helmet, rides away from the edge of the road, is male, or when the vehicle concerned is a bus or heavy goods vehicle.  (UK) One thing to remember is that the differences Walker found were small - 1.35m vs 1.40m passing distance. There are other studies, once you're past the first page of this google search it gets interesting. This report cites references when talking about passing distances and how far from the curb you should ride, and talks to police and cycling advocates: As cyclists we should be confident in taking up as much of the lane as we feel we need to in order to be safe. At a minimum we should ride 50cm from the curb but we should be confident in using more of the lane if the conditions dictate it — as a result of roadside obstacles, upcoming intersections, narrow lanes, potholes or any other factors."
"Evidence on ""Uglify Your Bike: Effective Theft Deterrent?""","It is effective against certain kinds of bike theft, particularly if you already lock up your bike effectively every single time (which is a good assumption if you're willing to go through the trouble to uglify it).   Many people swear by it.  For example, LDS missionaries in Taiwan repaint their new bikes poorly as a matter of tradition. As Daniel already pointed out, there are several kinds of bike thieves. The US Deparment of Justice COPS report on bike theft in 2008 lists the following kinds of bike thieves: To the first and second kind of thief, appearance is only a minor concern.  To the third appearance is a major concern.  The amount of each type of thief really depends on the area.  In some areas very few are joyriders, whereas, in other areas mentioned in the report, up to 80% of the reported stolen bikes were abandoned and later recovered.  Your risk for each type of thief also depends on where, when, and how you lock up your bike. As these interviews with bike thieves point out, most bike theft of the first two kinds happens primarily because the bike is inadequately locked, not because of appearance, although appearance may deter these thieves regardless. Thieves often sell stolen bikes for dirt cheap, down to $100 or less, so to them it doesn't matter much if it looks like a beater bike or a racing bike. For example, my brother had his $80 old Walmart bike stolen when he left it in an apartment bike rack overnight with just a cable lock. The interviews even mention that bikes over $1000 are sometimes too risky for low-level thieves to steal.
All of this may explain why this study found that cheap bikes, including used cheap bikes, are among the most frequently stolen (see the picture below). The study also found that used bikes under $150 dollars are stolen many times more frequently than new bikes in the same price range.  However, this raw data has some complexities, like how cheap old bikes are several times more popular than new, expensive ones and how expensive-bike-owners are usually more thorough in their locking practices.  That being said, there is a difference between making a bike look worthless and making a bike look repulsive.  Stickers and rust are repulsive, while a bad paint job and a milk crate on back are just cheap.  Making your bike look unsellable at any price should be your goal, not to make it look like a cheap beater. Somewhere like New York with more of the third kind of thefts, planned thefts by seasoned thieves, is going to be an area where appearance matters far more and how you lock it matters much less.  The interviews with thieves that I mentioned earlier shows how professional thieves will be ordered to steal an expensive bike or a certain brand of bike, or will see one and case it, coming back at an opportune moment with power tools or whatever it takes.  Against these kinds of theft, changing appearance is one of the only methods of prevention."

Is it better to get an entry-level carbon bike or a similarly priced aluminum bike?,"Essentially this is about low end carbon versus high end alloy. Carbon is typically lighter and less harsh (more vibration absorption) than alloy, but is not as robust. I doubt that the alloy is much heavier. I think it will come down to the difference in component quality and your budget. Personally for a training bike I would probably go for the alloy, but that is driven by my financial situation. If the bikes are of similar price and the components are of the same quality, I would consider the carbon.  However I would not trade component quality for a carbon frame. Edit : Seven years after the answer was give.
Many of the techniques learn laying up carbon, and with advances in hydroforming alloy, have lead to allow alloy frames that are significantly cheaper to fabricate yet nearly as light (if not lighter) than low end carbon frames, while having the characteristics of stiffness and compliance where wanted. You can no longer discuss 'Carbon' and 'Non-Carbon' frames as most major manufacturers have 2, 3 or more variations of carbon from 'cheap and cheerful' to 'insanely light and expensive'. The cost saving in Alloy frames put into better components leads to a better bike for the same build cost. As carbon is considered more desirable by many, it fetches a higher price for the bike. TL;DR when buying a bike, look at the whole bike, not just the frame."
What are the benefits of drop bars?,"The main advantage is more hand positions. With a regular flat bar, you hold your hands at the grips (with possibly about one more hand position available if you have bar ends). With drop bars, you can hold at: For long rides, this makes a difference due to hand fatigue.  A secondary advantage is you can also change how aerodynamic you are and your body geometry with respect to the bike by shifting around and using different hand positions relatively easily. For example, when you're in the drops, you're in a more aerodynamic shape versus sitting straight up with your hands on the tops.  Drop bars aren't for everyone and do require proper setup (as do all bikes) and acknowledgement of the geometry of the bike. In particular, racers will likely set their bike up differently than tourers will (e.g. higher bars than racers), where its primarily a comfort thing. If you like doing long rides with flat bars and bar ends, more power to you. But for most people, the same bike won't work well with drop bars and flat bars because changing the bar changes the riding geometry. "
Lessons from downhill crash,"To ride in the dark is difficult.  You should have a decent head light on your helmet so it tracks your vision, and a handlebar light that tracks where your front wheel is aiming.   In addition you should have a secondary front light and two back lights for redundancy.  We don't make product recommendations here, but that would be the minimum. To increase your awareness, consider riding UP the track that you plan on coming down later.  This way you'll be moving much slower and have a better chance of spotting obstructions before you come through. Also consider not doing crazy speeds on downhills.  The road rules say ""Don't outdrive your lights"" so you should be able to stop in the distance illuminated.   Perhaps you should leave the downhill leg until the sun is higher ? Braking technique - if you were doing a hard brake on a turn, and your front wheel slid out from under you then its all over, you're going down.  Some more tread on your front tyre may have helped, as would lower pressure in the front tube.  Another technique, you could overweight the front wheel to make the side lugs dig in and regain grip, or you could unweight the front wheel and try to stop it pushing, and therefore regain grip.   All this has to happen really quickly, we don't generally react fast enough. Clothes - your outerwear did its job, and took all/most of the sliding damage.  I suggest you slap some patches on the damaged bits, and on the knees, and call it your Riding Gear.   No point dressing up all pretty for a ride (unless you're into that sort of thing)   My favourite riding pants have canvas on the knees, over a patch of woollen blanket, and some light cotton on the inside of the knee,  They're butt-ugly but totally comfortable.   Finally experience - you've just acquired some.  Sadly it was painful. You should also give your bike a close look and service.  Standard crash damage to look for includes: Wheels out of true, rim damage, broken spokes and loosened nipples. Disk Brake rotors no longer flat, or rim brake pads slightly out of position Gears out of whack - bent derailleuruer hanger is very common. Mudguards/fenders out of position, or plastic bits cracked. Also give the bike a service and lube, and look for damage while doing it."
Optimal Maintenance Schedule,"Daily: check the tyres and chain. If you need air or lube, apply them. This really falls under the ""when riding, be aware of your bike"". Rather than thumb-test my tyres I look at the bulge in the sidewall when I'm riding. Weekly: pump the tyres, lube the chain. Regardless of whether they ""need it"", I'll put the pump on and check the pressure, then use a bit of lube on the chain. Swap rechargeable batteries in my bike lights (LED lights use so little current that it's easy to overdischarge batteries, and weekly is about as long as I can space this before I forget. Otherwise I think ""did I do this last week? Probably""). Also pick the broken glass out of your tyres. An old spoke, sharpened at one end and bent into a handle at the other works well for this. Monthly: fix the niggling things that aren't really faults that stop the bike working, so I never actually fix them. Lube and adjust the gear cables, adjust the brakes, tighten the mudguard bolts, repair or replace the loose reflective tape. Check brake pads for wear etc. six months/seasonally: make sure the lights are all there and working. Check and lube the shifter on my Rohloff. Check girlfriend's bike and fix anything she hasn't bothered to. On derailleur bike (ick!) check chain wear. Check for frayed gear/brake cables. annually: change Rohloff oil. There's a whole heap of other stuff that I do when necessary, like putting new tyres on. If I get a puncture on a Marathon Plus I generally replace it, because that only seems to happen when they're quite worn. Lesser tyres I check whan I'm fixing the puncture (since I have to inspect the whole tyre to find the puncturing thing anyway). If shifting gets hard or braking reels funny I check the cables, since a fraying cable is often the cause of those problems. And so on. Edit: what would a bike shop do in their checkup? The main thing is that they are not you so there's a second set of eyes, and partly they have no interest in ""oh, that's not right but it's a pain to fix so I'll just live with it"". So the mechanic will start with the obvious stuff I listed in my ""evaluate a second hand bike"" answer. The mechanic will be test riding the bike, so they want to be sure it's safe to do that. And anything that needs fixing, they will note down and either fix or ring you and ask if you want to spend the money. It's probably easier to present as a checklist of functions. For each item mentioned there's an implicit ""is it there, attached securely, in working order"" check as well. This is all done in a proper work stand, with good lighting. Most of the tools are the ones you'll find on a compact multitool (but they're good quality separates). All cable replacements mean replacing the outers as well, and fitting end caps etc. frame and fork. Check the bearings in the headset for slop and the grinding feeling of dirty or overtight bearings (crash damage sometimes comes through there when the bearing races have been pushed out of alignment or the frame is ovalised where it's supposed to hold the bearing race). Look for dents, holes or other frame damage. If in doubt pull out the frame alignment checking tools and go wild. wheels. Spin them checking for bearing play and broken/loose spokes. Look for rim wobble too. True wheels if necessary in a proper wheel truing stand (they have to be true so we can set rim brakes later, and they're expensive to replace if they're wrecked which means sometimes the whole job stops here). Check rim and tyre wear and tyre inflation. If the valve is at a funny angle let the air out, straighten it and reinflate. Inflate tyres to marked pressure so later we can check for slow leaks. saddle. Tight and in usable condition. handlebars. Lots of stuff happens here, but for now just twist against the wheel to make sure the headset and handlebar clamp bolts are tight. crankset/bb. Spin the pedals by hand and feel for slop/grinding. Check pedal bearings too. Eyeball frame clearance (is the BB the right length, are the cranks bent?) gears. Change through all gears. Check shifters and cables. brakes. All that gear testing means using the brakes. But now: squeeze each brake lever to the handlebars. This should take considerable force. Adjust the brakes so it does, the recheck. New pads and cables if there's any doubt (you'd be surprised how many cables snap at step one). Fine adjust brakes to just barely clear the braking surface. New disk rotor at this point if it's too bent. mudguards/fenders, racks, lights, soft toys and other accessories. Make sure snything else on the bike is at least properly attached. check the tyre pressure. It should still be whatever you inflated them to at the start. If this is your bike the check is unneccessary because you already know there's a slow leak and you will fix it now, won't you? put the bike in the ""to be test ridden"" area for someone else to test ride (I lied above). They will check that the gears and brake work, and that the bike rides ok with no odd noises or anything. Mudguards especially can be a pain here because flimsy ones rub on the wheels at the slightest excuse. But yes, this is where you see the mechanic sprint to 30km/hr then do an emergency stop. There are specific checks for other stuff. The rubber pad on the steering arm of Long John bikes gets replaced, roller brakes get greased etc. If you're doing this at home you will probably need a spoke key to do basic wheel straightening on the bike where a mechanic will use a spoke tensiometer and truing stand. If you're going to send the wheel to a mechanic don't play with the spokes first. That just causes problems because your efforts will make the spoke tension really uneven. Fixing that takes time. You pay for the time... A new bottom braket requires a crank puller and the right tool to grip the BB. It's not worth buying these for most people. It the BB has slop just get the shop to replace it. Aside from those two most of the special tools that bike shops have make the job faster, easier and more consistent. You're never going to get ""consistent"" with one or two bikes, and it's not worth paying for tools you use once a year. This should take ~30 minutes to check and lube, plus whatever repair time is required. At $100/hour charge-out rare it's $50. If your bike is clean and in good order it'll be significantly faster (5 minutes if there's nothing to do), if you bring in a rusty old ""vintage classic"" bike from the tip it could take days."
Does this chainring need to be replaced?,"Judging by Sheldon's Guide, it definitely looks like you are in need of a new chainring.  Your middle and larger sprockets in particular look like they have taken on a significant ramp-like profile, which will surely lead to lackluster shifting."
How does one carry multiple bike bags once off the bike?,"There's no magical solution: if you want to take to be able to take everything out of the bike, the solution is to choose bags that can be easily removed and to have as few bags as possible. Or to ride with other persons, and leave someone to look after the bikes when you are doing errands. In a bikepacking context, the ""friend option"" is probably the only one, as packing is an art, and it would be real hassle to mount/unmount everything. In a ""utility biking purpose"" (or actually most non-offroad situations with moderate loads), you can easily compromise on weight distribution and have everything in one bag, and racks are a must in that context. It's possible to find bags that can be easily removed and mounted for racks. Some prefer a handlebar bag, but for smaller capacities, personally I like the ones that seat on top of the rack: there are models that offer quite a good flexibility like the Topeak MTX TRUNKBAG DXP (the rail mounted version, not strap mounted, important for the convenience when removing the bag) - not an endorsement, but there are not so many equivalents of this bag. But if the bags you mention only contains small items, another solution is to have everything in a backpack or a hip bag. For leisure rides, I'm personally using a 6-litres hip bag, as I don't like backpacks. It can contains everything I need for rides up to 4-5 hours. EDIT: Bottles are a different issues, as indicated by Criggie's comment, that can be an issue to leave them on the bike. In some contexts, it's however OK to leave them on the bike (I would say more in the countryside than in cities)."
Do I have to simply wait for google maps to add cycling directions to my area? Or can I help?,"Have a look at http://www.opencyclemap.org/ it uses the http://www.openstreetmap.org/ data, so you can help them by mapping your local cycle ways."
How does Google Maps estimate cycling times,"The answer given by gammapoint is surely a nice estimate to take into account when looking at Google Maps. However, as being rather close to Google through Top Contributor and Local Guides programmes (although not being an employee), I can almost surely tell: We'll never know. Unless, of course, you get yourself hired in that specific department in Google. The algorithms used by Google to estimate cycling time are based on many factors. Supposedly some of the are (the list below is nothing official, so no sources): All answers on the internet will be based on estimates on specific direction queries and will try to obtain some results from comparing different or similar routes. Yet, using even bigger data to estimate behaviour of complex algorithms is difficult to the point I'll say impossible. Provided Google is using neural networks or possibly even more sophisticated algorithms, such analysis is pointless. I'm sorry, but to find out your speed compared to Google estimates, you need to run the tests by yourself."
How do I stop my rim brakes making a squeaking/squealing sound?,"V-brakes can be hateful and make a lot of sound if they're improperly adjusted- sometimes they're noisy even when they're properly adjusted, especially on braking surfaces that are not machined. You can usually alleviate this with one or more of the following methods. First and foremost, make sure your pads are properly adjusted. This is better demonstrated than described, so check out this youtube video to save yourself a lot of reading. If the link goes down, just google v-brake adjustment. Make sure the braking surface of the rim is clean. Use rubbing alcohol and a green scrub pad to scrub off any crud, and then wipe the braking surface off with a clean towel with a dab of alcohol on it. Using anything besides rubbing alcohol may leave a residue and make the problem worse. Toe in the brakes. I found this image which not only illustrates what ""toeing in"" your brakes is, but shows a nifty little trick to set the gap appropriately:   You may need to toe them in more that what this picture is showing if they continue to squeal on you."
Patch or replace tube?,"I generally carry 2-3 spare tubes and (back when I used to get flats, before Kevlar tires) I would swap out the tube, then repair the punctured one later, at my leisure.  A simple puncture, on the tread side and not too close to the valve (or another patch), is no reason to discard a perfectly good tube. I prefer to use a kit about like this one: http://www.rei.com/product/747197/novara-patch-kit -- with a tube of glue and rounded, feathered edge patches.  The glue is a PITA if you try to put the tube immediately back in the tire (unless you carry talc), but when you do it later and the glue has plenty of time to dry it works fine.  (Though place a bit of tissue over the glued area before folding up the tire for re-stowage.) (But as I indicated, the real solution is Kevlar-belted tires.)"
How can I clean sand off my bike chain?,"You can use a spray bottle with diluted degreaser to spray down the chain and wipe it with an old towel to get most of the dirt off; or if it's really sandy or muddy you can use regular soap and water and a sponge. Then clean and lube the chain the way you normally would. After using several different plastic mechanical chain cleaners my favorite method is also one of the cheapest. I use a small can, like a soup or a tomato sauce can, put a little degreaser in it and clean the chain with an old toothbrush. Using the bottle is okay, but stay away from using gasoline, kerosene, paint thinner or other harsh liquids.  These will penetrate deeply into the links and will displace the lube you try to reapply, as well as creating a significant fire hazard. Some people like to use diesel fuel which is okay. In my opinion, I'd stick to a quality degreaser product."
How do I keep my seat from tilting back?,The problem is that there is only one bolt holding the seat at the angle you want.  Put enough torque on the back of the saddle and can overcome the friction that's holding the seat in place. A few options:
How do I prevent disk brakes from squeaking in the rain?,"The only way that I've found to get them to stop squeaking is to burn the water off.  Big steep hill and stop at the bottom. As for performance, I don't notice any difference in the feel of my BB7's in the wet vs. the dry after a couple seconds of use.  Even in rain puddles up to the bottom bracket."
How to minimize wear on pants,"The obvious answer would be to get some Cycling Jeans, i.e. jeans specifically designed for cycling in. These have reinforcement and stretch in the right places and often have other features such as deep pockets, a loop to carry a small lock and reflective strips. Levi, Rapha, Muxu and Swrve all make cycling jeans, so there's a fair amount of choice."
Spokes keep breaking - bad hub or bad build?,"A wheel is only as strong as the tension on the spokes. If the wheel was loose for any significant length of time before you noticed it, the spokes will fatigue very quickly, because they are flexing through a range of motion which is not intended.  You are a big guy at 95 Kg, so this type of problem is not unusual (as am I). That means that you need to be especially wary of loose spokes and rapid detensioning of your wheels. Most ""system"" wheels have an 85-100 Kg bike and rider weight limit. It would be difficult to conclude that it is the the sole responsibility of the shop.  However, this is a recognized problem, and one your shop should have discussed with you prior to rebuilding the wheels. In addition, they should have prepared you to check and tune the wheels with greater frequency.   A break in ""tune up"" is normal and expected on a new wheel, after about 1 months riding, but it can come much faster for a heavy rider.  If the wheel is ridden loose, the fatigue damage to the spokes can be permanent, and require rebuilding the wheels again. This is not quite the fault of the shop, but it sounds as if they did not take the care and time to explain the necessities of the new wheels, and certainly, blaming ""burrs in the spoke holes"" is not a valid excuse, as any competent mechanic must check the hub condition before using it in a new build. Spoke holes, if there were burrs (unlikely, on a wheel you rode for a year without problems) can be deburred easily.  My recommendation: discuss these things with the owner or manager of the shop (not the mechanic who did the work, unless that is the manager), and ask him to rebuild the wheels again, properly, with new spokes and rims. If he agrees, and does it, then well and good.  If not, cut your losses, and move on to a shop with a higher level of competence. "
Should or can I (car) wax my frame?,"Using car wax on your frame could certainly help protect it over time, though storing it indoors is much more important so that all of the components are protected from the weather. There are bike specific products like Pedro's Bike Lust but if you don't want to go that direction you should be just fine with any auto wax. In the past I have heard of people using furniture polish as well to give the bike that just out of the shop shine. You will want to avoid the harsher products that contain aggressive abrasives like rubbing compounds, especially if you have carbon portions of your frame, as these will remove the clear-coat and can lead to damage or failure."
Practical cleaning routine for a commuter bike,"As needed or as inspired, rinse off bike with water, clean with soapy water and degreaser, wipe down, rinse off. In practice, I do this every month or two or... of commuting. And yes, there are advantages to cleaning your bike; a clean bike will last longer, perform better, and serve as proof of the love of a proud owner. this answer focuses on cleaning the bike, but cleaning is also a good opportunity to check the bike for mechanical issues, including worn or loose parts:"
Selecting the right crank length,This is probably going to depend on a bit more than just your height or leg length (though I'm sure a rough idea can be gleaned). Your specific bike (geometry) and riding position will also affect crank length a bit. Here are a few good links on the subject that go beyond my knowledge on the issue.
Why is Shimano's 105 groupset called 105?,"This is a non-answer because I've been looking at Japanese bicycling sites and blogs and no one really knows. The closest answer is found here: 105の名の由来とは？ 最後に、各グレード名の由来についての豆知識を紹介します。1971年に誕生したデュラエースの名は、素材のジュラルミン（Duralumin）と耐久性を意味するデュラビリティ（Durability）に、世界一のコンポという願いを込めた「エース」を組み合わせた造語です。1976年に誕生のアルテグラは、Ultimate（究極）+Integrate（統合）を意味するコンポーネントです。1982年に誕生した105については、当時のダブルレバーSL-A105の型番を継承し、現在では105というグレード名になっています。 which google translate translate (with some clean-up) as: What is the origin of the 105 name? Finally, I will introduce my knowledge about the origin of each grade name [in the Shimano series]. The name of Dura Ace which was born in 1971 is a combination of Duralumin of the material and Durability meaning durability combined with ""Ace"" which wish of the world's best component. The birth of Ultegra in 1976 is a component that means Ultimate + Integrate. Concerning 105 which was born in 1982, it inherited the model number of the double lever SL-A 105 at that time and now it has become the grade name of 105. So it's a non-answer answer. The author of this article, Kenji Hashimoto, is a sports journalist in Japan and so it's about as close as one might get unless you ask Shimano."
Should I drive or bike to work? [closed],"Health Two decades ago I threw away my bike.  Admittedly it was worn, but I had that ""I have a car, why do I need a bike?"" thought. After a long time in a sedentary desk job, I got back on a bike and started the return to a healthy weight and muscle tone. Best to keep the habit of healthy exercise by doing plenty of it. 3.6 miles (5 km) is 15 minutes at a casual pace, or 10 minutes if you're making an effort. Nowadays my car does 150 miles (225 km) in one year, while I did twentyfold that on a bike."
Cycling to work - 30 mile return,"Even with an e-bike going to 150 miles a week is a big jump. Likely you just need to have a few rest days to allow your body to adapt and recover. 3 weeks is the range in where you start run into problem with long term recovery.  I'd suggest switching down to 3 days a week until you feel completely recovered every day. Also lay off the strava, going for Personal Bests (PBs) is something you should keep to a minimum in daily rides. Focus on a pace that allows you to arrive at work w/o feeling stressed at all. This will help with the leg soreness/tiredness during the day.  The saddle problem is a completely different one that every bike rider has to figure out. Some of it is just that you are spending a lot more time in the saddle, but most of it is finding the right saddle that works for you and your position on the bike. Unfortunately, there are no simple fixes. There are various saddle fitting guides out there, but nothing works for everybody and almost every saddle works for somebody. The best solution would be to find a local bike shop with a saddle demo program that will let you try different saddles until you find the one that works for you. "
Keeping my ears warm while biking in the cold with a helmet,"Try searching for the term ""ear band"". They tend to be thin enough to comfortably wear under a helmet, and the good ones are fully wind-resistant, yet breathable. If you have an open ventilation-style helmet, I recommend a helmet cover as well, which is a fabric sleeve that stretches over the top of the helmet which also significantly cuts wind passing through, and may be easier to use instead of a jacket hood (not to mention more streamlined). Install once per season. Balaklavas or ""dickies"" are also good to protect the neck and shoulders, and there are also polar fleece neck warmers that may be more comfortable and can bunch up nicely under the back of the helmet. Any quality of biking glasses/goggles are useful, too — look for ones with clear lenses — which will ensure your eyes don't get a full blast of cold directly."
What to do when a snake is in front of you?,"In the situation you describe it sounds like there is no time to stop.  The next best option has to be riding around the snake toward its tail, because snakes (like most animals, apart from humans on bike paths) mostly move forward. If you're going fast and significantly altering course would risk you falling on the ground (near the snake!), just hold your line.  If you're confident and skilled enough, you can bunnyhop to avoid injuring it. I think that's about the sum of what you have time to do in a close-quarters situation at speed.  A big part of the outcome is--for better or worse--dependent on the snake."
Why did curved forks disappear?,"The main reason is the materials used.
Basically, on all bikes with bent forks the bent forks are made of steel. Steel has been mostly replaced by carbon and aluminium. While steel is heavier, it is not prone to fatigue when bending within its fatigue limit, making it possible to use thinner tubes with more flex and allowing the bend in the fork to work like a basic shock absorber. Aluminium has no fatigue limit, thus it needs to be stiff enough or it will eventually break, making it not suitable for comfortable flexing forks. A big curved bend puts more stress on the material than a small sharp bend at the crown. Carbon has properties which are very different to metals. Carbon parts  are not just defined by the shape of the object, but also by the layup of carbon fibers, making it possible to get shock absorbing characteristics without needing a bend to work as spring, just by engineering the right layup of fibers. That's the why many aluminium bikes use carbon forks. There are other big reasons why bent forks are less common on modern bikes. You could say, why use an expensive carbon fork on your aluminium bike, if a cheap steel fork would be as comfortable? Looks! A thin tubed round bend steel fork just doesn't look right on a thick edgy carbon or aluminium frame. Also thin steel tubes aren't as aerodynamic as the optimized shapes you can make with carbon or hydroformed aluminium."
How long is the life cycle of a bicycle?,"Let's try to steer this into some kind of sensible question with the perspective as seen from a typical bicycle shop workshop and what is on the road.  In a bike workshop you can find yourself working on bikes that can be up to fifty years old with a large quantity of them being more than ten years old. Some of these bikes have not been out of the garden shed for the last five years and have suddenly came into use because the owner's son or daughter has started riding.  Therefore this question very much depends on how often the bike gets an airing, how it is stored and how much it gets maintained. For the person using their bike every day for commuting, the lifetime of the bike is an economic question. After five years or so, even with brake block changes, new cables, maybe the odd new set of sprockets, new tyres, replacement chains and plenty of t-l-c, the bike will suffer all-over wear that costs almost as much as a new bike to put right. Wheel rims will wear through, saddles will get torn,  bits of 'Shimano plastic' will go missing and the whole drive-train will get worn. Fixing these problems will typically necessitate another round of consumables, e.g. chain, cables, brake blocks and tyres. All of these are more expensive as spares that you have to put time into fixing or pay a shop to fix. Meanwhile, at OEM prices, pre-fitted to a new bike, a better deal can be found. The existing bike has 'depreciated' to become a liability much like how an old car does.  If you look at the cars people drive you will notice that there are not too many 'Ford Cortina' models on the road. (UK) There are not too many 'Ford Sierra' models on the road either. Yet, there was a time when every other car was one of these models. There are one or two of these left and you do see them once in a blue moon, so clearly it was possible to service them and keep them on the roads forever. However, that did not happen for 99.9% of these once popular Ford cars. Now have a look for what people actually ride. There is a reasonable selection of twenty year old models on the roads used by people on the commute or taking the dog for a walk. However, depending on where you live, the majority of bikes are recent, i.e. less than ten years old. Half of those are very new, less than three years old. Most of these 'daily riders' are well on their way to being used up as a 'mechanical resource'. As for your point 2), in the UK many bikes get abandoned by their riders when they take up driving. Before people get to that age they do go through a series of bikes that they grow out of. Competitive riders are different again, typically they have a fleet of bicycles and a ludicrous amount of spare parts left over from upgrades. To summarise, a bike will have a lifetime of approximately five everyday-riding years before it gets shot to pieces. This lifetime can be extended indefinitely through new components and diligent maintenance (or instantly shortened in the case of a crash). In reality people can ride bikes long after the bike is past its best, they can also put the bike into storage for long periods of time and they can also get into the sport (to purchase many bikes that don't necessarily get worn out)."
Are single chainring mountain bikes usual?,"A 1x drivetrain (single chainring) is pretty much the standard now in mountain biking - you will notice the rear cassette is much wider than the classic 3x7 setup you are used to.  The wide rear cassette gives a wide range of gears (although not always as wide as the old 3x7). Most also have also moved to more speeds(sprockets) in the rear (i.e., 11-12 speed), if the 1x9 has a large range (which it appears that it does), it will have larger steps between gears than a 3x7 drivetrain you are used to. Other changes in modern mountain bike drive trains are: Better chain retention and a single rear derailleur means that riders have to think less about gears. In the modern setup you do not have to think about chain management, as the chains generally remain in the selected gear. Contrast this against a 3x7, where you often had to remember to shift Big-big (big ring, big cassette) before downhills to improve chain retention. This leaves the rider to focus more on navigating the terrain. In terms of the pictured bike, the drawbacks relative to a 3x7 are likely a reduced range between the hardest and easiest gear and larger jumps between gears. The OP updated the question to note that the bike is intended for casual on road use.  The 1x setup is really tune  for trail usage were speeds are slower. Relative to the reference drive train (a 3x7), out of the box it will be less functional for on road use due to it being under-geared for the road (i.e., on the road you may find there is not a ""hard"" enough gear).  This can be alleviated by swapping out the front chain ring for a larger chain ring (as well as road friendly tires).  The gearing is more ""tunable"" than  reference drive train, where there were little option in the market  to change the 3x chainrings to different sizes."
6-bolt vs centre-lock: pros and cons?,"Centerlock largely exists because since the beginning of modern disc brakes for bikes, Shimano has more or less alone had a weird cautionary take on the physics of rotor bolts theoretically being able to loosen in the six-bolt design. That's why their six-bolt rotors have always come with various retention systems for the bolts that nobody else bothers with.
 Centerlock doesn't accomplish anything special and doesn't allow for lighter hubs or rotors (at least in a meaningful sense). Shimano rotors are excellent so it's not like you're trapped if you have centerlock hubs, but you do have fewer options, and centerlock rotors are inherently more expensive at the low end because they can't just be flat pieces of steel. Centerlock has the disadvantage that carrying a lockring tool plus something to turn it isn't practical, so the best you can do if you severely bend a rotor on a ride is undo the caliper mounting bolts and try to hang the caliper out of the way, which is awkward. Even though the risk here is small and theoretical, it's enough of a potential day ruiner that given centerlock has little to no functional advantage, there's an argument to avoid it if all else is equal. The catch is that all else is often not equal, because Shimano hubs are some of the best value choices. Six-bolt does have the disadvantage that bolts getting seized, heads getting stripped, and/or hub threads getting damaged are all things that happen sometimes, whereas centerlock tends to be free from any such problems. Having one big high-torque fastener does create a more reliable interface in that sense. But it's a pretty fringe concern; six-bolt is perfectly robust and very few people will ever have to deal with a seized rotor bolt. However, in all fairness it can be a difficult enough problem to deal with when it does happen that centerlock usually looks pretty good by the second hour in."
Is it possible to ride 18km everyday for a beginner?,"18km a day is not far, as long as you have an OK fitness level to start with and no health issues, it is certainly achievable, but...   You will not get any rest days. I was once told, you do not get fit exercising, you get fit recovering. If you ride 5 days a week, there's no recovery time. This could lead to problems since each day's effort is stressing your body. For the beginning I would strongly recommend not more than 3 days (with a day between) until you are sure you can comfortably do five days every week.  What I would suggest you to do is first thing in the morning measure your resting pulse rate. Do this for 3 or 4 mornings to establish a baseline. Start riding, taking it easy to begin with (for the first couple of weeks). Note how you feel and your resting pulse rate - if you feel bad and your pulse is higher than it should be, have a rest day or two. (Note - normally your resting pulse rate will fall as you get fitter, so your baseline will change.) The trick is to have an alternative to riding available so you don't need to ride if you need a rest, but not so available that you use it all the time. "
Is my stopping dangerous when Idaho Stop is de facto but not legal?,"When it comes to stop signs, I live by some simple rules: I don't necessarily clip out and put my foot down, but I stop. These rules have worked for me pretty well. But one thing I've never worried about is my safety, when I stop. I've easily ridden 100,000 miles on the roads, including the East Bay, in all kinds of conditions. I don't think I've ever been in a situation where I felt less safe stopping than not stopping. There are plenty of things out there to worry about, but that isn't one of them."
"What to throw money at when trying to level up your biking from an older, generic bicycle?","Very rarely do upgrades make enough difference to a bike to justify the cost or doing them.  For this reason, I am a strong believer that while you should maintain a bike, you are almost always better to buy a better bike than try to make an existing bike better. Upgrading worn components with better quality can be done, carefully looking closely at the cost and be realistic about the expected benefit. This applies even more to an entry level bike (such as yours) than to a more expensive bike. I would do the minimum needed to keep the bike safe and reliable while you use it and save for a replacement bike. You now have enough recent miles you can probably feel the difference between your bike and a more expensive one. I suggest heading to a bike shop and taking a couple of bikes at various price points for a ride. Get the idea of what a better bike might feel like, and if the improvement would be worth the cost to you. You have already replaced the saddle - a good investment as it can be moved to a new bike easily and the right saddle makes a big difference to any bike. Specifics on your bike - the chain and cassette should last much longer than 1000km. Are you cleaning and lubing the chain regularly?   The rest look like routine maintenance items for a bike of that quality and age (except the broken crank, which should never happen outside of major accident.)"
Why is there nearly no 1x road bikes?,"I’m going to state things a bit differently from the other answers. On performance road bikes, you want to have small steps between at least the major gears and a wide range. Going 1x with even 12 cogs in the rear means some combination of less range or bigger jumps. MTB suspension design improved tremendously when designers didn’t have to worry about the existence of the front derailleur. Road bikes don’t benefit from suspension systems. Their tires provide enough of it. Road bikes don’t gain much of any benefit from losing the front derailleur—there is a small aerodynamic gain, but part of it may be offset by higher drivetrain friction in the smaller cogs, and in the bigger cogs due to a poorer chainline (as compared to being in small ring big cogs on a 2x when climbing). It’s also considered best practice to install a chain guide to make sure the chain doesn’t fall off, which further offsets the aero gains. However, there are niches where 1x will catch on. For dedicated cyclocross bikes, a lot of people will consider 1x. Time trial bikes can clearly benefit unless the course is hilly enough. Criterium racers with a dedicated race bike might also consider 1x. Some specific road courses can call for a 1x, or some people may live in really flat areas. But these are all niches. Relatedly, if Classified’s geared hub takes off, more people would probably adopt it and run a single ring up front. However, the cost is high and the alternative (run a front derailleur) is quite effective. Therefore, I'm not sure how much take up Classified will achieve. For historical reference, Aqua Blue Sport raced 1x11 SRAM drivetrains in 2017 and 2018. Their bikes were designed only for 1x. The team folded. The causes were multifactorial, but it seems like the big gaps at the top of the cassette may have contributed by leaving riders more fatigued. Some of the issues are discussed in this blog post. More recently, some teams have started to experiment with 1x in only certain races. Lizzie Deignan won the 2021 Paris Roubaix Femmes on a 1x12 drivetrain. Primož Roglič won the uphill time trial of the 2023 Giro d'Italia on a 1x12 as well. Last, there are few 1x performance road bikes. However, a 1x drivetrain is much simpler for beginners. Experienced cyclists may scoff, but consider this: you and all your colleagues adapted to 2x, but you are not seeing the people who got turned off by 2x. It may not be the single deciding factor in a beginner leaving the sport because many failures have multifactorial causes, as above. However, it is an added stress point. I suspect many entry-level drop bar bikes will come in 1x in the future. Shimano's new CUES lineup of groups targeted at lower-end prices will be offered in 1x or 2x with 9-11 speeds. SRAM's Apex AXS and mechanical groups, which are equivalent-ish to Shimano Tiagra, are only offered in 1x."
How should I approach hills?,"I try to put out a constant amount of effort no matter what slope I'm on: The useful energy you put in is proportional to a product of the force multiplied by the cadence: spinning faster at the same force results in more energy input. To keep my cadence and force constant, I change gears: if it's spinning too easily/quickly and I'm going too slowly, then I change up into a higher/harder gear; on a hill if it's too hard to spin (at 60 to 90 RPM) then I change down into a lower gear. I'm always seated (not standing on the pedals ... except when riding over bumps on the road). With many (21+) gears you can find a gear (or a range of gears) to match the slope. The pros on TV are sometimes sprinting etc. You don't necessarily want to ride like they do, when you're commuting (and a self-described newbie). FWIW now that I'm more practised (5 times/week since March) I sometimes find myself taking a hill in a bigger gear than I used to: but still sitting, and spinning quickly. Obviously its easier to pedal in lower gears but then I feel like I'm just wasting my energy pedaling quickly and not getting anywhere. When approaching a hill from the bottom, approach at a good speed: fast cadence, high power, and a big gear. When you're onto the up-hill, increase your push slightly (to try to maintain your cadence even though you're now going up-hill). Depending on various things (short hill, enough reserve power) you might thus get all the way up the hill without changing gear (but this might be exhausting) and finish before you're even tired (you complete it quickly because you're going quickly). If you can't power up-hill in the big gear then your speed (and therefore your cadence) begins to drop. It's not worth letting your cadence drop: if you allow your cadence to halve, for example, then to maintain your power output you would need to double your pedal force to compensate (which you're not strong enough to). So whenever the terrain drags your cadence down to some minimum (e.g. 70 RPM) then shift down to an easier gear to compensate. Don't change down too far: only one gear at a time and only as necessary. The end result is that you're always pedalling at a good cadence and with a strong force: and that is as fast as you can go! Not ""wasting your energy"". When you change gears (especially on a hill) it's convenient if you have nice gears which let you shift quickly while you're loading the pedals, or which require you to ease up on the pedals (to avoid grinding and jumping the drive chain) for only a small fraction of a second. Postscript: I since moved to a hilly area (a few years ago) so I've had more practice. Wearing bike shoes (so my feet can't slip from the pedals), I now stand on the pedals to climb hills. My endurance has improved, so now I can sustain that for about 100 breaths consecutively before getting tired and sitting down. On a horizontal, you want a sustainable effort (you don't want to become exhausted after a couple of minutes). On a hill you may use a higher, less-sustainable effort because: Standing on the pedals puts quite a bit more weight (force) on them, so you can be in a higher gear and go faster etc. I almost never use the bike's lowest gears any more: the hills up which I used to spin, I now climb standing. In summary I think my earlier advice above is good, but with practice some people grow out of it."
Is it really necessary to physically cross (interlace) the spokes on traditional wheel lacing?,"Probably the best source for answering this is Jobst Brandt's The Bicycle Wheel, the definitive text on the wire-spoked wheel and an essential for anyone interested in the art of wheelbuilding.  Excerpted from page 68 of the 3rd edition: Spokes in a crossed pattern are usually interlaced at their last crossing before reaching the rim. Spokes coming from between the flanges are laid over those from outside the flanges. Interlaced spokes take up each other's slack during severe radial loading and reduce the chance of spokes becoming loose. If spokes become loose, their nipples can unscrew. Radial spokes cannot be interlaced and therefore, lose alignment from road shock more easily. Interlacing also gives more clearance between the spokes and the derailleur on rear wheels."
What makes a bike stay upright when moving?,"This question was recently the subject of a lengthy article in New Scientist magazine. To summarize: ""Why does this bicycle steer the proper amounts at the proper times to assure self-stability?"" the paper asks. ""We have found no simple physical explanation."" http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21028141.700-bike-to-the-drawing-board.html This article also cites the study that you could not quite place - gyroscopic forces, for so long thought to be the be all and end all of bicycle stability - have been scientifically proven to not be of the consequence popularly imagined. As for staying upright on a roller, that is not covered by the article, however, it does discuss what happens when you send a bike off down the street with nobody on it - seemingly the weight and steering adjustments made by the rider have nothing to do with it. I don't think that the New Scientist article is the last word on the subject. However it is recent (a few weeks old) and is a good introduction to the mystery. Enjoy!"
Parafin wax vs wet lube for bike chain lubrication?,"I have been using paraffin wax this year on my ""fast"" road bike as a bit of an experiment. This was using the hot wax approach, where paraffin wax was melted (in a slow cooker) and a clean chain dipped in the hot wax. Pros Cons When done right paraffin wax adheres to the metal and takes up the space between the rollers and inner links. Because the wax is solid at room temperature, this means the chain is running on a film of hard wax, which increase efficiency and reduces roller wear.  This only works if you prepare the chain correctly, otherwise the wax will not adhere and the wax will not remain between the rollers and inner plates/bushings (inner plates act as bushings in modern chains). Probably the most critical step for a successful hot waxing is preparing the chain.  All lube must be stripped off. EVERYTHING. No residue, just bare metal.  This is actually more difficult than it first sounds. I typically follow this tutorial by Molten Speed Wax (although I haven't tried their wax yet). The mineral spirits do a good job of stripping out oils, but they do leave a residue.  Mineral spirits is therefore followed by rubbing alcohol (isopropanol) baths, which leaves bear metals.  After drying the chain is ready for a hot wax treatment. Regular bike degreasers will likely not be strong enough. Solvents are expensive and potentially harmful to the environment so I  reuse my solvents, but moving them down the chain. I use about 6-7 sequential baths (4 mineral spirits, 3 alcohol).  Tedious! Afterwards solvents will need to be disposed/recycled at the proper facilities- not down the drain!!! 
Example of the debris removed from a new chain after the first solvent bath. Because of the tedium and work involved I tend to prepare batches of chains then rotate them on a bike.  This makes re-lubing as easy as swapping a chain. I also use master a link, which I tend to reuse a number of times before replacing. Re-waxing is as simple as wiping any dust or dirt off of the chain and re-inserting into hot wax again. Any remaining dirt tends to fall out of the chain as you mix the pot, settling on the bottom.  Afterwards you can cut out the dirty wax which settles to the bottom of the pot.  I typically keep my re-waxing wax separate from my first time wax which is pristine. Right now I get good longevity in the dry, even better in the cold and dry (as the wax is harder), but I have no idea the longevity in the wet and muddy.  I remember the Velonews test showed good friction performance (the paraffin keeps out mud) but I am not sure anyone looked at longevity (i.e., how long before re-waxing). Once I set my commuter up on a waxed chain I will have a better of how this may pan out. The wear rate of Paraffin treated chain is significantly lower (p < 0.001) with a wear rate about 40% of the wear rate measured while using oil.  In the figure below oil was used on the chain for the first 100 hours before switching to paraffin.  The slope of the regression lines indicates the wear rate, with the shaded region indicating the 95% confidence region for the regression line. Note that the measured wear drops slightly after switching to paraffin, my best guess is that the wax fills some of the space between the roller and pin, effectively reducing measured stretch.  Wet weather riding with a paraffin waxes chain is a mixed bag. The waxing doesn’t last as long as in dry weather due to the wet and grit wearing away the wax. Typically torrential down pour conditions on gravel tracks I get about four one way commutes (about 100 km) before I swap chains.  If it is light or misting rain I can get a week’s worth or more. To rewax the chain I wipe off the dirt off the chain with a wet rag, let the chain dry then throw it into the hot wax. The one big plus is that the drivetrain remains relatively clean and can be polished in a couple minutes with a wet rag. Wet lubes would produce a nasty mess under the same conditions. In the end there is no free lunch, there is always more  maintenance in winter."
Should I fear cows? How can I encourage them to let me pass?,"In short: You don't have to fear cows, but a healthy dose of respect is appropriate. Normally cow herds aren't really aggressive. Therefore, it's quite safe to just go around the herd (if it's blocking the trail), or pass the herd if it's close to the trail. Going right through the herd is unwise unless you know what you're doing. Additional caution is advised when encountering: If either of the above situations are present, keep your distance. Consider leaving extra space between you and the herd, so as not to get too close. Depending on the size of their meadow, it may be easiest to just avoid their meadow altogether, or at least stay 50 to 100 meters away."
What tint colors are most useful for cycling sunglasses?,"There are many factors that influence choices. -  terrain you ride, sunlight intensity, shade effects etc, and personal preference. A quick internet search will give you technical answers on what colors do look here .  For me personally, I mostly Mountain Bike, I live in New Zealand, which has extremely high UV light levels. Therefore I do not venture out for more than an hour without some protection. I will use different glasses for different rides, but only because I have them. For use while riding, the all rounder is Yellow, for other things as well, I would head towards amber. If correct color perception is important, then you will struggle to get glass that work as well as Yellows/Amber's - especially in low light.    The advantage of the blue filters (blue blockers) is they lift depth perception and contrast - maybe roadies don't need it, but off road MTB it is a definite advantage.    Clear - I use these where protection from things other than sunlight is desirable (insects, sticks, dust etc), and maximum use of available light essential - mostly night riding.  Yellow - I use these a majority of my riding. Do a great job at smoothing the transition from shade to full sunlight (i.e. I can see into dark forest from bright sunlight). On bright days, let too much light in for comfort (But still protect from damaging UV). Mine are specific sports style - not really a fashion accessory....  Amber - Similar to yellow, but filter more light, making the shade a bit darker. Probably my most versatile sun glasses - use them when the yellows will look dorky -rides with family, beached etc.  Blue/polarised -  Better color perception so I use the driving, fishing and general wear. Mine are pretty much towards the ""fashion"" end of the style range, not good for riding - too dark for forests.   "
How to choose a Local Bike Shop,"I make a little list of the nearby shops at each end of my daily commute. Then I visit them. I actually try to visit 4 or 5 regardless of how much I like the first one, just to have an idea of what they're like in case I need one. What I look for: decent range of product in the shop. Stuff that's relevant to me, but also a reasonable range of other stuff. Shops with few accessories for sale are usually either just starting out, or just about to fold. more than one mechanic. Sorry, but a one man shop is going to suffer from not having anyone to bounce ideas off and having to close when the one mechanic is out learning new stuff (or more often, not out learning at all). approachable staff. Do I feel comfortable dealing with the staff? Do they know about bikes or just about sales targets? Are they surly, minimum-wage grunts or are they happy working there? I don't want my bike serviced by someone who's doing the minimum possible to avoid getting fired. decent workshop. A corner of the back office with a portable stand is not a workshop. I have a better workshop than that at home (I realise not everyone does). Working in poor conditions means doing a poor job. decent range of tools. They should have the expensive bottom bracket taps and so on hanging on the wall next to the usual allen key sets and so on. Those tools are too fragile to drop in a tool drawer, and if the bike shop doesn't know that (or worse, doesn't have the tools at all), I don't want them working on my bike. If they don't have the tools to do the job properly I don't want to risk them trying to bodge it. sensible opening hours. Look, I know it sucks having to start work at 7am, but that's when the customers start riding past the shop. And closing up at 7pm makes for a very long day, another reason to avoid single-staff-member shops. But if I can't drop my bike off in the morning, grab a loaner bike and pick it up that night, I'm not very happy. loaner bikes. To a bike shop a restored second hand bike is cheap. They're a useful place to train or evaluate new staff, and customers love them. Expect to see rare or strange parts, because customers do steal stuff off those bikes. But that's ok, it just has to work. does not have a standard service price. A standard $50 service sounds great but if you're doing any maintenance on your bike at all most of it's going to be wasted. They will replace your 25% worn brake pads because that's in the service. They will not tighten the loose spoke because that is not. And the service will probably be done by an unsupervised 15 year old being paid per bicycle serviced. Sure, if every shop in your area offers it the good shop might have to play along. I'd still be skeptical - and ask them why.  demands a way to contact me if they find something ugly. A shop that can't ring me to say 'Cthulu lives in your seatpost' hasn't got enough experience to be allowed to pump up tyres. Specific to me is that they have to at least know what a Rohloff is, and a Schmidt hub dyno. I have both, and both can be expensively damaged by monkeys with hammers. But also, selling the high end stuff means they have customers who care about their bikes a lot. Few rich louts buy Rohloffs, they just don't have the bling factor. Instead, it's people who really care about their bike. Where I worked for a while it wasn't the rich customers who bought them, it was the ""saved up and got the special treat"" ones. The rich dudes were the ones with a Mercx frame who wanted an all period restoration and would go ""a Phil bottom bracket? Whatever makes it go"". Or they would go somewhere that had a selection of $10k carbon fibre road bikes in stock. Our customers were more the ""I'm going to ride around India for a year, I want..."", and had a detailed list. Anyway, bike shops with that lot are more likely to be off the main road where rent is cheaper, might not open on Sunday, probably cost a bit more but to me are well worth the effort."
What to do with old tires?,"I usually gift them to people who need them. Edit: To expand more on my answer, I use rather expensive tyres and I want them in mint condition. So after a couple of months I'll most probably change them. The old tyres can still give 6-12 months of quality riding time to someone. So I'll post on local riding forums with closeup photos of the tread and usually people will get them."
Can cycling adversely affect male fertility?,"Most scientific studies on cycling and urogenital problems are written with clinicians in mind, to make them aware of possible symptoms that they will encounter. Often these studies get summarized into review articles. One such article (Leibovitch and Mor, 2005), reviewed 62 relevant studies. They say: The reported incidence of bicycling related urogenital symptoms
  varies considerably. The most common bicycling associated urogenital
  problems are nerve entrapment syndromes presenting as genitalia
  numbness, which is reported in 50–91% of the cyclists, followed by
  erectile dysfunction reported in 13–24%. Other less common symptoms
  include priapism, penile thrombosis, infertility, hematuria, torsion
  of spermatic cord, prostatitis, perineal nodular induration and
  elevated serum PSA, which are reported only sporadically. When examined individually, many of these studies have limitations (small number of study subjects, no followup, etc.), but when taken as a whole, they are pretty conclusive that an association exists between cycling and urogenital problems. The only study that I could find that was population-based, i.e., included men with a range of cycling durations, was Marceau et al., 2001. Their data on 1,709 men come from the Massachusetts Male Aging Study. After controlling for potentially confounding factors (""age, energy expenditure, smoking, depression and chronic illness""), they found that men who cycled more than 3 hours per week were 72% more likely to have erectile disfunction than those who cycled less than 3 hours per week. They are cautious, however (emphasis mine): Bicycling 3 h or more per week may be associated with ED. Data
  revealed that there may be a reduced probability of ED in those who
  ride less than 3 h per week and ED may be more likely in bikers who
  ride more than 3 h per week. More population-based research is needed
  to better define this relationship. The last sentence is key. Granted, there are drawbacks to population-based studies like this. One major problem is that the data are self-reported. Another drawback is they their sample probably does not include elite or high-level sport cyclists, who might have better equipment or better technique. Does this mean that your experience may vary? Absolutely."
How to choose a bicycle seat,"Choosing a saddle that fits you is very important. The wrong saddle can lead to numbness and pain in the crotch area, and in the long run serious health issues. The right saddle for you should fit comfortably regardless of what type of riding you do and will depend mainly on the width of your pelvic. Ideally you should get a professional fit. If one is not available to you, you should try a few saddles of different sizes to determine what fits you before you purchase. "
Sequence for a complete road bike overhaul,I have two overhaul checklist links that are great. One of the checklists I modified for personal use and have included. The first is from United Bicycle Institute (checklist PDF link) - UBI is one of the premier US bike mechanics schools. The one below I modified from the A Convenient Cycle blog (the blog is now dead...) and is what I use in my personal shop.
What does the label on a tire mean?,"The 40 is the inflated width in mm and the 622 is the internal diameter in mm. It's the international standard ISO-5775 for tire sizes. In brackets are the French size (700mm outer diameter x 38mm width) and the Inch size (28 outer diameter x 1 5/8 height x 1 1/2 width) Wikipedia has a very detailed explanation of tire sizes and designations, I confirmed my answer on this page."
What exercise should I do in the gym to assist with hill-climbing?,"In many ways this needs to be individualized. My experience has been in century type rides during the summers over the last 15 years. Most of which are in hilly and mountainous regions in Oregon and Washington. The suggestions following are what I have refined during that period based on experience and significant reading on the subject. Additionally, I work part time as a fitness trainer, and have helped others train for centuries.  During the off-season, which for me runs from November through February, my primary goals in the gym are strength, power and stability. After February, the gym work is minimal and training shifts to riding. I can't provide a complete description here, but here's a summary of my program related to climbing ability.  Finally, during the course of the off-season I am cycling through these strength, power and stability workouts. For myself it's approximately 60% strength, 20% power, and 20% stability. How one cycles through these workouts is highly individualistic and is based on goals and one's fitness level. For example, in the last 3 weeks, I've done strength work on Monday and Friday with plyometrics on Wednesday. And next week will be 3 or 4 stability workouts. The next planned century is in mid May. In March, I'll drop the strength and power training and move to almost exclusively to ""on bike"" training. The guide I follow pretty closely is The Time-Crunched Cyclist by Chris Carmichael and Jim Rutberg. And just a note...the workout plan is not specifically and only for hill climbing. Through experience, I've found that the stronger I am going into the ""season"", the better I perform. Additionally, my other sports and daily living activities are improved as well. An update...not to belabor The Time-Crunched Cyclist, but both I and riding partners have significantly improved our personal performance on hilly to mountainous century rides using Carmichael's methods. There are 3 types of intervals specific to climbing improvement. Not the full details, but a summary. Mix these into your training rides. Generally, not all three on the same day, and not on consecutive days; but these intervals once or twice a week should yield results.  Climbing Repeats - Done a long, steady climb. Staying within 78 - 80% of Max Heart Rate for the climb with a cadence of 70 - 85 rpm. This increases climbing lactate threshold. (3X, 6 minutes each, 3 minute rest between) Hill Acceleration - On a long, moderate climb, pedal slowly until reaching the last 500 yards. Then gradually speed up so that you are at near max heart rate. Finish out of the saddle at max effort. (4X, 10 seconds, 3 minute rest between) Hill Sprint - Roll at a moderate speed in a moderate to light gear. As you hit the hill, jump out of the saddle and go hard. Try to hold top speed. Increases power for acceleration. (4X, 10 seconds, 3 minute rest between) "
The chemistry of mixing sealants,"If your tire has begun to lose air slowly (loses 10 PSI over 2 days), it has lost the liquid carrier in your sealant. The remainder of the sealant is dry or lumpy and can't travel to the new thorn. It was ammonia or environmentally friendly antifreeze (not ethelene glycol) that evaporated. Like the original liquid is pretty much gone. Our riding club carries Orange seal and Stan's in portable 3 ounce bottles. We use it interchangeably any time a member gets a low tire on the trail. Never had an issue. "
Should unconventional colors be avoided for lighting?,"Most places will legally require you to run with white lights on the front and red lights behind. This is crucially important because it immediately tells everybody else on the road whether you're coming towards them or moving away. I once nearly hit somebody because they had a red light on the front of their bike. I saw that at the usual distance and dismissed it as a low priority, expecting it to be tens of seconds before I reached them and needed to deal with it. Then suddenly they were on me because we were coming towards each other and closing at 40+km/h, rather than moving in the same direction and closing at 5km/h. Do not use random other colours because you think they look prettier. Vehicle lighting serves a critical safety function. It's not about looking pretty. If you just have a blue light on the front of your bike, that does not say ""Everybody pay attention: I am coming towards you!"" It just says ""I'm probably not very important so deal with the other stuff and come back to me if you have time later to figure out what I am."" Blue has the additional disadvantage that human eyes are much less sensitive to blue light than other colours. Blue, especially flashing blue, is reserved for the use of the emergency services in some jurisdictions. If you want to put additional lights on your bike, standard colours are still better. If legal in your country, use a flashing white and a solid white on the front, or use two solids; ditto with red on the rear. Or put extra lights on your helmet or somewhere on your body. The standard colours convey important information; other colours are just decoration and people don't pay attention to decoration."
Are Z-shaped cranks a good idea?,"If the aluminum is sufficiently stiff it makes zero difference -- the crank could be any shape (a disk, an S shape, etc), but the relationship between the two contact points would still remain the same, and that's all that counts. The only effect the crank could have is adding a bit of spring to the crank, which might be good or bad for effective cranking.  But aluminum makes lousy springs, and if it flexes much it will soon fatigue and fail. The risk to your body parts is getting cut by sharp edges when the crank fails."
What aspects contribute most to me being slow on this bike?,"Since no-one else posted this as an answer (Vladimir touched on it in comments) i'm going to add it.  Please don't take this the wrong way, its not designed to be insulting. Simply put, you are slow because you are not bike fit (general fitness is not the same as bike fitness). You are right about all of the things that make your bike inefficient and slowing you down, but the biggest factor is the 'engine'.  Your answer contains several indications that you are not bike fit. Other riders you are seeing on Strava/Garmin that appear to be so much faster ARE that much faster. Some of it is about the bike, but a huge part is because they are training regularly, following training plans etc. To give a little personal context, I was averaging around 21km/h on my MTB on off-road routes last year - on flat routes or taking the MTB on road this was closer to 25km/h for rides of up to 120km.  I'd consider myself fit, but still not anywhere close to an elite level of performance."
Why is a road bike faster than a city bike with the same effort? How much faster it can be?,"Having made the change myself, I can confirm that shock absorbers are actually detrimental to city riding. You lose a lot of power, especially when trying to stand on the pedals for acceleration. Road bikes are also typically much lighter, which in my experience not only helps you go uphill faster, but also makes it a lot easier to carry the bike when necessary.  For instance when I am leaving my place, with my old bike I would've had to clumsily roll it out, but with the road bike I can just carry it out to the street.  It's not something you typically think about, but it saves time.  As a final note, while you can't turn a mountain bike into a road bike, you can make some changes that would improve it's road performance a bit. One thing you can do is swap out your normal nubby tires for slicks. Slick tires, pumped to the appropriate pressure, will reduce your rolling resistance. Also if your shocks are the adjustable kind, then increase the firmness, or even lock them entirely, so that they won't waste as much of your energy."
"What applications exist for bicycle power, besides propulsion? [closed]","Bicycles are simply a method of generating rotational mechanical movement from biological sources. That rotational energy can be used for anything where a motor would be used. The items below have all been successful in that they accomplish the original design goal/intent, but we don't really see them in modern life because small electric and liquid-fuel motors do the same job faster and with less sweat. Water Pump
  with sufficient plumbing, a water source, and a purpose a bicycle can lift water. This one is essentially a ""rubbee"" style of interface so a normal bike can power the tool by tyre friction.  This bike could be taken off and used for other purposes.  This will cause wear on the tyre just like a set of rollers, so tyres will wear faster. By comparison, a dedicated setup might have replaced the rear wheel, locating the pump's axle where the wheel's axle was, and fitting a suitably-sized cog so the chain could drive it.  If the derailleur was left in place then several cogs could produce different flow rates for the same RPM, but the bike can't be used for anything else. Air pump
Bomb shelters need ventilation, which often needs to be forced so to not asphyxiate the occupants.  Air raids of WW2 were very likely to stop any electricity flow, so a human powered air pump was the answer.

In the same environment, a pedal-powered generator could run a radio set for information, and for lighting.  They also provide warmth, for the riders.
A bike-style setup could be installed as a backup to main pumps, enough to keep the mine running while repairs are effected. Lathe

Concepts like the Dynapod and Energy Cycle were intended to be a human-powered stationary engine, that could run a range of devices in the field.  The Dynapod could drive pumps, corn grinders, winnowing machines, forge blowers, grinding machines, drilling machines, potter's wheels, paint sprayers, crop dusting equipment, cassave graters, coffee pulpers, grain hullers, fibre decorticators, threshers, balers, band saws, tire pumps and sewing machines. It could also be used to generate electricity. These could run in direct drive 1:1, or 3:1 or 10:1 so the speed and torque requirements of the driven gear were met. These could even be used to till/plough a field by dragging a weighted implement across the ground on a wire rope.

How can I look unsafe to a car driver but be safe,"In the city, it's best to ""take the lane"" and behave like traffic. However, on country roads, I prefer to do the following. When you hear/notice a car approaching, weave out about a meter into the road, then weave back. Repeat this a couple times, until the car is very close, then just hold your line on the edge of the road. The car will worry that you might weave again, and give you ample room.  "
Is it bad etiquette to ride road bike through a small residential area?,I wouldn't consider it to be bad etiquette IF: In small neighborhoods like this it's also not a bad idea to stay out in the lane and not hug the curb. This gives you much more time if a car or child comes hurtling out into the road and you're not going to be slowing down a following car very much. Edit: include the warning to watch for dogs. This is pretty important.
How much easier is it to go fast on a road bike and why?,
Whatever happened to solid bike tubes?,"You should not be getting multiple flat tires in such a short timespan. I commute on poorly-maintained roads in Atlanta, and have not had a flat tire in 4,000 miles. In order of estimated likelihood, either: If you've just started cycling again, I think it's exceedingly probable that you've simply neglected to inflate your tires to their recommended pressure. Standard road tires should be inflated to pressures of 100PSI and beyond. Mountain bike tires (which are awful for road use, but I digress...) require much less. It's easy to grossly underestimate how much to inflate a bike tire, and a standard hand pump will likely only get you to 30-60 PSI before you give up. Take your bicycle to your nearest bike shop and have them examine the situation. Flat tires should not be a common occurrence."
Is standing up and pedaling on multi-gear bicycles a bad idea,"As (almost) always, the great Sheldon Brown has covered this particular topic. Standing while Cycling To Sit or to Stand? It is my belief that a great many cyclists stand up to pedal much more often than they should. I've often said: ""If you find yourself standing to accelerate, on level ground, it is a sign that your gear is too high or that your saddle is too low.""
  Standing pedaling allows you to apply more force to the pedals than is possible seated, because you can rest your entire weight on the driven pedal, and, even more, by pulling up on the handlebar, you can push the pedal with more than your actual weight...but is this a good thing?
  Pedaling that hard is very stressful to the joints, and to the bicycle, and usually involves a level of effort that cannot be sustained aerobically. Unless you have unusually good form, it also tends to involve a fair amount of thrashing from side to side, which is a waste of energy. The added stress flexes many parts of the bicycle, and the energy required to do this flexing is not usually recovered when the parts straighten back out. These extreme stresses also greatly increase the risk of breaking things. If a pedal, crank, chain, handlebar or handlebar stem should break under this abnormal stress (a very real possibility) you are almost certain to suffer injury in the resulting crash. Even a simple missed shift or the skipping of a worn chain can toss you to the ground when you throw all of your weight onto a single pedal. You should never stand up to pedal a bicycle that you do not know to be in excellent mechanical condition!"
What is the downside to me purchasing a road bike instead of a hybrid?,"The real answer is that for a 9km ride, virtually any bike will do the trick. It's hard to be uncomfortable on a bike (that fits you) for that short of a ride. However, I'm fully in the road bike camp on this question. Hybrids are, in my opinion, a compromise with no real benefits. Most people aren't going to ride them off-road (and most road bikes can deal with short periods of offroad travel without problems). Cushioned saddles look great to novices, but divert weight away from your sit bones and are all but guaranteed to be uncomfortable should you decide to ride longer distances (for this reason, I can't recommend leather saddles highly enough, particularly Brooks'). The knobby tires that come standard on most hybrids have poor road  handling characteristics, and actually result in less traction on the road in wet conditions (bicycles cannot hydroplane). On the contrary, a properly setup road commuter will offer you more hand positions via the drop handlebars (on the flats, the hoods, and drops) compared to just one. This will be invaluable for longer rides where your hands fatigue from maintaining one position. They can come with wider non-racing tires (I commute on 28C Panaracer Ribmo tires, and haven't had a flat in over 10,000km). And appropriate commuting frames come with rack and pannier bosses, and many will have racks preinstalled. So while a hybrid bike will work, an appropriately-equipped road bike would be better in that it will be able to adapt to your needs should find yourself wanting to ride longer distances or join faster group rides."
How to find punctures in inner tubes?,"Do whatever works, really.  The problem with the container of water approach is that it requires a container of water. It won't damage the tube. Also, if you need to patch the tube, you have to wait for the wet tube to dry. So, I'd generally recommend doing this last (usually leaks are not subtle enough to need the immersion), but no harm going there first.  The usual technique I use is to try to blow up the tube a bit and put the tube near my upper lip if I can't find the leak by ear or feel it around the tube with my hands; the upper lip area is pretty sensitive, so its pretty easy to detect it. Try to be systematic about it, like start with the valve and go clockwise. If you jump around all willy nilly, you'll take longer to find it.  Sometimes you get leaks that are too slow for that, and generally in those cases, you end up replacing the tube anyway.  You can also trace the leak by checking near the valve (a common culprit; if its the valve itself in a Schrader valve, you can spit on it and check for bubbles) as well as running your hand along the tire to see if anything is there. If you make sure to align the label of the tire (e.g. where it says ""Continental"" or whatever) over the valve, its easy to work back to where the leak is if you find something (since the label and valve are in the same position, the position of what you found relative to the label tells you where the leak is on the tube).  See this page as well. It also covers what leaks mean stuff (if you have a thorn in the tire, chances are that's your cause, for example. Snakebites are often insufficient tire pressure. If you have a leak on the rim side of the tube, chances are theres something off with your rim tape, etc.). "
Why Do I Need a Better/Lighter Road Bicycle to Train For 'Fitness'?,"Rob, you are correct that a heavier bike will give you a greater fitness benefit over the same distance. The only real counter-point I have is that the most effective bikes for fitness are the ones that get ridden. So, if some reason a lighter bike would more fun or appealing to you (while still be a ""good enough"" commuter), than a lighter bike could be a better choice for you.  In my experience, extra weight is not noticed much for commuting, so I'd rather have the durability of CroMoly over aluminum or carbon, and the practical benefits of fenders, racks, lights and bags. An anecdote: My wife rides a bike with electric assist. You might think electric assist would reduce the fitness benefit, but opposite is true for her. She takes more trips because she has electric assist (including carrying one or two children plus cargo), and thus ends up riding-- and pedaling-- more than if she had an unassisted bike. Some will suggest that you should get a lighter bike for ""social"" riding. That depends on who you ride with and what their fitness levels and interests are. I'm personally a stronger rider, and prefer to ride with my wife, parents and older friends, as well my children. For me, having a bike that's a bit heavier improves the social parity and helps to me ride naturally closer to the same speed with the people I prefer to ride with. If you want a hang with ""Group A"" club rides, lighter would be way the go instead.  Whatever gets you out riding the most is best bike for you."
Removing a stuck pedal,"Lengthening the wrench is your best bet.  You don't need anything fancy, find a bit of pipe at your local hardware shop that fits over the wrench. Watch your fingers.  While trying to remove a tricky pedal, it gave suddenly and my knuckles hit the teeth of the chain ring.  It was a daft and bloody mistake."
How to store bicycles outside during winter,"Here's my solution.  Take off wheels, pedals, and handlebars, and place the bike under the bed.  Ok, that may not be the right solution, but it might point you in the right direction.  If you start taking parts off your bike, you can fit it in a pretty small place.  You might even want to consider taking parts off and storing everything but the frame inside your apartment.  Take out the bottom bracket and leave that in the house.  Wheels can be easily stored inside.  The seat/seat post is dead easy to remove and can be stored just about anywhere.  Basically you should store as much inside as you can.  "

What different frame materials have been used?,"Bones Density average 1.84 g/cm³ for dry bone. This would be a pretty bad material for a bike frame, and its quite likely that any bone bike really has a metal core in the middle.  Advantage  Disadvantage  Bones aren't particularly structural by themselves.  A skeleton is made from tendons and cartilage and soft tissues as well. Durability - bones that dry out get brittle and will snap easily. Intolerant - A crack could go from a minor hairline to a full break very quickly."
Why can't I use my new pedal indoors?,As other have commented it appears to be based a legal opinion. While there is no physical reason they would not work the safety side says having sharp pins sticking out would not be a good idea. The potential for someone to strike a shin against the pedal warrants the warning.
Why are aluminum frames painted at all?,"Not only does aluminum oxidize, it can completely decompose. It is not just some surface film, the structural integrity can be broken and the part can become fragile. This is well known by climbers and especially cavers, because carabiners or bolt hangers oxidized to a significant degree are a common sight in certain regions (depending on the chemical composition of the rain, the rock and closeness to sea and also on temperature - in Alpine caves and cold mountain walls they do not rust too fast). 
https://www.scavalon.be/avalonuk/discov/emotions_corrosion.htm It is vital to protect the metal of climbing items that are left outdoors or in a cave if possible, by painting or by anodising. Many bikes are not left outside, but still are brought home wet or even contaminated by road salt and the galvanic corrosion is a danger for both the climbing equipment and bicycles. That said, some surfaces do often feature naked aluminium alloys, most often the rims, especially with rim brakes. Disc brake rims are often painted as well as the rest of the bike. One should just be aware that corrosion can happen, but bikes that are taken care of or stored inside should be fine. The most danger there is probably in damp hot areas at the sea."
What happened to Belgium's bicycle registration scheme?,"These plates were actually not ""registration plates"", but proofs of payment of the bicycle tax — so you had to renew them every year. The bicycle tax has been removed from 1986 to 1998 (depending on where you lived, it was a provincial tax), and so were the ""tax plates"". From what I could understand, the tax yielded actually very low (30 belgian francs in 1986, so more or less the price of a daily newspaper, plus the cost of producing the plate and the paperwork), and not really enforced. More info here"
Is it worth buying a lighter bike? If so what kind?,"IMHO, it's not the weight that is hurting you the most. While weight makes a difference and a lighter bike would be much better, it's too common in cycling world for people to use weight as a proxy quality and performance. Any twit with scales can measure it.  That said, there is no doubt more suitable bike would make longer trips faster, and a better quality bike even more so, but only you can decide if the cost is worth it. Weight only affects hills and acceleration. For a long ride mostly on the road we can practically ignore the effects of acceleration. On the hills, lets say you shaved 10kg off the bike, your total weight is now 75kg instead of 85kg. From this calculator, a 100M climb over 10km will take 38 minutes on the lighter bike vs 40 minutes on the heavier bike. Using these rough numbers, the calculator comes up with figures that are close enough to help you decide ""Is it worth it"" However, resistance and power loss from a bike such as this are a big factor that cannot be ignored.  New tires that are a hybrid might be more suitable—a bit of lost time in the forest for faster riding on the rest of the trip might be a trade off. Something like Schwalbe Hurricane would be a goods starting point.  The shock and fork should be tightened as much as possible, since I doubt they have lockout.  Your position on the bike, getting more aerodynamic would make a big difference—bar ends could help with this. While the perfect bike for you sounds like a gravel bike, there is no need to head down the path of very expensive to get a significant improvement in performance. A hard tail 29"" MTB running something like the Hurricanes would be ideal and handle the forest section with ease. A drop bar bike running 35mm tires would be good if you are a skilled rider and happy to take the wins on the road for some drawbacks in forest sections. Before buying, ask around and see if someone you know has a bike they may be prepared to lend you for a couple of rides—you might be surprised who has an old bike in need of an outing..."
What can be done to make a trainer work quieter?,"Baffling - place it on carpet or a rug (and several towels), this will both stop vibration through the floor and catch the drips of sweat. "
Noticeable clicking from crankset or bottom bracket,"I've had a similar clicking experience. Not really varying under different load, nor at a certain position of crank arms. Everyone I asked said to me it was the ball bearings in the bottom bracket. I pulled the BB out, spinned it in my hands, heard all sort of creaking sounds coming out of it - as if it was full of sand. Bought the new one, installed it: et voilà, no clicking.  Bottom bracket was two years old with about 4000 km on it (FSA if I'm not mistaken)."
Which kind of tube valve is the best?,"Presta's main benefit is more about how the valve functions, in regards to getting pumped up to higher pressures.  Because the stem of the valve needs pressure in the pump head to get high enough before it pushes the valve stem in, and start flowing air into the tire, when you try to get to 120 to 160 lbs of pressure it works better than a Schrader valve where the valve stem is depressed the whole time, back pressure can leak out. Otherwise I would say tomato - tomahto (potato - potaato?)"
Do cyclists warrant special consideration under traffic laws?,"Before posting this list, I need to preface it with my position that riding in a predictable manner, as much like a 'vehicle' as possible is safest to me.  To a large degree I disagree with treating bicycles differently because: It confuses interaction with
motorists, especially at
intersections where the risk is
highest for cyclists.  Not all motorists or cyclist will know their
rights/responsibilities.  It's hard
enough to educate both side now. I think the time/speed/safety gains for
the average cyclist would be very
small. That said there are exceptions in almost every jurisdiction already, allowing use on paths and sidewalks, allowing passing on the right, etc. - these are the common arguments I hear in favor of different treatment, primarily as it relates to an Idaho style 'Stop as Yield' law: Bicyclists have to expend their own energy to start and stop--it's a courtesy to let them pass just as it is to yield to someone carrying something heavy or bulky. Bicyclists have better awareness of surroundings (better field of vision, higher than cars. fewer distractions). Bicyclists can avoid collisions better (sharper turning radius, much less width, less speed and weight to manage, can become flush with the side of the road almost instantly, can stop in a shorter distance); Most bicyclists treating a stop as a yield pass through stop signs at a similar speed as most motorists (who usually don't stop), but comparing the straightaway speed difference, it may seem like the motorist is ""stopping"" while the cyclist isn't. Stopped cyclists are unable to avoid the pollution of stopped cars. Pollution tends to be highest at stops. Cyclists waiting in traffic can cause more problems for all--not only by blocking turns (which often elicits prejudicial anger from motorists) but there is an increased chance of being rear-ended for the cyclist. (Proper lane positioning avoids this - gr) Frequent stopping is associated with long-term chronic knee problems from the pressure required to start again. Most cyclists responsibly ""run"" stop signs at present, showing that the law simply doesn't work for people. Cyclists don't endanger the public as cars do and have not been properly accommodated for--this is due in large part to short-sighted planning that doesn't recognize the benefits of cycling. Places that treat bicyclists as special users, with high levels of accommodation have much lower bicycle fatality rates than the USA (e.g., Netherlands, about 1/13 our fatality rates per mile traveled). One of the reasons is that they give cyclists a head start through red lights, with special zones ahead of motor traffic, and special bicycle-only green lights."
Why are battery-powered lights so popular?,"The main advantage, in my view, is that you can more easily add/remove battery-powered lights. Why this may be desirable: Theft resilience. I take my lights off the bike and carry them with me if I'm parking my bike outdoors for longer than a few minutes. Caveats: This can be more of a downside than a benefit, depending on your situation. (I can't imagine a thief taking the time to steal a generator-powered light, but I'm sure it happens sometimes.) Flexibility. I don't bother to take my lights with me unless I know I'm possibly going to need them. If I used a generator-powered light, I would be pretty much stuck with it all the time, even if I'm only going to ride during the day. Caveats: This is, however, not much of a positive thing, unless the lights you use are particularly heavy, or you happen to be a ""weight weenie"". Interchangeability. I can swap my lights between my bikes very easily. Most decent battery-powered lights have an adjustable removable clamp that you can use to attach the light to any style of handlebar/seat post/other tube that you could possibly want. This means that I only need one set of lights that I can use between all of my bikes. Caveats: If you don't like to spend an extra 5 minutes swapping your lights every time you want to ride a different bike, this is not a plus."
Why is a tandem harder to ride uphill than a single rider bike?,"Everyone climbs at their own best rate and cadence. On a tandem, both riders have to ride at the same rate and cadence, which will be closest to those of the strongest rider. So neither of them are climbing at their best rate and cadence. On a tandem with very well matched riders, they are in fact quicker, largely due to the draughting effect of the two riders being so close together. On the other hand, if the hill is so steep that the riders would have to stand, it becomes a matter of rider skills. Many tandem riders struggle to master the two-person coordination of efforts required to make the transition to the standing position."
How to pass another bicycle in a bike lane,"You're doing the right thing by generally staying to the right.  Nobody should pass you on the right, which is a bit dangerous because you don't expect it and because there isn't as much room.  (I'm speaking for countries where people drive on the right side of the road.  In countries where people drive on the left, then bicyclists should pass on the right, of course.  Also, as @g.rocket points out, if the bike lane is on the 'left' side of a one-way street as is common in New York City, that is to say on the other side from where it would be if the road were two-way, then one should ride on the 'left' and pass on the 'right'.) The correct way to pass is to first announce your intent, either by ringing a bell or saying ""passing on your left"" or something similar.  Then pass on the left. I think the best way to make it easier for others to pass is to be aware of your surroundings (a mirror helps), to stay to the right, and to ride predictably.  As @JoshCaswell notes, when you are being passed, resist the urge to move further to the right and just keep going in a straight line.  Point before you turn!"
Why is BMX gearing so low,"The tracks do not have many long stretches and so cornering and getting ahead of the pack is a lot more important than going fast in the flats. The gearing on a race BMX is higher than on one you will buy out of the store. Most BMX will come with 44:16 gear ratio where racers will use 46-48:16, and I have seen higher. (There are different rear sizes but the standard is 16 when talking about Gear Ratios, even if you ride 9t or 14t rear you almost always know the conversion to 16t.) Most racers will start with 44/45:16 then move up when they build their leg muscles to handle the higher ratios, but even then you really need that hole-shot a lot more than you need the higher end speed. If the tracks had longer straights like a mountain bike course you might see more bikes with multiple gears and even higher gearing. As it stands, the berms are where you make your moves and getting in and out of the berms require more power than raw speed. I raced 44:16 against guys with 46:16 and never placed lower than 3rd. You want more power than over all speed on a race track. On street or in park you want even lower gearing, especially when you are trying to get that last pop before jumping up onto a rail."
SPD shoes that look like normal shoes,"I wear a pair of Austin Pedal shoes by Keen to work at my government office every day. They're a fine shoe—they look decent and accept SPDs. They aren't anything special.  There is no Gore-Tex liner (I think it'd be overkill for my commute most days).  There is no reflective tab, though that would be nice.  There is no carbon-reinforced toe-box—also probably overkill for my commuter shoe. I think that they are a pretty good match for what they do.  I have worn them to symphony, job interviews, and meetings with the higher-ups.  No worries. I guess that, since you really are polling, I would suggest that I wish that they came in more colors!  It would be nice if there were more options.  I purchased these specifically because they didn't look like cycling shoes—not that I think cycling shoes are distasteful.  I did want something that I could wear around though, that would never be a potential distraction for others."
Is a leather saddle appropriate for all-weather riding?,"I've used a Brooks saddle in a similar climate (Vancouver, BC) without any major issues.  Treat the topside with Proofide every 6-12 months and keep the underside dry (fenders, wedge bag, etc).  Store the bike in a dry place between rides so that the leather can dry out naturally.  A saddle cover would probably help but I've never used one."
Where to find good bicycle maintenance info?,
How can I recycle a broken titanium frame?,"Thanks for thinking about recycling this rather than just doing the easy thing and putting it in the landfill. You could try searching for a metal recycler near you. If they pay you, it might not be a lot, but it would be better than just the landfill. I'd urge people to consider doing this even if they don't pay you, because ti is a useful metal. For example, Leder Brothers is near where I live in the United States, and they say they will purchase scrap titanium (and other specialty metals.) I'm not sure exactly what keywords to use, however. On Google Maps, the business type for Leder Bros was ""Recycling center."" ""Scrap metal recycling"" may also show results. I'm not sure if all metal recyclers will take titanium. Ti wasn't listed on the website of one other metal recycler I visited, but this one did list Ti. See the other answer for a German term to use, as the OP is likely from Germany. I should point out one thing - you asked the frame manufacturer about repair options, but I am not sure how many frame manufacturers are set up to repair Ti frames, and bike shops might not know about Ti frame repairers. Single builders might consider it. Ticycles.com explicitly offers repair services. It might still not be economical to repair, but it's something you could consider in addition to trying to recycle."
How to descend mountain roads?,"Whilst I come from a mountain bike background so my advice might be different from someone with a road background, I've found the following tips work well when I've been on a road bike in the mountains. On wet roads, go slower :-) The same advice applies, but it's even more important to not use the front brake in the corner. And in gravel, take it slow - it's just not worth taking risks because you can lose the front wheel without any warning. The best way to lean to descend mountain roads is to follow someone who knows the road and has carbon rims. You'll be able to hear them braking and you'll be surprised how much faster you can go!"
How can I charge my phone while cycling?,Three options that I know of:
How precise do spoke sizes need to be?,"This topic is really poorly understood. Anyone who ever who tells you it's fine to just round up or round off when choosing spoke lengths hasn't been through the disaster scenarios that can be caused by it, or perhaps doesn't remember because the experience is too painful and embarrassing. Rounding up can cause you to run out of threaded length before the spokes are fully tensioned. Always round down unless you can test and measure the spokes in question before building to avoid running out of threaded length or poking the tube. If you have to order spokes, just round down. If your calculated optimal length is accurate (and there's no reason it shouldn't be) and you must round down to the next even number from there (as in the 292 in your example), nothing meaningful will ever be lost in terms of durability from that extra 1.99mm max. What gets overlooked in this discussion is that there are whole brands/models of spoke, or spoke/nipple combinations, that offer zero ability for the spoke to protrude past the top of the nipple. They don't have the threaded length to do it. So rounding up walks you right into the failure situation of running out of thread and having to either start over or accept an untrueable wheel with bad tension. Various Wheelsmith bags I've used, for example, have been like this, with Wheelsmith nipples. Contemporary DT Champions and Competitions, the most commonly encountered premium spokes, avoid this occurrence by having some superfluous/generous threaded length. Some other spoke brands and models do not, and give you no leeway for the spoke to be long. And single wall builds naturally have no such leeway. Some point out that having aluminum nipples miss more than 1mm or so of engagement introduces some risk of the nipple breaking. That's probably true and I recommend shooting for the best possible thread engagement on aluminum nipples, which for practical purposes on conventional nipples is between the base of the screwdriver slot and the top. However, you'll never know if that's what caused it, because al nipples break anyway, especially for 2mm spoke ends. (Al nipples for 1.8s are far less prone to breaking because of the extra material.) Your calculation must be accurate. You don't want to miss more thread engagement than around 2mm from perfect. Never use a calculator where you can't verify that the math it's doing is the pure classic spoke length formula. Some calculators try to invisibly factor in estimates of spoke stretch and rim compression, which you should do manually based on the parts you're using. (Spoke gauges differ in stretch, the amount of tension also causes it to differ, and the stoutness/cross-sectional area of rims make them differ in compression.) Because it's an Excel spreadsheet and all its formulas are right out in the open, Spocalc is my preference. And always measure the hub and rim yourself. It seems pedantic, but I promise that if you build enough wheels, or are ever working for a wheel producer and are tasked with doing spoke calculations and there's never time to do test runs of anything (this was my situation that taught me good spoke calculation habits), you'll find all this necessary to have consistently good results. If you have to order the hub/rim along with the spokes (particularly the rim, because manufacturer list measurements for hubs are usually very accurate), just take vendor/manufacturer listed measurements on faith for calculation purposes, but measure yourself once you do have everything to make sure what you're about to do is going to work. Second-guess published ERDs early and often. Wheelbuilding texts almost never remember to tell you that longer length nipples usually have more threads, and you need to compensate for this to avoid bottoming out the threads on the spoke. Most handbuilt wheels are done with 12mm nipples, but if you ever use 14s or especially 16s, you'll find the rim's ERD is effectively a few millimeters smaller. Or, in other words, ERD is usually calculated as the diameter of the circle formed by the tip of the spokes in a state of optimal thread engagement. Usually that's synonymous with the tip of the spoke being just about flush with the top of the nipple, somewhere between the bottom of the screwdriver slot and the top. 12mm nipples can all handle that, but most of the time if you thread an aftermarket/handbuilding-worthy/premium (however you want to say it) spoke into a 16, you'll find it runs out of thread and bottoms out before it reaches the top. If you do need to round up, or insist on getting full thread engagement, always test it out first by taking a nipple and spoke that you're about to use and see how far the nipple screws on before it bottoms out, and then measure the amount of protruding spoke you have to work with to make sure it will be acceptable with whatever your calculated length was. Also make sure the rim's depth is such that it won't cause spoke to protrude up and poke the rim strip/tube. If the spoke meets these criteria it's fine, but it can't just be assumed that it will until you test. Do that test on enough spokes and you'll see."
'safety dot' on rims,"As long as you can see the dimple, the rim is still thick enough. When you brake, the rim gets worn. Eventually it is worn so thin that it can break. The dimples help you identify the wear so that you can replace the rim before it breaks."
What gloves work well for winter riding?,"Bike-specific full-finger gloves are generally going to give you more dexterity, allowing you finer control over shifters and brake levers. They'll also have padding in the places you need it when riding. However, very few of these gloves will be warm enough for winter riding.  The best solution I've found is to ride with a few layers of gloves, using full-finger gloves as the outer layer and thin gloves as the inner layers. On longer rides, you may need to pack several pairs of gloves and switch off as you need to warm up and cool down.  Wind is your biggest enemy when riding in the cold, and your fingers will get cold. Options to prevent this include thicker gloves (like ski gloves), although these will make your hands clumsier; and lobster-claw gloves, which keep groups of fingers together. (Essentially, these are mittens with a split making you look like a Vulcan about to tell someone to ""live long and prosper"".) I haven't had to get one of those - yet.  Here's what I use, and why:   (click this image for a larger version) Upper left: Regular cycling gloves I'll use these, usually with glove liners underneath, when riding in slightly warmer winter weather.  Upper right: Glove liners These are about the thickness of denim, but can be rolled up like a small pair of socks. I usually take them along for that reason along, but they serve well under regular cycling gloves or even full-finger gloves.  Lower left: Full-finger cycling gloves I used to bring bulky ski gloves along before I got these. The full-finger cycling gloves  I have are made by Gore, and are super-warm (more so than those bulky ski gloves) and water-repellent. It's a bit of a squeeze to fit liners under them, but it works well. The disadvantage of these gloves is that I can't work my GPS or phone easily with these on. They're also overkill when I'm not riding, or if I'm riding slowly.  Lower right: Conventional winter gloves These are good for off the bike on a tour, or when the Gore gloves are too warm but the liners/half-finger gloves are too cold. These are also excellent for snowball fights. "
How to tighten a brake?,"There are two basic adjustments that apply to all types of rim brakes (v-brakes, cantilevers, calipers): Tension:
The cable tension from the brake lever to the brakes adjusts how responsive your brakes feel.  Tighten it up and both brake pads will engage sooner and the braking action will be harder.  Loosen it up and braking will feel spongy and you may not get enough power.  Normally you want to add tension; removing tension is only done when you put on fresh pads or if you set the tension too tight.  Adding tension periodically is important since your pads wear down over time and the cable stretches a bit too. The easiest way to adjust the tension is to use a barrel adjuster: they're usually on the brake lever or the brake or both if you're lucky.  Add tension by turning the adjuster counter-clockwise (looking at it from the side where the cable housing goes in). But whenever you adjust tension, you need to fix... Balance:
This controls how far each pad is from the rim.  Adding tension will pull both pads closer to the rim, but usually one will move more than the other.  So by adjusting balance you can move the closer one further away and the other pad will do the opposite.  You want to balance the pads so that they're about the same distance from the rim and engage at about the same time.  If it's skewed (like your brakes) then you won't get as much braking power. For v-brakes and canti's there's a spring inside each brake arm.  You can adjust the spring force by turning a small set screw on the side of the brake arm.  Screwing it in (clockwise) will pull the arm away from the rim (which pulls the other one closer).  It's best to adjust the two arms together:  screw in the closer arm first by half a turn to start, and screw out the other one by the same amount.  Check the balance and then repeat as necessary. For caliper brakes (road bikes) there's normally just one set screw to adjust.  Turn it to see which way the brakes move."
DIY Painting a Bike Frame: Is it possible?,"I'm not an expert on this, but I do have a friend who immaculately restores vintage bicycles. I've helped him on a few projects and this is roughly what he does. (My friend started out 5 or 6 years ago with an old cruiser and cans of spray paint. Wound up becoming obsessed and ended up with a spray painting set-up that he found on Craigslist...) Basically he starts with your steps 1 - 4 for paint removal, although more advanced. My friend has professional grade spray painting equipment and uses industrial grade coatings, so he's not using rattle cans of spray paint. If you're serious about it, I can find out what brands, etc he uses. And for powder-coating, another acquaintance recently spent ~ $200 USD on a frame. Yeah, totally possible However, sending your bike frame off to the paint shop for powder-coating ceases to be DIY. ;~)"

Do helmets really lose their quality with time even if kept in package?,"A lot will depend on the construction of the helmet. For example the basic material in the helmet will be some sort of sponge or foam which relies on its texture to absorb sudden impacts; does this degrade over time? For example, a loaf of bread gets its texture from the tiny air bubbles formed while rising and proving, but if left to prove too long, the structure collapses, or, once baked, the bread will harden and not be as flexible.  So it might be with helmet foam; at least, that's the concern, in particular when subjected to sustained UV/sun light. It's certainly not been a concern that manufacturers have been quick to dispel.  But there is another side to this question, not just whether you should not buy an older helmet because it has lost its ability to do its job? Have the helmet construction methods moved on since that helmet was made, simply, are newer helmets better? Are they lighter, stronger, more absorbent, better value, more adjustable?  Many reputable organisations, e.g. the Bicycle Helmet Safety Institute, say not to worry Most manufacturers now recommend that helmets be replaced after five years, but some of that may be just marketing. (Bell now recommends every three years, which seems to us too short. They base it partially on updating your helmet technology, but they have not been improving their helmets that much over three year periods, and we consider some of their helmets since the late 1990's to be a step backwards, so we would take that with a grain of salt.) Deterioration depends on usage, care, and abuse. But if you ride thousands of miles every year, five years may be a realistic estimate of helmet life. And helmets have actually been improving enough over time to make it a reasonable bet that you can find a better one than you did five years ago. It may fit better, look better, and in some cases may even be more protective. The Snell foundation concurs:  Hair oils, body fluids and cosmetics, as well as normal ""wear and tear"" all contribute to helmet degradation. Although I would hesitate to buy a helmet which can't stand up to sweat, this suggests that it is use that affects the longevity of the item, not its storage.  I'm not a scientist in this area, but while there might be evolutionary reasons in the helmet's construction to merit buying newer ones, just being stored for a few years probably won't be reason enough.  But as I asked in an answer to a related question, why are you planning on wearing it? If you're looking for a cheap helmet because you don't really want to wear it, then an old one will be fine, but if you're genuinely concerned for your safety and you really want something to do the best job, then should you be quibbling over the few dollars/pounds/{currency units} difference? "
Should inner tube have excess length?,"A tube should not have excess length, and doubling on itself will cause the tire to feel uneven while riding, as well as increase the likelihood of flats. Assuming the tube is the correct size for the tire, as you said it was, there are 2 common causes for this problem. If you installed the tube without inflating it first, just a tiny amount, then it hasn't got the shape to sit in the tire completely, and it will appear to be too long. It isn't, just add enough air to the tube to give it a little shape and try it again. If you did that already, then in the process of inflating the tube to make easier to install in the tire, you have probably inflated it too much, and so it has gotten larger. It's not permanent, just let the air out and inflate it only enough to give it shape before installing it in the tire. If these don't work, there is likely a problem in manufacturing, and you should get the tube exchanged. Hope that helps."
How do I reduce slack in the chain of a single-speed bicycle?,"If you have horizontal dropouts (the wheel axle slides into the frame from the back of the bike) the dropouts have long slots which will allow you to pull the rear wheel back and take slack from the chain.  Be careful to ensure when you torque the wheel nuts down the wheel doesn't slip from being aligned straight, or the chain is running at a slight angle. If the chain is so stretched to the point where it's falling off, you really should consider replacing the chain.  You can get away with removing a link to remove the slack but a worn chain will be prone to sticky links and popping off unannounced."
How often should hydraulic disk brakes need bleeding?,"In general, hydraulic brakes should only need bleeding when the system has been ""opened up"" for some reason, or when a leak has either allowed air in or allowed enough brake fluid to drain out that the master cylinder is pumping air.  The ""need to bleed"" indicates a problem with the brakes. On autos, hydraulic brakes should be drained and new fluid installed about every 50,000 miles (though this is rarely done).  Comparable mileage on a bike would probably be 5,000-10,000 miles."
Is fluorescent clothing effective?,"There are several terms around this subject. A key thing here is reflectivity (or more specifically retroreflectivity), rather than fluorescence. Fluoresence is the property of a material where it absorbs light at one wavelength, e.g. ultraviolet sunlight, but then reflects back light from the visual spectrum. This is most useful in daylight conditions, using the sunlight to create more human visible light.  Everything (well, almost everything) is reflective to some degree, mostly diffuse reflection where light hits a surface and scatters, but this reflection goes in many directions and breaks apart into many wavelengths. Alternatively there is  a property called retroreflection which reflects light back to its source, in contrast to mirror (or specular) reflection which just bounces off, as light does with a mirror, in a single opposing direction. Hence a person near the light source, e.g. a driver in a car, sees the retroreflective surface.   Thus in terms of visibility, you don't just need flourescent material at night because there isn't enough light in the usable spectrum, so a yellow jacket isn't going to be any more useful than a white t-shirt. So while they'll both be more visible than something black, in order to stand out in a driver's headlights, you need retroreflective material to actively react, rather than passively reflect.  [Possibly related: visibility at night, using electroluminescent wire]"
How bad is cross chaining?,"The problem with cross-chaining is that you put more stress on the chain which causes wear and tear on cassette teeth, eventually leading to the chain slipping gears. The chain line is one factor.  The chain should ideally run in a plane from the front derailleur teeth back to the rear derailleur.  It shouldn't be forced into a line on the teeth, and then angle as soon as it clears the teeth to get to the cassette as happens when cross-chaining because that causes teeth to wear.  You're not going to fix the chain line except by making the chain and gear spacing narrower which requires weaker chains at a given price. The length of the rear derailleur cage determines how much slack it can pick up in the chain.  If you size your chain big-to-big, and have a derailleur capable of picking up the slack then shifting into big-big shouldn't do damage.  Shimano XT rear derailleurs have a 43 tooth capacity which should cover just about anything, but I had a touring bike with a wide range of gears that exhausted it.  I managed to wedge things pretty well when my shifters got pushed into awkward positions on a train and I started riding without checking."
Leave a bicycle in the rain for a day - is it safe?,"It's no problem, but there are a few things to consider: If you ride in the rain, then keep the bike in a shed on a damp day, it won't dry out properly for hours anyway, so the actual outside storage isn't much extra punishment on top of the ride (assuming of course that it's wet all day)"
How much of a difference will I notice going from a Mountain bike to a road bike?,
Is reversing the stem (pointing it backwards) a safe way to reduce reach length?,"No, it would not be particularly safe. The steering would get extremely twitchy and difficult to handle."
Safest way to store bike outside (city),"Not answering your actual question, but this might be useful to you. To get a bike through narrow or awkward spaces, hold the handlebars and pull it up onto its rear wheel so it is pointing straight up. It relatively easy to balance a bike like this and push it around on its rear wheel while holding the handlebars. In this orientation it's about as wide as a person and can be turned in place. It's easy to go down stairs and it's even possible to go up stairs by walking backwards with it. The rear brake can be used to stop it slipping backwards. If you use this technique you may find you are able to more easily get the bike into your apartment, which will be much preferable to locking it up on the street, with respect to both theft or vandalism and the effects of weather. "
Can frequent light bicycle commuting severely damage pants?,"Absolutely. The thicker your thighs, the more friction, and the quicker the pants loose their thread. This happens relatively irrespective of material, even jeans can wear through rather quickly. I guess that specialized bike wear uses materials that are much less prone to this, but I have not tested that myself. Of course, saddles with sharp edges do contribute to the wear. Yet, one pair of pants in a year is not too bad. I've worn down jeans within two or three months, simply by biking a lot more with them than you do."
Why are electric bikes so expensive?,"I have sold a small quantity of electric bicycles over the years (including one to a 83 year old woman). Were these profitable sales, from the bike-shop's point of view? Not really...    Frame + Extras Cost is different to price, clearly the bicycle costs more to build, e.g. in Giant's top-class Taiwan factory on a relatively limited production run. As mentioned in other answers, there is the motor, the batteries and control gear. On top of that there is also a more expensive frame. The frame has more 'braze-ons' to mount the electric running gear. It is also extra tough so that the frame and fork can survive (force = mass x acceleration and an electric bike goes quicker with extra mass). This frame/fork combination is also unique to the electric models whereas, on a normal bike, the frame may be shared across a model range.
As well as the frame/fork being different, the wheels and tyres are up-rated, this may not actually cost that much more rubber and aluminium, however, these parts are model specific, limited run for the manufacturer, possibly specially made by the suppliers.
As of yet there are no electric bikes that make use of the frame to carry the battery, typically this has to have a rack and extra packaging to attach it to the bicycle. These parts cost money, again they are also bespoke.
The batteries can use Lithium, NiMh or even lead-acid, clearly with cost differentiation, the Lithium cells costing more.   As of yet we have not left the factory with our electric bicycle, the extra parts and Far Eastern labour may not actually amount to a lot in absolute terms, however the factory-cost will be a significant multiple of the regular mass-market mountain/hybrid bicycle cost. The parts cost more as does the assembly line.  Shipping: Weight and size When we come to ship the electric bicycle half-way around the world, there is approximately twice the cost, whether the shipping is priced by weight or volume. This is because the electric bicycle weighs more and needs a much bigger box (compared to a typical MTB that ships with the bars/front-wheel/seat/pedals removed and no mudguards). Interestingly there is less EU 'anti-dumping' duty on electric bikes than normal ones, so no added cost there (and if you wondered why some bikes come from Macau you now know...). Some money does have to be paid to get the boxes out of Felixstowe, on the back of the lorry and up to the warehouse, again this is slightly more than the regular MTB or hybrid, but not massively so.   Warehousing margins Now, this is where the costs get interesting. The bike arrives at the wholesaler or distributor and gets put into a warehouse until a retailer orders it. The wholesaler has price tiers for their 'B2B' customers (the shops) and these will be different depending on sales volumes, e.g. the big chain will get an extra 10-20% off the 'trade price' compared to the family-run lower volume shop. Because the product has a list price then this discount is unlikely to be passed on to the end customer, however, it does give the volume retailer that bit more room come end-of-season sales.   Notionally the wholesaler/importer/distributor is just importing boxes, putting them in a warehouse and sending them out again. In an ideal world they would charge just a flat fee for this, however, the more expensive boxes tie up more capital, they also tend to linger in the warehouse longer. This means they cannot be marked up by the wholesaler with a 'per box' price. Typically a standard margin is applied to the products, exactly what this margin is may seem high to someone outside of the trade, however, the tax man has a slice of that and some of that margin may be swallowed up by currency fluctuations.   Expensive, Niche Product When the retailer buys the electric from the company owning the big warehouse they may be buying just the one - most bicycle shops cannot afford the showroom space or the capital cost to have a range of electric bicycles. For this reason it is unlikely that a good deal is done due to bulk purchasing. The delivery to the bike shop may be relatively expensive too - delivery with all couriers in the UK is by weight. So we have double the cost on this leg of the journey when compared to the regular bike.   The retailer has what seems a good bit of money to make on the electric bicycle. However, walk-in customers have not arrived for an electric bike, they are there for normal bikes. They may not even be aware that electric bikes are on offer too. Walk-ins just don't ask for an electric bike - customers wanting touring bikes or tandems are rare, customers wanting electric bikes are rarer too for the regular bicycle shop. To change this situation requires promotion, i.e. advertising, a window display and sales staff training. With the exception of retailers that have gone out of their way to push electric bike sales, this does not happen.   Training / Support As well as the sales staff having to be able to know how to sell an electric bike the mechanics in the back room have to know how to make them showroom ready. Then, should a sale come along, the bike has to be checked to make it safe. Additionally, the bike will collect quite a bit of dust waiting for a customer and be subjected to test rides by potential customers. This total time will be a lot more than with the regular bike because the electric bike is not so familiar to the workshop team. It is unlikely that this time is costed, however, it all adds up. Hence the eventual sale is unlikely to be discounted (unless the shop is small and desperate for some extra cashflow that week or the model is end of season and needs to be shifted). The taxman also takes his cut, 20% VAT is not a lot of money if buying a 'Bicycle Shaped Object' (cheap bike), but is a lot of money if buying an electric bicycle.   Margin Pricing If we work through the above steps starting with one small component, e.g. a washer that costs a penny. Its cost could be ten pence by the time it has been fitted onto the bike, maybe up to twenty pence to get to the warehouse in Milton Keynes. Because of how margin costing works, the washer could then cost forty pence by the time it gets to the showroom. On the face of it, it seems ludicrous that a penny washer now costs forty times as much, however, along the way nobody has been greedy (maybe with the exception of the taxman, but that is government protection rackets for you - lots of wars to pay for).   Although the maths has been simplified with the 'washer' example, costs go up from component supplier to the cycle manufacturer to the distributor and to the dealer with the maths being multiplication (by a margin) rather than addition (of a handling fee) at most steps. That is how it works.   Clearly, to save costs a cheaper washer could be used - one that costs the factory 0.5 pence - and it could be fitted to the bike by someone in mainland China costing less than the Taiwanese worker. The factory too could be cheaper - with less capital tied up in the building/land. This 'cheaper and nastier' product could then enter the supply chain to be marked up with margins at the importer-distributor-wholesaler-retailer steps. Given that the product is not really one that anyone really wants, some incentives exist in the supply chain, e.g. higher margin for the retailer. Hence the 'cheap' electric bike - as sold by certain High Street chains - might be a complete rip-off with the worst components and the fattest of profits for someone in the chain.     You might suspect that parts and training would factor into the costs, but it does not do so directly. Sales and workshop staff in the bike shop are unlikely to have had any training on how to look after customers for electric bikes. The spare parts are not likely to be kept in the cycle shop - these will be special order from the wholesaler. The wholesaler will be able to sell these spares profitably and - if they know what they are doing - keep sufficient spare parts stocked appropriate for demand.   The price is Actually Reasonable We are a long way off monopoly pricing with electric (and normal) bicycles, due to competition in the marketplace the pricing is nearer 'cost + acceptable profit' rather than 'what the market will tolerate'. Electric bikes are not expensive per se. With the exception of walking (and maybe container freight) there is no cheaper transportation going. Arguably normal pedal cycling is more expensive than electric bike cycling, however, this depends on how you value your time. Electricity to charge and electric bike costs less than a Mars Bar (or other calorific food equivalent).   In the showroom electric bikes are somewhat clunky feeling, but once you go on the road with them and put the motor on the bike feels as light as a feather, particularly up hills.   My advice for getting an electric bike cheaply is to do so through government 'bike to work' scheme. This is where your employer buys the bike and gets the tax back. Effectively you get the bike at 50% retail price, with actual ownership of the bike being between you and your employer. Typically they let you have it."
Tyre exploded while riding,"TLDR answer: you ran over something Given the ding/cut in the rim itself that aligns with the cut in the tire, you ran over something metal that was sharp enough to cut your tire and even dig into your rim a bit. That looks like a deep carbon fiber rim - if so, I'd recommend doing a better job watching what you're riding over because the next bit of debris might be enough to seriously damage your rim - which will be expensive to replace if it is a deep carbon rim. Nevermind that getting a flat tire in any circumstance can be dangerous if it happens at any decent speed."
Why should little kids not have back mirrors on their bicycles?,"Literally, TMI [too much information]. Kids shouldn't have to deal with what's behind them.  When learning to ride, they have the dual challenge of learning bike-control and balancing as well as not running into things. Expecting them to look behind without falling over is just too much information for them to process. A second downside is that kids do fall over.  Having a spike on the bars could be a bad thing - there have been fatalities from being impaled on the end of handlebars. Kids should not be on the road at that age, so rear spatial awareness is less important."
Protecting bike attachments such as lights against theft,"Take the lights and anything else thats likely to be stolen off your bike.  For things that can't be removed easily, you may want to use something like Pitlock security skewers (or security bolts) or glue in ball bearings or similar into the head of the bolts (which will make them hard to remove when you need to remove them, but a casual thief can't remove them easily). Also, make sure you know how to properly lock up your bike (which has been discussed at length in other places on this SE). "
One vs. Two wheeled bike trailers,"One-wheeled trailers are more agile and don't increase the width of your bike.  They lean with the bike. If you're going to go really narrow places, you need one-wheel. Two-wheeled trailers can generally carry more weight and are less prone to making the bike fall over when you stop. So, what are you going to do with the trailer?  Going up and down mountains with narrow trails: get a one-wheeled trailer. Carrying 50kg of equipment from the hardware store home using streets and wide paths: get a two-wheeled trailer."
How dangerous are my worn rims?,"Rims are worn out when the groove disappears. If the groove is clearly visible, well-defined and of uniform depth all the way around, the rim is not quite worn out and certainly not dangerous. New brake blocks will cause less wear as they will be free of hard particles of grit and metal that get embedded in the relatively soft rubber over time. Given the repair shop's bad advice on the state of the rims and refusal to replace the blocks, I'd disregard all of their other advice about needed repairs. I suspect they just saw a well-used bike and decided they could persuade you to purchase a new one. Find a repair shop with a better reputation and get a second opinion. Replacing and adjusting brake blocks yourself is relatively easy if you have basic tools. Park Tool has an excellent web page and collection of videos that walk you through the process."
Purpose of 'bore' on spoke nipples - why are spoke nipples not threaded through their entire length?,"Adding threads to any sort of bolt under tension doesn't actually make it much stronger, beyond the first ≈5 threads. Adding more basically just adds dead mass; either way the whole thing will generally fail somewhere close to the first thread. So, filling the bore with threads wouldn't have any benefit. What it would do however is move the expected point of failure out of the relative safety of the unthreaded bore, which particularly protects the spoke from being bent at that point, which would further diminish its strength. The bore makes it so that if there's some bending, it will be on the unthreaded part of the spoke, which is stronger to begin with, so not as worrisome."
Is there something particularly wrong with exclusively riding a mountain bike in a city setting?,"The question of big box bike quality to one side, the question should be not whether it's ""appropriate"" to ride this bike, but whether you like it.  Are you physically comfortable riding the bike? If so, great! If not, there are several questions here about bike fit that may help you get comfortable on the bike. A bike that doesn't fit you will never be a good bike for you.  Is the new bike reliable and in good shape? Things to check: Do the brakes work reliably? Does the bike shift well? If not, bring it to a bike shop and have a mechanic look at it.  Mountain bikes are great at navigating potholes and are good city bikes because they accelerate quickly. (That last is great for when the traffic light turns green - zoom!) They're also easy to outfit for snow and ice.  If you're concerned with other cyclists' thoughts on what's ""appropriate""... well, that's their problem and not yours at all. If you like the bike, I suggest you ride it and enjoy it. "
"14 ""Trashed"" bikes acquired for free. Worth repairing and reselling? What do I look for?","From having maintained cheap bikes using other bikes as parts donors, even dismantling some to provide parts for others you're likely to need to buy some bits like chains and cables. They're cheap but will eat into your profit. It might be a good idea to prioritise those with slightly better names but low enough specifications to use cheap parts from the cheaper bikes. If you have time, space, and tools, and need the money and practice, it's a good opportunity but probably not a lucrative one. Consider how you'd feel if you sold half of them, for the low end of your estimate, after putting in a fair bit of effort and a little bit of money on parts. I think that's a realistic yield. Luckily you can do one at a time and see how it goes. People do do this to make money.  "
Is there a way to know if someone is drafting behind without turning your head back or trying to hear the noises?,"A group riding together and cooperating will ride to a set speed, so you'll be surging if you exceed that speed for long.   A simple wheel-magnet speedo and bike computer helps show this on your bars without being big or expensive. An ad-hoc group will ride with varying speeds depending on who's in the front and whether they are trying to make a break away or if they're just sick of waiting for the rest of the group to cycle through the paceline.  Some riders need short pulls and some can cope with long pulls at the front.  Separately some people need short rests out of the wind, and some people require quite long periods behind someone else to regain their pace.    The best groups work together for the end goal which is a good training ride. In racing, your team is your group and the other teams are NOT your friends so they're working for themselves.  A race peloton is therefore an adhoc group of teams who are not working together. If you face some decent climbs in your route, then groups tend to fall apart as everyone climbs at their own pace.  For training and bunch rides, stop at the top and let everyone get there, then rest till the last arrival is ready to carry on. Otherwise the first arrivals are rested while the last people are shattered and the group breaks up or is held back. Same goes for downhill - strava segments work on segment time, not first-down time :) More thoughts - A shoulder check every half minute should show you if the rest of the paceline is there still. If you don't have a speedo, riding to a set cadence might be enough.  Try and memorise the speed of your feet while in the paceline, and simply maintain that rhythm when you hit the front of the line.  Sing a song in your head of the right speed, or count off like marching if that works for you. Getting expensive - there are race-radios like the pros wear.  They are essentially Personal Shortrange UHF radios with an earpiece and a small transceiver in a pocket.  The aerial/headphone cable runs up the back and is often taped on.  Some new ones are small enough to work with the helmet.  These talk to each other in the team and to team car, who then relays messages onwards with a second radio or maybe a cellular phone.   Some are even bluetooth based and just associate with one~four other units.   Motorcycle riders might wear these under their full face helmets."
What is the maximum number of pucture repairs an inner tube can take?,"When the patches start to overlap, or you are fixing old patches that have failed, it is time to get a new tube."
How can I tell what year my bike was made?,"Serial Numbers Bicycles (except children's bicycles) are almost always required to have a frame or serial number. Some manufacturers use a date-code as part of the serial number.  For example, a Brompton uses YYMMXXX as their serial code, so a
  Brompton with a serial number of 1306123456 was manufactured in 2013.06
  or June 2013 Surly is another manufacturer who uses date codes, this time in their stamped frame numbers.  Manufacturers who don't use date codes However, many bicycle manufacturers don't use date codes and so you can't easily decode their serial numbers. Some of these manufacturers will provide their own serial number lookups on their websites. Some of the other ones have been reverse-engineered by their rider communities. The best way to find out is to google ""manufacturername bicycle serial number date of manufacturer.""  See also the Mongoose answer is below . "
Larger tires on a road bike,"Road frames come in a wide variety of styles, so it's impossible to give an exact answer without knowing more about your bike.  Also keep in mind that wider tires also have a larger diameter, so your bike has to have enough clearance for both. A typical modern road bike with caliper brakes is going to have very tight tolerances: many will max out at a 28mm tire, some at only 25mm.    When mine was built, I had the frame customized and used long reach brakes just to allow 28mm tires plus fenders -- even then it's a tight fit.  Another problem with calipers and wide tires is that you may not have enough brake cable slack to remove the wheel easily (I have to deflate mine slightly to get the tire past the brake shoes). Touring and cyclocross frames tend to be built with much more generous proportions and have room for bigger tires.  Using cantilever brakes also helps give much more tire clearance vs. calipers.  My last touring frame used 32mm tires and could have easily gone up to at least 35mm, if not bigger. If you're putting on much larger tires, you should also consider larger rims (see Sheldon Brown's tire/rim sizing chart).  Using a big tire on too small a rim is a recipe for trouble.  Plus a wider rim adds more strength.  So you may need a wheel rebuild to make this happen."
What should I do with stop lights which don't detect my bike? [Ontario],"These situations are frustrating. This site (Ontario bike laws) explicitly states the ""Idaho stop""  (Cyclists must stop on a red light, but can then proceed yielding to all traffic) is illegal.  This leaves you few options other than to dismount and use the pedestrian crossing. If you know the phasing will go green as it cycles though after a pedestrian button is pressed, you could then remount and wait for the green light. Of course the non-legal way may be more pragmatic if traffic is very quite and it is safe to continue though the intersection. A defense that the lights were failing to work correctly by not sensing a bicycle may work, provided you were stopped for a period of time and could prove it. Long term, you could lobby the local authorities (with the support of a local bicycle group)  to have the light controls upgraded to sense cyclists, or introduce the Idaho stop law. For US based readers, I found this site  with a map of states and their bicycle stop laws (note: Quite old, 2014 - check for updates for specific states.)"
"Stuck pedal, I've tried everything","I think your pedal is a lost cause.  Even if you did get it off in the current condition, reinstalling and later removal will make later-you hate current-you. I would disassemble the pedal from the outside - remove the axle cap, locknut, cone, and bearings, then slide the pedal cage outboard.  You may have a second set of bearings inboard, or a bushing.  The bearings are probably separate, but might be caged.  These are all ""spare parts"" now. Now you should have a bare metal shaft poking out the side of your bike crankarm.  It will be hardened metal, and probably chromed and oily.   I would use a grinder or a file to create two flat(ish) spots on either side of the widest part of your axle.  Don't need to be perfect, need to provide a place for grip. Then I would use either a pair of stilsons (aka a pipe wrench or monkey wrench) or I'd put the bike horizontally with that axle pointing down into a secured bench vise.  At that point you should be able to use excessive leverage to back out the axle. Think three times about which way you need to turn the axle.  It should be left-hand thread but that flips if you're working from the back-side.  Its easy to be tightening when you want to be loosening. Once its out, examine both the internal and external threads.  Identify why it was so wedged, and whether there is damage inside the crank.  If you have a 9/16"" 20tpi left hand tap then chasing the thread gently would be a good idea.  If the thread is munched, then consider options. Finally, go shopping for new pedals.  Whether you want to stay with flats or go to clipless/cleats etc. When you do install replacement pedals, use something as an assembly lubricant.  Grease at a minimum and is better than nothing."
"When accompanying children on roads - ahead, beside or behind?",For safety reasons I prefer to be behind them. That way I can position myself on the road slightly further out then they are. This forces any overtaking vehicles to negotiate past me first and makes them provide a little more breathing space for my child in front. It certainly seems to prevent them trying to squeeze past.
Why would a tire be for trainer use *only*?,"Turbo trainers are notorious for quickly wearing out tires. Trainer tires are therefore made of a hard wearing compound. However, this compound may not provide enough traction for safe cycling. Traction is immensely important as it is usually the limiting factor to the maximum speed in curves. If one's rear wheel slides away while cornering recovery is usually not possible. See also the related question: What kind of tire should I purchase for use on a bike trainer?"
Why do my disc brakes squeal when wet?,"They squeal because water acts as a mild lubricant. That's why things are ""slippery when wet"" ;)
The water makes it harder for the pads to grab onto the rotors. They'll grab for a small fraction of a second and then let go again, and they do this really fast. Imagine the squeaky sound that a your finger makes when your run it over a smooth wet surface, or the sound your shoes make on a tile floor when you just came in out of the rain. Same sort of thing, only constant.
With bike brakes and disc brakes especially, the braking surface (the rotors for disc brakes, the rim for rim brakes) will find a harmonic resonance and thus the really loud tonal squeal.
All brakes have the potential to squeal, especially when wet. I wouldn't worry much about it unless you find that your braking power is being significantly reduced. In such a case, try some different compound pads. Metallic pads are generally considered to be superior in adverse conditions but they're also loud as hell in the rain/mud.

How many years an aluminium frame lasts in a touring bike?,"There are a lot of question so I will settle on the one in the title.   How many years will an current aluminum frame last of a touring bike?   Depends: Aluminum has not changed in the 10 years  All we know is your last aluminum, high quality, strong frame bike lasted about 10 years    The best guess is your next aluminum, high quality, strong frame will also last 10 years
Really that is the best guess   That is as vague as how long will a current pair of sneakers last me?
And the best guess for how long my next pair of sneakers will last is how long did my last pair last.   Aluminum fatigues and steel does not fatigue. 
As stated in a comment steel does fatigue - well not always. Mild steel will not normally admit fatigue crack growth if the applied stresses are below about 10% of the strength of the material. Materials, such as aluminium alloys, do not have any such fatigue limit. If a cyclic load is applied, aluminium alloys will always fatigue.  For the same strength a steel bike is typically going to be heavier than aluminum.  But you get a bike that is much much less susceptible to fatigue.  With steel you also get a bike that will take a ding (dent) and not compromise structural strength to the extent of aluminum. Not exactly the same thing but at the molecular level they are related. Frame Materials  Found a quoted number.  Just because it was on the Internet does not make it right but here is a 5-10 year quote.
Bike Frame: Aluminum Vs. Steel  Aluminum frames possess the shortest fatigue life of any material used
  to manufacture bicycle frames. The typical aluminum frame possesses a
  life expectancy of five to 10 years. The fatigue life of steel is much
  longer, but the material requires more maintenance. To prevent rust
  formation steel frames must be cleaned and polished regularly and
  periodically coated with rust stop on the interior of the frame. If you are discounting steel because it will rust then you are not caring for the bike properly.  A properly maintained and stored steel bike should not rust.  And for sure it should not rust out in your life time.   You stated bikes from you fathers era lasted 40-50 years - pretty sure they were steel bikes. If you want fatigue free and rust free then get titanium.  "
How to get my feet out of SPD pedals?,"Make sure the release tension is low at first (should be a little screw on face of pedal).  Generally you will get to a point of looseness where you are popping out unintentionally, go just tigher than that. Cleat placement also can be a factor.  The closer to the toe it is, the easier it tends to be to get out.  Be careful about moving too far from the balls of your feet, it could end up with achy toes! Lastly, see if the sole of your shoe is interferring with the pedal.  If it is dragging, you can get little spacers that go between sole and cleat. Don't worry about damaging the cleat, you will do more walking around on concrete.  Also, you will probably fall at least once while getting used to them.  It is almost a rite of passage."
Trail shared by bicyclists and hikers,"TLDNR: The MTB was ( I will be polite ) outright rude, ignorant and out of line. Virtually every country has a code of conduct for Mountain bikers, most of these are based on the one the IMBA (International Mountain Bicycling Association) has drawn up. The bikers should have yielded to you unless the local trail has other guidelines. How this related to single direction tracks- Mountain bike tracks are made single direction because the speed of opposing bikers can lead to dangerous a situations and generally riders on bidirectional tracks have to slow down due to the risk of head on.  A walker generally does not carry the speed of a cyclist (steep uphill excluded) but importantly is far more agile in the event an expected encounter.  To make use that agility, the walker need to be aware, as soon as possible, of the oncoming rider, using both eyes and ears. A walker  going in the same direction as the ride cannot use their eyes, so should be walking in the opposite direction of the cyclists. However, as a rule, MTB trails are made single direction as a way to allow them to be ridden faster. Usually these are the more technical down hill sections of trail where the rider is free to focus on the ride, not potential a head on, with easier and uphill trails reserved for bi directional travel. MTBers have become used to the idea that a single direction track is permission to ignore the potential of other trail uses they may have presumed they would not cross paths with another trail user.  This is possibly a flaw in the trail design and should be taken up with the owner/authority in charge of the trail."
Night cycling: Is it worth using electroluminescent wire?,"There is some interesting research from the Australasian College of Road Safety. In amongst some decent comparisons of methodologies, they suggest that reflective material on the major joints makes the real difference in having cyclists being identifiable and identified. The thinking, as I understand it, is that lights are just lights and could be on (more or less) anything, but reflective material on ankles and knees introduces motion and makes you look like a cyclist to a viewer's subconscious. This isn't to say that you shouldn't light yourself up like a Christmas tree, but unusual and unexpected things aren't necessarily going to help you be noticed."
How often should I grease and repack my hubs and bottom bracket?,"Looking at the spec of your bike it says the BB is a cartridge unit. This probably isn't serviceable -- it's designed to be replaced when worn out, so just keep riding it until it grinds or gets excessively sloppy. The hubs might be serviceable. If you ride a lot in nasty conditions, or you're aggressive with the degreaser you might want to service them. However, if they're well-sealed (like most modern hubs and in particular Shimano hubs) then they almost never need servicing. If you're worried, learn how to service them yourself and see what they look like. If they're still packed with grease and nice and clean inside they don't need servicing. Servicing them isn't hard but it's a bit fiddly -- you'll lose a bearing under the fridge, then you won't be able to remember if there should be 9 or 10 balls, and whether they're 3/32"" or 1/8"" or 5/32"", and so on. Don't do it for fun. I ride a lot. My Campagnolo Neutrons have probably seen 10,000+ km. In that time I've had a look at the bearings once or twice. Still greasy, still smooth. The rims will wear out before the hub bearings do."
"Why are bicycle tires incapable of maintaining pressure over time, while car tyres seem to have less of a problem?","A car tyre has much thicker rubber than a tubeless bike tyre, thicker still than a tube. The steel wires in the belts of a car tyre are impermeable to gas and occupy a significant fraction of the area of that layer.  So there is a material difference.  In both cases the rim can be regarded as impermeable, and the sidewall more permeable than the tread. Car tyres, despite their much squarer cross-section, have a larger ratio of volume to surface area.  The volume determines the remaining pressure, while the surface area determines the leak rate. Even taking that into account, car tyres don't really hold enough air for a year.  The fact that they may give acceptable handling for months on end has a lot to do with how forgiving driving a car can be compared to running on two wheels.  Try asking a motorcyclist (dimensions and construction close to car tyres) how often they top up the air.  But still, a few months should be OK on a car, though topping up once a month should improve your fuel consumption. I don't run tubeless, so the following assumes tubes.  My tourer and hybrid, pumped to the max pressure, gives an acceptable ride for about 3 weeks on ~32mm tyres with cheap tubes.  That's starting from nearly 6 bar (85 psi) so over twice what most cars take.  My MTB doesn't get ridden much at the moment, but again with cheap tubes (though obviously fatter) can hold trail pressures for a little longer than that.  In practice I pump it up almost every use, because I tend to ride on road to the trails then let out some air."
Should I put my wider tire in front or in back?,"Generally on a road bike it is considered better to run tires of equal size. There are a few newer tires which are designed to run different sizes front and rear, but they are usually within 2 mm of each other. (Like the Continental Attack/Force combination) I would consider a jump from 28c to 23c somewhat large. That said, run the larger on the rear. The higher air volume will make for a more comfortable ride, and the narrower front tire will steer quicker, which makes for more reactive handling, and has a better aero profile, (which may or may not matter to you). The comfort part will matter though, and I'd say that's a trump card."
How can one estimate drag for a bicycle?,"Your question is simple but a full answer is complex. The simplest answer is to point to Part 2 (especially chapter 4) of Wilson and Papadopoulos (2004), or the recent review by Debraux et al. (2011), or the paper by Martin et al. (1998). However, even these papers do not cover approaches that take better advantage of the data available from modern bicycle computers and GPS units. Some background on the power-drag equation will help you understand why there are so many different ways (with accordingly different levels of accuracy, precision, difficulty, and cost) of estimating drag. The equation to convert speed to power is well-understood. Total power demanded has four parts: Of these, the simplest piece is the power needed to overcome changes in elevation. The power needed to account for the change in potential energy, and to overcome changes in speed are straightforward: There is a small part of the KE component due to moment of inertia in the wheels but for bicycles that tends to be small and we often ignore it. However, the equations needed to describe the rolling resistance and aerodynamic resistance are a bit more complicated. The article by Martin et al., cited above, gives more detail but if we can ignore wind then the aerodynamic component simplifies to where rho is the air density in kg/m^3 and CdA is the drag area (""A"" is the frontal area and ""Cd"" is the coefficient of drag; CdA is their product and can be thought of as the ""equivalent"" area of a cube held perpendicular to the direction of the wind with a face of area A). If there is non-zero wind, the aerodynamic component is approximately When there is no wind, airspeed and groundspeed are the same so the equation simplifies to the one above. A headwind increases airspeed above groundspeed while a tailwind decreases airspeed below groundspeed. I say ""approximately"" because these are approximations when the wind comes from directly in front or behind (or is zero); when the wind is off-axis, it affects CdA. Finally, the power needed to overcome rolling resistance (which includes tires, tubes, and bearing friction) is Crr is the coefficient of rolling resistance. Now, if you go to an online calculator like the one at Analyticcycling.com you'll see that you must provide values for rho, Crr, Cd, and A; then, given a particular value of speed and slope, it will calculate power. It's easy to find online calculators for the air density, rho, but much harder to find estimates of Crr and CdA (or separately, Cd and A). The easiest (but most expensive) way to estimate CdA is in a wind tunnel. There, an object is mounted on a scale (basically, a very precise and accurate bathroom scale), wind at a known speed is applied, the air density is measured, and the total force on the object is measured by the scale. Watts are force (in Newtons) * speed (in meters/sec) so force (in Newtons) = watts/air speed = 0.5 * rho * CdA * (airspeed^2). The tunnel operator knows rho, knows airspeed, and the expensive bathroom scale measures the force so you can calculate CdA. Wind tunnel estimates of CdA are considered the gold standard: when performed in a good tunnel with experienced operators, the measurements are precise and repeatable. In practice, if you want to know the Cd separately, you'd measure the frontal area A with a digital camera and compare it to a digital photograph of an object (like a flat square) of known area. As an historical aside, nearly 100 years ago Dubois and Dubois measured frontal area by taking photographs of a person and a reference object, cutting out the photos along the outlines of the object, and then weighing the cut-outs on sensitive scales. However, the resistance in tires, tubes, or bearings are not affected by air speed, so one cannot estimate Crr from wind tunnel data. Tire manufacturers have measured rolling resistance of their tires on large rotating drums but they cannot measure aerodynamic drag. In order to measure both Crr and CdA, you need to find a method that measures both and allows you to differentiate between the two. These methods are indirect field estimation methods and they vary a great deal in their accuracy and precision. Until the last 20 years or so, the most common indirect field method was to coast down a hill of known slope and to measure either maximum speed (also known as terminal velocity) or else the speed when passing a fixed point on the hill. Terminal velocity doesn't let you differentiate between Crr and CdA; however, if one measured speed at a given point and were able to control the ""entry"" speed at the top of the hill, you could then test at different entry speeds and get enough equations to solve for the two unknowns, Crr and CdA. As you might expect, this method was tedious and liable to poor precision. Nonetheless, many ingenious alternatives were explored, including coasting down wind-free corridors or inside large airplane hangars, and measuring speed to relatively high precision using ""electric eyes"" or timing strips. Some of these methods are described in the review by Debraux et al., cited above. With the advent of on-bike power meters, new opportunities emerged to measure aerodynamic and rolling drag. In short, if you could find a flat wind-sheltered road, you would ride at a constant speed or power on the road; then, repeat at a different speed or power. The requirement of ""flat and wind-sheltered at constant speed"" meant that you could ignore the PE and KE components of power and only had to deal with the rolling resistance and aerodynamic components so the overall power equation simplifies to where g is the acceleration due to gravity, 9.8 m/sec^2. The latter formula can be easily estimated by linear reqression where the slope of the equation is related to CdA and the intercept is related to Crr. This is what Martin et al. did; they used an airplane runway, averaged the runs in both directions, and measured barometric pressure, temperature, and humidity to calculate rho, and measured and corrected for wind speed and direction. They found that the CdA estimated by this method agreed to within 1% of the CdA measured in wind tunnels. However, this method requires that the road be flat and that speed (or power) be constant over the length of the test run. A new method for estimating CdA and Crr has been developed that exploits the recording capability of many modern bike computers and bicycle power meters. If one has moment-by-moment recording of speed (and optionally, power) then you can directly measure changes in speed so the KE component of power can be estimated. In addition, if you ride around in a loop, the road need not be flat since you know that upon returning to the start point of the loop the net elevation change will be zero so the net PE component will be zero. This method can be and has been applied to coasting down hills of known net elevation change (that is, you don't need to have constant slope, and if coasting you know the power is zero). Examples of this approach can be found here and here and, when performed carefully have been shown to agree with wind tunnel estimates of CdA to well within 1%. A short video presentation on the method can be found starting at about the 28:00 mark here. A short video of the method in use on a velodrome can be found here"
How do I change a road bike into a commuter bike?,You can probably change the stem to something shorter with more rise and not have anything else to change. This may be enough to relieve the back pressure and the drop bars will give you more hand positions which I've always found easier on my carpal tunnel. Changing the handle bars to flat bars will mean you have to get a set of shifters and brake levers to go with the new handle bar style. I'd also recommend that you get a set of full wrap fenders so you can keep the road spray to a minimum. I'm a designer and programmer so I understand the issues around sitting all day. A better investment may be in your chair at the office and your desk. You're spending way more time sitting there every day than you are on your bike. That is the place that you can most likely get the most benefit by setting it up for a proper ergonomic workspace.
Do cassettes and chains need to be replaced at the same time?,"You may need to change your cassette with your chain due to damage, but only if your bike has missed out on some previous maintenance. If you ride one chain beyond the point of wear, it will damage both cassette and chain rings to different degrees. Your chain is a consumable component on your bike.  For most people, 1200-1500 kilometers on a chain is a safe distance to ride it before it stretches enough to damage the cassette or chain rings. If you treat changing your chain like changing the oil in your car, and just do it based on mileage, regardless of the actual wear on the chain, then you can continue to use the same cassette through (on average) 5 chain swaps. The chain rings, at least a good quality set, are thicker metal, with a larger diameter, so they don't wear as quickly.  Usually, I get 10 chain swaps before I need to change the chain rings.  But they will eventually need to be changed as well. I hope that helps."
What is an asymmetric wheel and why would you use it?,"The ""asymmetric wheel"" terminology is a little misleading. This particular wheel has an asymmetric rim. Any bike with a rear derailer setup will have an asymmetric rear wheel, because the gears take up space. The usual way to handle this is that the spokes on the gear side have less of an angle (closer to vertical) than on the non-gear side. (That is, they have different dish angles) Since an angled spoke also pulls outward slightly and the horizontal forces need to balance, the gear side spokes also have higher tension. That more vertical angle and higher tension makes the gear side weaker. Combined with pedaling force tending to apply more on the gear side, the most common spoke failure is on the gear side of the rear wheel. In other words: the gear side of the rear wheel is the limiting factor in the strength/lightness balance when engineering and building a rear wheel. When a rear rim is asymmetric, what that usually means is that they've moved the line that the spokes all connect into away from the gears. This allows the angle to be slightly further from vertical while forcing the non-gear side a bit closer to vertical. That is, both sides will have closer to the same spoke angle. That means that the tension on both sides can be closer to matching. Having the dish angle and tension closer to matching allows for the hub and spokes to be stronger and/or lighter. (but may require strengthening the rim slightly)"
Touching the front wheel with my foot when turning,"This is a common problem, but really not a big deal. I've usually heard it called ""toe overlap"". I have it on all my bikes. Basically, it's a bit shocking the first time it happens, but you get used to it. It's no big deal. If you're simply aware that it can happen at slow speeds, you'll avoid it easily enough. Since it can only happen at slow speeds, it's not particularly dangerous. It's most common on racing-style road bikes due to their short wheelbase or on smaller frame bikes. Big tires and/or fenders can make it more likely. Big feet and shoes that stick forward of your toes very far also make it more likely. Possible solutions include:"
What is the simplest way to lower the gearing on my touring bike?,"I think everyone has provided some pretty sound advice, especially Daniel Hicks and his recommendation to go with the quickest and cost effective option by replacing your chainrings! With a 130/74 BCD, an ideal setup would be to swap in a 24/36/48 which would give you a great range at a cheap price.    The front derailleur is probably the least necessary component on your bike and, while shifting compatibility is a concern, I would recommend swapping in your new chainrings and setting everything up to test for compatibility before spending more money on a new derailleur. I have used mountain FDs on road triples and road FDs on mountain triples with a variety of indexed and non-indexed shifters and have had very little trouble over the years. Really, the only requirement is ensuring that the front derailleur is a triple and has the correct seat tube diameter/pull direction. (Your cascade of compatibility issues is something I've dealt with, but don't worry! There are lots of manufacturers who design compatibility issues into their gear, but they generally don't cater to the average touring enthusiast.) Since you have an SGS derailleur (long-cage) you shouldn't have any issue with chain slack. For touring, the Deore SGS set up with an 11-32 is a great choice. At most, you may prefer to remove 1 or 2 links just to clean everything up. (I ride in New England on 24/38/48 x 13-32 and even with a full load I maybe walk it once a year). When you start changing components such as your crankset you have to deal with special tools, frame clearance issues, bottom bracket fit, and Q-factor (the horizontal distance between your pedals). Mountain cranks have smaller BCDs but have much wider Q-factors which, for some people, can cause knee and hip irritation (which is exacerbated by long rides and clipless pedals). Long story short, if you are comfortable with your bikes ergonomics on long rides, leave it (or give yourself enough time to work out the bugs before attempting a 2k fully loaded).  Otherwise, take things one step at a time. If smaller chainrings don't give you enough oomph, throw on a new cassette which is quick and has few compatibility issues (12-36 is a common low touring range). More compact road cranks have a 110/74 BCD which won't help you on the low end (though, if your leg length permits a longer crank arm it might provide a very small advantage). Some mountain cranks have BCDs as low as 58mm x 20t, but I suspect that this option may be more trouble than it is worth. Some handy online gear resources include: rivbike.com, velo-orange.com, universalcycles.com, and sheldonbrown.com. A cheaper way to ease the inherent suffering of long, steep climbs would be to trim some bike fat and touring load (a good technical and philosophical resource might be The Ultralight Backpacker by Ryel Kestenbaum or Just Ride by Grant Petersen). Some people might recommend trimming some actual fat, but we live in a world where everyone gets to ride a bike, not just 130 pound-25-year-olds. (No offense to the 25-year-old cyclists out there!)"
Can I use an inner tube that's too narrow for the tyre?,"In my experience smaller ones go in fine and last as per normal (not that I have pushed this to extremes with a 700x20 in a 700x40 but I only have 26x1.5 MTB tubes and they work fine in 26x2.00 tyres). Allegedly putting a smaller tube in the tyre becomes a problem if and when you repair it, the patch doesn't necessarily stretch with the inner tube and it can come off."
At what age/stage should my child be at before I start using a child seat?,"The Bicycle Helmet Safety Institute, the US Consumer Product Safety Commission and the American Academy of Pediatrics agree that: ...children under 1 year of age should not be on bicycles. Children are just learning to sit unsupported at about 9 months of age. Until this age, infants have not developed sufficient bone mass and muscle tone to enable them to sit unsupported with their backs straight. Pediatricians advise against having infants sitting in a slumped or curled position for prolonged periods. This position may even be exacerbated by the added weight of a bicycle helmet on the infant’s head.   In some US jurisdictions it is illegal for children under the age of 1 to be passengers on a bicycles as well."
Why can't a child bike seat be mounted on a carbon frame?,"Carbon tubes tend to be very strong at withstanding forces in the direction they are designed for, but weak at resisting other forces (such as clamping forces compressing the tube), hence why bolts for carbon bars, seat posts etc are usually only torqued to 4-5Nm."
What makes grease appropriate for bikes?,"Phil Wood, the owner of the bicycle tool and components company of the same name, once commented that his number one requirement when he was buying barrels of grease for his company, was that it be the exact same green color shade as the previous batch, so that he didn't get too many phone calls asking what he'd changed. Point is that the ""bike specific"" greases generally aren't.  As far as functional necessities: Not too thin - A thin grease, like Slick Honey, will run very smooth, but only for a very short time. If you want ideal performance, and don't mind overhauling your bike every couple weeks, use this. Not too sticky - Motorcycle/Automotive type bearing grease tends to be very sticky and very thick. They are designed to thin out at higher levels of heat and friction than a bicycle will reach. So it will last a long time, but will feel tight, and add friction to your bearings. Generally, buy a tube of Phil Wood or Park tool grease, and feel free to use anything with a similar purity and consistency in the future. Edit: After reading Matthew's answer on this page, I realized I hadn't pointed out the 2 cases where the grease matters. In the case of Carbon, see here. In the case of Titanium, with any non carbon frame, you must use a copper paste grease, commonly sold as TiPrep. it is messy, annoying, gets all over everything, but it stays put, which no other grease i am aware of does for Ti."
What are the benefits of 700c23 tires?,"WIDER TYRES ARE FASTER Every study on rolling resistance (including ones carried out by the leading tyre manufacturers) demonstrates clearly that wider tyres have LOWER rolling resistance and not just at the same pressure. This is also verified by many people (including myself) who use 25mm-28mm and much wider tyres on a regular basis and will never go back to anything narrower. For vast majority of road cyclists there isn't a single rational reason (other than time trailing) for using 23mm tyres if the same model is available in 25 or 28 or wider width. On some bad roads (e.g. UK) it's actually unwise and dangerous to bounce around on such narrow piece of rubber. There are several reasons why the myth of ""fast"" narrow tyres is still alive and kicking. 23mm is everywhere from the adverts, your local bike shop, cycling club to the TdF.
It's inconceivable for most of people to think that so many people around them could get it so wrong. Most of folks just go with the flow and don't ask questions.  People believe that they can ""feel"" rolling resistance and if narrow tyres are pumped up to its usual 100-120PSI it feels fast. You can't feel rolling resistance but you have to methodologically measure it with a power meter of some sort. Firmness and discomfort doesn't translate to speed, quite the opposite.  It's a common belief that rolling resistance is just a function of 
a contact patch and the lower the contact area the faster the tyre is. The facts are that the shape of a contact patch and volume are more important than the total area. People assume that rolling resistance is just about hysteresis (friction/resistance with the tyre itself) and nothing else. They are unaware of (or ignore) ""suspension losses""
which occur on some less than perfectly smooth roads (most) and are about energy lost on lifting the rider/bike on imperfections of the surface. 
For the same reason but on a much larger scale most of experienced mountain bikers with half brain run their tyres at a low pressure to go faster as even small obstacles (even bumpy field or gravel) are absorbed more effectively with less energy lost. People confuse assumptions and beliefs with hard evidence. How many times you've read/heard: ""Surely there is a reason why 23mm tyres are so popular..."" ""Surely if the pros use 23mm tyres..."" Assumptions don't prove anything. Some people (like one of the posters) have tried wider tyres and they found them slower.
Only comparing identical tyres in different sizes make sense and it's pretty obvious that a 23mm Michelin Pro3 is going to be faster than a 28mm Gatorskin due to a different design. Also the difference in speed that 2-3mm difference offers is most likely very small and can be only measured during repeated tests with a power meter at various pressure levels to find each tyre's sweet spot. Many people have never tried anything wider as their frames/forks don't have enough clearance and more sensible and practical bikes taking wider tyres aren't ""good/fast"" enough for them or don't look right. They've never tried any fast wider tyres like Rivendell Jack Browns 33.3333mm or Schwalbe Kojaks 35mm or some fast 650B tyres. They have never run a pair of custom shaven completely bold 26x2.00 Schwalbe Furious Fred 120TPI 3oog mountain bike tyres on the road. It could be an eye opener. Narrow tyres can be pumped up to higher pressures and higher pressure equals more speed. That's incorrect. As you increase the pressure, rolling resistance is going down but then at a certain point starts climbing sharply due to reduced ability of the tyre to conform to the non-perfect road surface (suspension losses). Even on a track/velodrome you won't benefit from 200PSI.
For every tyre width/volume, road surface and the rider's weight combination there is always an optimal (fastest) pressure. High pressure on its own means absolutely nothing.       The pros use it! 
This the favourite argument of the defenders of status quo. You can't argue with it, can you? Well... the pros ride at completely different speeds and therefore the aero benefits are probably more significant than rolling resistance. An average amateur rider would be naive to worry about the air flow differences between 23-28mm tyres. 
Weight is also crucial as winning the stage / future career can be decided on a single climb. Again people worrying about the weight difference of several grams (rotating or not) may be slightly over-anxious.  The pros used to use 19mm tyres too in the past and now they are very slowly migrating to 25mm tyres. Were they wrong at the time, or are they wrong now or they will be wrong in the future? What if they discover that 28mm is even better? Will everyone be blindly following them? 
The truth is that they are as guilty as you and me of being humans and use stuff that feels right and also aren't immune to peer pressure.  Road cycling community tends to be very traditional, conservative and protective of the status quo as I've experienced on other forums and in real life but for being open-minded and embracing ""new"" things can greatly benefit one's cycling."
How does a bicycle pump *head* work?,"What you have is basically a cylinder of rubber. When you lift the lever, the cylinder is compressed on the circular faces. This results in the sides expansion, which will ""hug"" the valve giving the sealing effect.

"Why doesn't ""butt soreness"" affect serious cyclists?","When seated on the saddle, your weight is primarily supported (or should be) at the ischial tuberosities which are commonly known as the ""sit bones"".  Quoted from Wikipedia:  When sitting, the weight is frequently placed upon the ischial tuberosity.[2] The gluteus maximus covers it in the upright posture, but leaves it free in the seated position. Essentially, there is very little sub-cutaneous fat or muscle tissue covering the sit bones while sitting on a bicycle saddle and thus little ""padding"" between the skin and bone. So, when you go through periods of not riding or are new to riding, that region is not adapted to compression and impact from the saddle. After riding for a while, the bone, tendons, and muscle in that region adapts by strengthening in that region, and no doubt vascular and nerve changes occur as well.  What happens in the case of an inexperienced cyclist or one getting back into cycling, is that micro-damage occurs to the bone, muscle, tendons and other tissue in the area. The micro-damage leads to inflammation and thus pain/soreness. At that point, the the tissues begin to repair and strengthen. The bone is thicker and stronger, the muscles/tendons are stronger, nerves are adapted to the stresses, new blood vessels, etc. Once those tissues have remodeled and healed, there is no more soreness. (Actually, the process can happen again if one goes say, riding for 3 hours to riding for 6 hours, but usually won't be as bad the second time around.)  It's pretty much like any other area of the body that goes through the adaptations from not being exercised to being exercised. So, one gets sore at first, but as muscle/skeletal tissue adapts, one is not sore later on. To some degree, the issue is similar a bruise, but it's much more like the muscular/skeletal adaptations that occurs from exercise. "
what benefits does a road bike give over a regular mountain bike for casual cycling?,I think a road bike gives you better efficiency so you can go further with less energy and do it quicker. This is because they are: You might get:
What is the meaning of 11-32 cassette and 12-25 cassette?,"If you imagine a cassette, will have a bunch of sprockets on it. The current 105 range (which came out last year) will have 11 sprockets, the earlier 105 had 10 sprockets. The notation you've noticed simply means that for one of these cassettes, the smallest sprocket has 11 teeth, the largest has 32 teeth. And the second cassette has smallest sprocket 12 teeth, largest sprocket 25 teeth. So these numbers are basically the ""range"" of gears covered by a cassette. You might imagine that a large range (e.g. 11-32) is good, as it would give you lots of teeth to climb steep hills, but also a small cog which you can use to power downhill. And this is correct, but there is also a flip-side. A larger range of sprockets means that there can sometimes be a jump of a few teeth between each sprocket, which can be less smooth when changing gear. Hence, if you don't actually need the large range, a smaller range would give you a smoother ride. As regards which one you should choose, it's not really down to whether you're a beginner or not, more to do with how good a climber you are. If you feel you might struggle going uphill, a 32-tooth sprocket is probably going to be a good choice for you. The other thing to remember is that, when you're thinking about gears, the cassette is only half of the story, the other half being the cranks. The number of chainrings, and the number of teeth on each chainring, will also affect the gear range and smoothness. But that's probably a different question..."
Mixing different front and rear tires,"It's perfectly okay to run different sizes, brands, and types of tires on the front and rear.  As you note, rears will wear faster due to carrying more of the load.  The grip threshold is largely irrelevant, since the front and rear will be exposed to different forces and grip requirements. The main concern is keeping within the range of a single tube size if possible, since otherwise you'd need to have twice the spares on hand. At the extreme end, there are 69er and 96er mountain bikes that mix and match 29"" (622) and 26"" (559) wheels on the same bike as well as Terry women's bikes with 24"" (520) front wheels and 700c (622) rear.  By necessity those run very different tires front and rear."
Converting bike from rim brakes to disc brakes,"Your frame and fork already have disc tabs, which is the first step.  The second is a disc wheelset, which it does not appear that the stock wheels are.  Disc hubs come in two varieties: the common six-bolt ISO and the proprietary Shimano Centerlock, the former are identifiable by a large six-bolt-hole protrusion on the left (non-drive) side of the bike.  The latter have a rubber cover over a smaller splined mount. Once a new wheelset is selected, you'll need a set of calipers and disc rotors.  The Avid BB7 is a popular mechanical disc caliper, and will work with your existing linear-pull brake levers. Installation is fairly straightforward, but since it involves braking it's worth involving a professional if you're at all in doubt of your mechanical aptitude.  The disc rotors bolt to the wheel, the calipers to the frame.  The old v-brakes are removed.  New cables and housing are routed from the levers to the calipers and the calipers are adjusted. Cost-wise, if you're happy with the bicycle otherwise it's not a poor investment - good wheels and brakes can be moved to future bikes if you later decide to upgrade the frame.  The ideal time would be to consider when the wheels already need to be replaced due to wear, since the new wheelset will represent the majority of the upgrade cost."
How do I bring an old bike up to speed?,"Restoring the bike is a great way understand the bike. My history is similar to yours. Gave up bikes around 10. Wife want to me ride with her. I got a top of the line bike on CG for peanuts. Of course, it was top of the line around the 90s :) Cleaning Start by REALLY cleaning the bike. Simple green and brushes. Don't be afraid to wet the bike. Just avoid the seat if it's leather. And no water inside the tubes. Shifters I'd start replacing the shifters for indexed ones. Getting the same brands will usually work. But will require a lot of research to match them with the rear derailleurs (the gear shifting thing on the back). Another option is to just keep the ones you have (friction shifters) and feel the gears changing. Even with modern bikes, this is still the norm with the front gears, so no harm on going that route also. Plus, restoring and fine tuning the bike your self will make you 'know' how to feel the gears better. UPDATE: I take that back. I kept my friction ones on my bike and rode the wife's bike with cheap indexed ones a few times. the friction are way better. also when the freewheel needed replacement I can get any number of gears I feel like and don't worry :). Indexed ones are better for changing on a whim. but are either freaking expensive or will require constant fiddling. friction are just install and forget. love them. Unless you go expensive indexed. But I'm a cheap bastard. Wheels If it has sealed bearings in the middle of the wheel you are fine. Those last a life time. It's that axle on each wheel. Just turn them. If they keep rotating without rattling noises, you are fine. If they just turn a couple times after you roll them with your hand. You need new ones. Also, if they wobble when you turn them, they need truing. That's the only skill that does not pay off to learn yourself. $15 at a bike shop and the wobble is gone. If they rattle, don't spin, wobble, just get new wheels. Cables Inspect them all. Pull them with your hand via each housing. If there's any drag, try to fix it (I did fix my rear derailleur cable by cutting one broken thread that was pointing outwards and so dragging in the housing. good as new now). If it's a brake cable, spew out the $7 and get a new one with new housings. WD-40 into all cable paths also help. Brakes Begin by checking that they still have plenty of rubber. Also check your wheel rims for damages. You have to loose them and tighten them as close as possible to the rim. in a way that they are slightly curved against the wheel, with the BACK of the brake touching the wheel. the front of the brake is the front of the bike. It should look like: \ || /
You should be able to touch the rim with some <15% of travel of the brake. The rest of the travel should be extra pressure for breaking power. Play around a lot with this. There's several places where you can adjust your brake. Second step is to adjust them in a way that when you press the brakes, both sides touch the wheel at the same time! There's usually a screw on the side to control that. Make sure that NO other cable housing goes UNDER the front brakes cable. And I can't stress this enough: test drive the bike on a straight run EVERY time you adjust them. Mostly now that you are getting to know things. Bearings A bike has serviceable bearings in the cranks and in the freewheel (the thing that rotates the back wheel when you are not pedaling). Usually your freewheel will be dry, cranks are almost always fine. check it by rotating the wheel and leaving the cranks still. If the chain is dragged to the front at slow rotating speeds, you have to grease/change the freewheel. I'd only change if the cogs are worn out. You will need a spanner tool to open those. Derailleurs You will hear about them a lot. It's the pair of gears on the back that change the drive gear on the rear wheel, and the guide on the front that change the drive gear on the cranks. It is the easiest part to restore and adjust. If they do not move sideways when you press with your hands, open them up, clean, and grease the hell out of them. It's easy and was what took less time for me, but everyone will say the opposite. When they are moving easily when you press them, read this parktool's article on how to adjust it. More There's probably more than I can remember now... but all in all it took me around a week and a half. And around $50 in tools/greases/new chains. I didn't have to replace any component or cable yet. And now I love to ride. I go to work every day riding. Now, to fully understand what you are doing, read: The last link will point you to several expensive tools. I only need them to work on the cranks and remove the freewheel (you don't have to remove the freewheel unless you will replace it, I didn't know it back then). I got the tools asking around at work, one guy had a nice kit I could borrow."
Is it harmful for a hydraulic brakes bike to be put upside down,"There are two risks to turning your hydraulic brakes upside-down. The brake system isn't filled to overflowing with hydraulic fluid: there's likely to be a small air bubble. Normally, this sits at the highest point of the system: the oil reservoir at the brake lever. There, it's not compressed by the piston when you brake, so it can't interfere with braking. If you up-end your bike, air bubbles might travel through the system to the brake pads. If they don't manage to make it back up to the reservoir before you want to brake, you might find your brakes are squishier than usual. 15 minutes is perhaps a pessimistic estimate, and it's not that much of a risk unless you get on your bike and right away need to brake very hard. The other potential problem is if the seals in the oil reservoir aren't quite tight. You might not notice in normal use, because they're at the top, but when they're at the bottom of the system, the pressure might let some brake fluid seep out. If you notice this happening, stop turning your bike upside-down, and make sure to check that you still have enough fluid to brake properly. If it keeps happening after you've re-tightened the seal, you may need to change the rubber grommet(s). Often rubber seals are dissolved over time by the oil, and stop doing their job properly. As others have said in the comments, you'd be better off avoiding the need to turn your bike upside-down. Find where the water is getting into the frame and seal any gaps. Some bikes already come with holes in the bottom in case they need to drain, and you might consider adding your own."
How do I use the plastic backing on patches?,"The Rema Tip-Top patches that I use--which sound similar to those which the questioner describes--come with instructions in each plastic box.  The package that I have shows the instructions pictorally in seven steps.   Here is the product that I use:  http://www.artscyclery.com/descpage-79002.html In step 7, the manufacturer distinctly recommends that the user remove the plastic backing.  I usually remove this cellophane backing myself.  It sometimes is a little finnicky--if your patch isn't totally set it will seem to pull up the patch.  Just use your thumb to set the patch more carefully.  In the package's Step 6, the manufacturer uses a totally unidentifiable rectagular object to smooth out the patch before removing the cellophane.  I use my thumb, personally, and it works just fine. If one side of the cellophane won't seem to come off without removing the patch, you didn't put down enough vulcanizing fluid.  Try the other side.  If the patch is reasonably centered, this shouldn't be a problem. The answer about leaching chemicals is news to me--though I admit freely that I never looked farther than the instructions in the box for advice.   Once in a moment of frustration, I left the cellophane on and put it into the tire--no problems so far.  I had some concern there would be a problem if the cellophane were stuck between the rim and the bead but this doesn't seem to have been a problem for Anthony K or Darren Cope.   It looks as though it doesn't matter, but the manufacturer of Rema patches recommends removing it.  I say remove it carefully.  This is best done if you are generous with the vulcanizing fluid and careful to press the patch into place.  "
What height should drop handlebars be - relative to my saddle?,"There is no single official accepted guidance. Typically the more you ride, the lower you will tolerate your bars, drops or straights. Pro cyclists have them as low as 10-15 cm below saddle, while amateurs tend to have them level or slightly higher than the saddle. Don't worry that you cannot spend all your time in drops. Even pro cyclists prefer the more upright position with hands on top of the bars, and will typically go to drops only in critical moments (when in the front, in a breakaway etc.) The thing with the brakes -- well, that's just the way it is with road bikes and drop handlebars. For giving up immediate access to brakes you gain more hand positions on the bars, which helps immensely on long rides. With your hands in the convenient ""on the horns"" position, typically you will be able to apply enough pressure to the brakes to slow down, though for emergency braking you'll need to get down to the drops. You can get an adjustable stem to experiment with handlebar height. Just change it for a normal stem once you decide, or other road cyclists will look down on you -- an adjustable stem is pretty much the mark of a ""Fred"" :-)"
Is this rim still safe to use?,"Sorry, those rims are trash (or wall art). I'd chase down the seller and demand your money back, and report them on whatever sites they were advertising on for selling items in a known dangerous state. The crank may be small now but it will propagate in both directions and get bigger. Cracks on thin section aluminum cannot be welded as the heat will destroy the heat treatment state of the metal around the repair."
Dealing with rust on a steel frame,"The best method for handling exterior frame rust depends on how much time you'd like to invest. The difference comes down to what you use to complete the two basic steps: The most important point to note, though, is to remove as much of the rust as possible before painting. Simply painting over the rust will just seal it in, and allow it to continue rusting away beneath the layer of paint. "
how to choose inner tubes,"700 is the size of the wheel and tire which the tube is intended to fit. In this case, 700 means 700c, or ISO diameter 622mm rims. If you are unfamiliar with tire sizes, take a look here. 28/32 designates the min/max range of width of the tire which the tube is intended to fit, in mm. So in your case, your tubes are designed to fit tires of width 28mm (minimum) to 32mm (maximum). This range should correspond to the width of your rim as well. Edit: From @Benson's comment on this answer (in case it gets deleted) Using a tube that's too big will mean it's exceedingly hard to get your tire back on, because the tube will have to fold out of the way. You'll risk pinching and damaging the tube as you put your tire back on. If you use a tube that's too small, you'll risk the tube stretching too far, which makes it much more vulnerable to popping."

What is the biggest component difference between a cheap road bike and an expensive road bike?,"As with any other equipment, it depends on how much you would like to spend...

Is it possible to fit a chain guard to a bike with derailleur gears?,"SKS Germany - a company that make great bike products, including the fenders that I put on two of my bikes, make a product called the Chainboard - a chain guard designed to accommodate front derailleurs.

Why does cable routing utilize alternation of sections of shielded and unshielded cable?,"I believe one reason is more ""stiffness"" in the cable. Cable housing typically contracts when the cable is contracted. That's why Nokon also builds bicycle cable housing now. With The frame attachments, you get almost half a meter less housing that may contract. This could lead to crisper shift and brake feel. "
Deterrents against partial (component) theft,"For quill stems, you can use a rubber cement to glue a ball-bearing into the socket on the stem bolt, making it so you can't get at it with an allen key.

Are anti-pollution masks effective?,"I get this question once in a while (working in Danish Cyclist Federation). It seems to be based on the idea that commuting by bike will expose you to more pollution than commuting by car. I have seen no research that proves this. However, I have seen research indicating that the opposite might be true. Some was in danish, but here's some in english and french (links to pdf's at the end of this article): http://www.pollution-china.com/Blog/More-exposed-to-pollution-in-a-car.html You should also consider the possible danger of wearing a mask while being physically active. There has been little research in this field that I'm aware of but there could be a risk of creating negative pressure by obstructing the airway which has been known in some cases to produce pulmonary edema. We (again Danish Cyclist Federation) sent some masks to some danish specialists who concluded that the risk was very small, but since pulmonary edema is a very serious thing, I still want to lead your attention to this. Maybe you can find some research (I would be interested to hear about it). Also keep in mind that if the research on ""in-car pollution"" vs ""on-bike pollution"" cited above is true it is much more important for car drivers to consider wearing a mask than it is for bicycle commuters. On top of this comes all the additional beneficial factors that bike commuting produces. Happy cycling."
Why is track cycling done counter-clockwise?,"The UK National Cycling Centre FAQ (PDF) says: Why do the riders go anti clockwise? The Chariots in Roman times raced this way round, and athletic races and most other sports have followed in the same direction. The Straight Dope says: How do these things get started? I've gotten several letters asking why races are ""always"" counterclockwise, and I notice my fellow toiler, Omni magazine game czar Scot Morris, has written a lengthy treatise on the subject. Scot came up with the following list of counterclockwise phenomena: the Indianapolis 500 and other auto races, track and field events, Roller Derby, indoor bicycle races, horse races, speed skating, merry-go-rounds and other carnival rides, revolving doors, the chariot race in Ben-Hur, the customary flow of people around an ice-skating rink, the usual direction in which people spin Hula Hoops, the base runners in baseball, cable-operated model airplanes, and tornadoes and hurricanes in the Northern Hemisphere. ... On the theory that there might be some dark link to our primeval past, Morris asked several distinguished anthropologists, but no luck. He morosely concludes, ""the bias toward moving our whole bodies in counterclockwise cycles undoubtedly can be traced back to the right-handedness of our species and of every human society yet discovered, but how the one led to the other is unclear."" I didn't find it in the general UCI track rules, but it's in the track rules (PDF) of the UCI's World Cycling Centre in Aigle, Switzerland:"
How to store bikes inside a house or unit with limited internal space?,"Friends of mine use a Two-Bike Gravity Stand, and are really happy with it.  It doesn't require any modifications to your apartment, and does a pretty good job at keeping the bikes out of the way.  For myself, I installed a pulley system, but that does involve drilling in the ceiling."
I would like a one-mile-range e-bike: why aren't there any?,"I think the ultimate issue boils down to a lack of demand for such a short-ranged product. Looking broadly at the entire electric vehicle market, range anxiety is fairly common. Most people are worried about not having enough range (even when it's an unreasonable or unwarranted concern)--very few people are actively seeking a short-ranged product when longer-ranged versions are available for little additional hassle.  The bike still needs all the wiring, the motor, the controller, etc. None of those get simpler or go away due to a smaller battery. Hence, if you're going to go through the effort of motorizing a bicycle, you might as well give it a nice big battery. Also, pateksan points out in a comment that the manufacturer's pricing model would be disrupted by such an addition. To quote them: A bike with 1 mile range would probably only be very slightly cheaper to make than one with 10-15 miles. It could therefore be hard to price competitively and without undermining the overall pricing model. If the 10-15 mile bikes were substantially pricier, nobody would buy them. And if the 10-15 was only a little extra, most people would prefer them, so few would buy the 1 mile. There might be technological issues involved as well. Note that the electrical power needed to provide a given acceleration is independent of what battery capacity you use. Also, under a given load, a smaller battery is being used ""harder"" than a larger one. For example, to provide 1A of current, a 1000mAh battery is discharging at 1x its capacity, whereas a 100mAh battery would be draining at 10x its capacity. 1 mile is a very short range, and so a very low-capacity battery would be involved. I would not be surprised if the required current draw is infeasible for such small batteries. Of course, with lithium-polymer technology, such current draws are possible, but lipo batteries tend to be delicate and have an increased fire risk. I believe existing ebike batteries all use regular lithium-ion technology with arrays of cylindrical cells for safety (and cost). Supercapacitors would be a good solution if this product was actually created."
Why are fenders/mudguards undervalued so much?,"In e.g. the Netherlands the majority of the bikes are equipped with fenders and lighting. These bikes are used for everyday transportation. Only Road bikes and all-terrain-bikes are seen without. If Cycling as a transport means is incorporated in the culture, than the bikes offered for sale will be more practically oriented."

How can bum / testicle / inner thigh pain from a saddle be prevented?,"First, do you have cycling shorts w/ a chamois? If not, I would highly recommend them. As a note, they are your underwear (ex: do not wear undergarments and then put on the shorts).  Second, how did you choose your saddle? Was it fitted through some type of measurement system ala bontragers inform system or specializeds BG system? How much did you spend on the saddle and was it appropriate for the style of riding you are partaking in? Third, does your bicycle fit you properly? Have you had it fitted?  So, there are a few points that you could answer to give me some help. I cannot recommend a saddle because everyone is different but I can recommend a brand that provides some type of measurement system for choosing your saddle. 
As well, if you are wearing cycling shorts a nice chamois butter might help with the chafing. "
"I purchased a ""new"" bike from my local bike shop that is five years old--should they have disclosed this?","If it's actually used, as in previously owned with real mileage, they should have disclosed that. If it's in new condition, or new condition with some amount of the discount being for shop wear or due to being a low-mileage return, then I would say there's nothing disingenuous about omitting the manufacture date unless asked directly. For better or for worse, it's not the standard practice in bike shops to include the model year on the sticker, as is seen for example on a car lot. Maybe it's a reasonable question whether that makes the whole industry that much scummier, but following the practice doesn't make any particular shop especially scummy. Many who work at or run shops don't have great feelings about the industry's general insistence on model year cycles. The way it tends to play out is the model year cycle is one of the back industry's tools to generate sales based on perceived obsolescence, whereas we in shops know if a bike was good and worth standing behind 5 years ago, it very probably still is today. Meanwhile, however, the model year cycle creates a need in the retail environment to constantly worry about selling through stock before it becomes last year's model, an artificial panic which really doesn't do the retailer any good in the end. This is only to give some background about common attitudes in shops on the topic."
