How did they make cars fall apart in old movies?,"The 'cab' is hinged round the bottom of the box structure, probably released by Keaton at the appropriate moment, and very likely sprung to assist the demolition. The rest is just balanced on top and will fall at the slightest provocation. You only see it move about 6 feet, so it doesn't have to last long. As I can see no evidence of a rope to pull it [and I don't think painting techniques would be good enough to paint it out afterwards] let's assume someone pushed it from a few yards further back then ran out of frame. It has no engine, of course. If you watch it frame by frame, it's easier to see... In the first 2 frames, all is well so far - except the bonnet/hood isn't quite seated properly. Also note Keaton's hand on the bodywork - that may already be loose [or may be part of the release mechanism]. The wheel at camera right isn't quite straight either...  By frame 3, that wheel is already falling off, before it even hits the bump...
Incidentally, the bonnet/hood has dropped back into its correct position momentarily.
After further analysis, the release has been triggered by frame 3. There is a disconnect at the rear, camera left, and I'm now certain the front wheel, camera right, has a sprung steering mechanism to push it the right way.    by frame 4, the catch has been released and the bodywork is hinging outwards...
The seat is also being hinged backwards and downwards, but we can't see that yet.
[Further evidence of the steering being sprung is that the initial impact with the dirt ridge  momentarily pushes it back straight. The rear wheel is also off by this point and the axle has dropped, assisting the slew - better detail at the end]  Keaton lifts the steering wheel away and the front panel falls forwards - assisting the demolition of the engine bay and grille. One thing to keep track of over the next few frames is that the steering column stays in position relative to the car's chassis, which could be quite a hazard.
[My 'sprung steering theory' is that the spring force has now overcome the bump and is back on track. It's hard to tell from this point if it is only the steering, or if the axle itself bends forwards. [From what little I know of cars from this era, that axle ought to be a solid bar, with steering at the ends.]
Further evidence now shows the entire axle turns, see detail at the end of the post.  Now we can see the seat tilting, preventing Keaton from sliding forwards into the loose debris and containing him within the relative safety of the hinged box. Throwing his legs upwards as the seat drops is a) comedic and b) safer.   Now we get to see the steering column that didn't fall away ...  Note he seems well aware that the steering column didn't fall away - construction error or design, we may never know. You can see him avoid it over the next few frames, even as the car takes a final lurch.
You can also see the clear benefit in these final frames of the seat falling back to 45°, preventing him from sliding forwards.    And that's it. He's already stepping out of the car by frame 11.
Note his exit route is a) planned and b) padded - the original car door.  That is probably a clue as to why the camera right wheel went first, to slew the car in a specific direction. Ten minutes and both he and the car could be ready for another take. Re: the slewing - I've been trying to decide if this frame shows the front axle bending to ensure it goes in that direction. I can't decide.
Perhaps the release mechanism also disconnected the steering on that side, or sprung it across, to push it in the correct direction. 
 Last bit of evidence - from another source - the rear camera-left wheel drops first, assisting the slew, even as the front wheel is turning, before it hits the dirt at all... 
 The front axle in its entirety turns too [on this better footage, there's no sign it bends, but it does turn as a whole piece.  One final note... The wheels never come off. They're tethered, like a modern Formula 1 car.
They fall over but never fully detach from the axle ends.
If they weren't, pure chance would say one of them wouldn't land right next to its own axle - especially the rear which we see come loose long before the rest.   It would appear that the only totally free-to-fly items are the radiator grille and the two headlamps. Everything else, including the last-to-fall front wing/fender, is held firmly in place, at least by one end."
How do they film the mirror scenes in movies?,"If you look closely, you'll almost always note that the mirror is angled so the camera is out of its view. This is sometimes masked by the actor looking directly into [the reflection of] the camera, which gives the impression that he is looking at himself in the mirror.  However, there are at least two other options for getting a shot in which the camera should, by rights, be visible but isn't: The other was used by James Cameron in Terminator 2: Cameron wanted a tracking
shot (camera moving sideways) behind Linda Hamilton removing a chip
from Arnold's head in front of a mirror. If done with a mirror, the
camera would have been visible as it moved around behind the actors. Rather than do this with effects, the set was built so that the mirror was actually a window, and on the other side was a complete mirror-image version of the set on the camera side. Schwarzenegger and Linda sat on the far side facing the camera, and a fancy Arnold puppet and Linda's twin sister sat with their backs to the camera, mimicking all of the moves of their counterparts. Other examples of this are:    In the case of Being John Malkovich, where the shot was from his POV 
the camera man just stood in front of an empty frame in the wall with
Malkovich standing 'inside' the wall on a reverse set of the scene... In the bad attempt of Sucker Punch scene in the dressing room when Sweet Pea, Rocket and Blondie talk about not helping Baby Doll, their movements not matching their mirror images (especially Sweet Pea's). Doubles are being used. This is done so the camera can move behind them without being reflected. You can watch it at this link"
To what extent are child actors exposed to the violent aspects of the movie they perform in?,"I have worked with children on horror films/thrillers and, having found no official guidelines from SAG other than payment policies such as Coogan's Law, I have usually employed a number of tactics. Firstly, I'll go over the scene and storyboard very carefully with the child's parents/guardians (although this isn't always constructive as many parents will let their child do anything to get them on screen ;)). The simplest way I have found is to show the child the effects in play; we look at the props, the make-up, we play with the other actors, and I always use a sweet, edible blood and call it 'juice'. Sometimes our shooting ratio doubles as we end up having to cut more often when the kids or other actors start giggling during a particularly gruesome effect. The previous answers, regarding angles, solo shots and clever editing are spot on. "
What caused and ended the time loop in Groundhog Day?,"According to this review answering such questions in the movie itself would have ""ruined"" it. The original script contained an explanation of the start of the time loop - a voodoo spell - but that was considered a poor idea. So, I wonder if there is a conclusive answer to your question. It was deliberately left out by Harold Ramis. We are left speculating about it (maybe even encouraged to do so) and I think that is one of the reasons why this movie has had so much impact."
Is the Unix operating system featured in Jurassic Park real?,"Yes, it is absolutely a real Unix system, it was a Silicon Graphics workstation (using IRIX, the SGI System V based Unix) running the three dimensional file system browser fsn (""File System Navigator"", pronounced ""fusion""). Silicon Graphics were early developers of hardware acceleration for 3D graphics, so they had the capability to create a 3D file system viewer in 1992, a year before Jurassic Park released. The fact that the SGI logo is visible on the monitor, makes me wonder whether this was an example of product placement. References: Wikipedia:Silicon Graphics, Wikipedia:fsn, SGI-Stuff"
"What's the difference between ""and"" and ""&"" in movie credits?","Found a couple of references although different countries may have different guidelines Source A - US Rules The ampersand (e.g. “Al Gough & Miles Millar”) means that the two writers are a team, and are treated as one person for WGA purposes. The other version (e.g. “Josh Friedman and David Koepp”) indicates that the writers worked at different times. In this case, the screen credits manual says… The order of writers’ names in a shared credit may be arbitrated. Generally, the most substantial contributor is entitled to first position credit. Where there is no agreement among the arbiters as to order of names, or where the Arbitration Committee determines that the credited writers’ contribution is equal, then the Arbitration Committee shall order the writers’ names chronologically. Source B - Writers Guild of America What is the difference between the word “and” and the ampersand (“&”) located between writers' names in a writing credit? The word “and” designates that the writers wrote separately and an ampersand (“&”) denotes a writing team."
Why isn't Bruce Willis's character in the Sixth Sense self-aware?,"This line from Cole I think summed it up best, ""They don't see each other. They only see what they want to see. They don't know they're dead.""   And, except for the girl trying to save her sister, I don't know if you could definitively say any of the other ghosts knew they were ghosts. I think the ""They only see what they want to see"" bit is the key here. In a way the ghosts are making their own reality."
Why do people wear sunglasses in The Matrix?,"For the rebels, it's same reason they wear long trench coats and mostly black clothes. It's a stylistic choice, that both sells the rebels image, that they fly against convention, and the cyber punk look from futuristic stories like Blade Runner and Ghost in the Shell.  When Morpheus meets Neo, he is wearing sunglasses, despite being inside a house during a rainy night. It's just meant to look cool. They'll shed the shades and trench coats when they need to be more practical. Trinity in particular also uses her sunglasses as eye protection when riding a motorcycle twice, both in the first and second movie. For the agents, it's another deal altogether. They wear it as a disguise. An additional layer of impersonality. It's standard MIB fantasy clothing. A dark suit and shades. To the best of my knowledge, the Wachowskis never commented on the shades in particular, but I'll leave here a nugget about shades: Psychologist Paul Ekman, an authority on facial expressions, says that of the 23 facial expressions relating to human emotion, about one-third involve the eyes. Shades may slightly obscure your view of the world, but they also hide the world's view of how you are feeling."
Why cast an A-lister for Groot?,"A-list actors are supposed to be ""bankable stars"", so it makes sense that directors/producers would want one in their movie. But Vin Diesel wasn't the first to audition for the role, as revealed by James Gunn: All of the 'I am Groots' that were earlier voices didn't sound very
  good at all, they sounded like shit. It just didn't really work.  Then
  Vin came in and in one day, laid down all these 'I am Groot' tracks,
  and he's a perfectionist. He made me explain to him with every 'I am
  Groot,' exactly what he was saying …  Then Vin would sit there and he
  would do it and he would it again and again and again, and his voice
  is so rich and so beautiful and he really opened up and was this
  character. It was amazing when we first put that voice in there how
  much the character changed and how much he influenced the character. And Vin Diesel had this to say: I was lucky that I had a director [James Gunn] who was willing to
  indulge me. I told him:  ‘We know that Groot is really saying any
    number of things when he says that line and most people are oblivious
    to the nuances of his speech because of his hardened larynx’.  All you
  hear is the growl but he could be saying any number of things and we
  know that Rocket Raccoon understands him. He doesn’t always tell
  everybody he understands Groot and he plays on that, but he does
  understand him.  So I asked James:  ‘Can you give me a basic idea of
    what he’s trying to say when he’s saying “I am Groot”?’ James had a
  50-page document waiting for me when I came in to do the voice. On the
  left-hand side of the page it said ‘I am Groot’ and on the right-hand
  side it had whatever the line really was if you could understand this
  floral colossus. That was the beginning of trying to go deep into a
  character like this.  In many ways it was the most challenging thing to
  ask an actor to do. The thespian in me responded to the challenge of
  not being able to use facial expressions, physicality or a Golum-like
  vocabulary."
"Is the title ""The Last Jedi"" singular or plural?","As shown by existing answers, director Rian Johnson seems to have a clear answer to the question, but that doesn't make the title of his movie less ambiguous, especially since many of the film's official translations deviate from his opinion (neither do we know who was ultimately responsible for the title anyway). Of course the decisions of whatever international marketing division aren't necessarily more significant than the director's interpretation either, but this unclarity even among the official channels adds to the high ambiguity of the original title. Seeing how that ambiguity is  just centred around the specificities of the English language and the declination of a fictitious word, it might be entirely coincidental and not intended by the film-makers at all, but it is still very much there, and quite apparently so (as your question and the interest it generates shows afterall). We could argue if Luke Skywalker is the only Jedi left or if there are technically other Jedi around. But this is also made quite difficult by the unclarity what a ""Jedi"" actually is (which isn't helped by the institutionalized arm of the Jedi having been destroyed with the rise of the Empire at the end of the prequel trilogy, and the sequel trilogy bringing much more of the fuzzy mysticism back into the Jedi idea). Is it any force sensitive person? Is it some force sensitive gal carrying a bunch old Jedi codices around with her? Or is it only someone who went through a proper 4 year B.Sc. programme in Jedi? But the ambiguity doesn't just end there. As other answers have shown, the films themselves do indeed use these words (in the title sequences as well as in dialogue) to describe a specific individual with them, Luke Skywalker that is. But then again, the mere fact that Luke might indeed be the last of the Jedi makes him also pretty much a representative of the very Jedi religion itself. So he might very well incorporate singular and plural in unison. But beyond arguing about what a Jedi is, how many there are left, or what whoever from Disney thinks the title refers to, there is a strong theme of ending/renewing the era of the Jedi that drives itself through the movie. Afterall, Luke himself (at least initially) wants the Jedi to end for having grown arrogant and Kylo Ren actually agrees with him in that (as does Yoda to some degree). Although, the film isn't entirely uncompromising in its ""out with the old one, in with the new one"" attitude, especially when it has Rey save the old Jedi codices, there is a strong sense of, if not ending, then at least renewing or revising the Jedi idea. And you might argue that the notion of the entire Jedi era ending is represented more by the plural than by the singular, but that alone could very well just be a subjective impression, too. What all these ramblings are hopefully showing is that this isn't really a simple question to answer. But it's also not a simple question to ask either, seeing how the ambiguity adds to the theme of ending the Jedi as well as, in its referral to Luke himself, to the question what Luke actually means for the Jedi as a whole and ultimately to the question what ""Jedi"" and being a Jedi really means, nothing of which is simple to answer. So even if that looks like a lame excuse, we might just resort to the platitude that the question itself is the answer. Coincidental or not, it's a really interesting question and Rian Johnson might either have been joking or a little bit too dismissive in his judgment of it. ;-)"
"Why are films where the bad guy ""wins"" at the end so rare?","TLDR: There are plenty of films where the ""bad guy"" wins.  Ultimately, the reason why the bad guy wins can come down to a number of reasons, including to be more realistic, to set up a later ""good"" ending in another film or because it's unexpected, to name a few reasons. Long Answer (note: there will be spoilers for some films below): There are really a few different things to look at here. For example: Now, the first film that comes to my mind when I think of villains winning is Seven. In it, two police officers hunt down a criminal who is murdering people based on the seven deadly sins. The film ends with the ""bad guy"" manipulated one of the good guys into killed him, thus fulfilling the ""final"" deadly sin. Is this a win? I would consider it so. The good guy's morality was damaged and the bad guy got what he wanted - even if it meant his death. Therefore, I'd consider this under Option 2 above - psychologically defeating the good guy. Another famous example is No Country for Old Men, where the ""good guy"" comes across a lot of money at the start of the film, and spends the film avoiding a hitman who is after him for it. He doesn't succeed. He is killed towards the end of the film. We see the hitman get involved in a car crash. He could have died. Instead, he recovers and walks away. So the good guy is dead, the bad guy survives and walks away. A very clear example of Option 1. Similarly, The Usual Suspects would fall down this road. But what about The Empire Strikes Back? Or Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince?. Or The Hunger Games: Catching Fire. The ""bad guys"" certainly won at the end of those films - but do those count, since they were part of an overall series where the good guys won? When looking at Option 3, I mention the difficulty in defining good and bad. In years gone by, black and white hat symbolism could make this a simple task. But in modern media, it's increasingly difficult. Take a show like Game of Thrones - how does one determine who is ""good"" and who is ""bad""? Everyone will have their own subjective opinion. And what about horror films? Quite a few of the Saw films end with the bad guy winning. Many other horror films do. Do we count these? Similarly, what about Option 4? What is winning. Does Amy win at the end of Gone Girl, a film about a woman who intentionally disappears to heap suspicion on her husband, but returns when it backfires (having murdered another person) and forced him into a situation where he must stay with her. Did they both lose? What about Nightcrawler, where a stringer who films live footage of crimes sets up a scene to kill his partner, so he can film it. He was the protagonist of the film, but that didn't make the creepy ending to this film any more comfortable - but it wasn't supposed to be comfortable. There is a lot of subjectivity around all of this. Therefore, I'd propose to set aside Points 3 and 4 for now. If we just focus on obvious examples of victory, through defeating the good guy or psychologically breaking him, there are a number of fascinating reasons why a film might let a bad guy win: Unexpected It is unexpected for bad guys to win. We got to the films, and watch TV, to be entertained. Often this involves rooting for the good guys, as many of us identify as good ourselves. Of course, these guys might be rogues (like Captain Jack Sparrow, Han Solo), but their characters are written in such a way as to be interesting, relateable and fun. When the tables are turned and the good guy loses, it suddenly becomes unexpected and adds shock value. Cliffhangers Take a show like Mortal Kombat: Conquest. Its first series ended with almost all the good guys dying. The intention was a second series would have resolved this (supposedly by making the first series ending a dream). However, the show was cancelled. So for all of time, there is a depressing ending! There are slightly different examples like I mentioned above, where films that are part of an overall story arc can have cliffhanger endings where the ""bad guys"" win - although this is often to set the good guys up for an even bigger win later on. Realism Films like No Country for Old Men displayed ""bad guys"" winning because it was a genuinely realistic finale that was intended to both shock and horrify. And it worked, brilliantly.  Historically accurate Imagine an infamous criminal from modern or historical times who got rich, lived happy and survived until old age. He has technically ""won"" (and quite possibly defeated many good guys along the way). However, as this is a film that's historically accurate this ""victory"" will be shown, even if people watching the film find it distasteful. So how do audiences react? This is very difficulty to objectively judge. Are we basing this on critic reviews? On box office revenue? For films like The Usual Suspects and Seven, they reacted brilliantly. The endings are adored. For others, they are not. Conclusion: Ultimately, there are plenty of films where the bad guys win. However, the biggest problem I believe for studios in deciding whether the ""bad guy"" should win, is understanding why he is wanted to win. If it is just ""for fun"", they're much less likely to do it. If it's for a twist ending, for shock value, to reflect the brutality of a situation, or to set up an ending for a later, more positive film - then it's much more likely to be acceptable. Film studios do care about audience opinion. If they feel the audience will appreciate the ending or if it fits with the theme of the story, then they'll proceed with it."
"Of all the movies and TV shows ever made, which of them is set furthest in the future?","More of an adjunct to the existing answers - if you're looking for an example where the ""usual"" setting of the movie or show is far in the future (as opposed to a specific episode or segment) then I'd suggest Red Dwarf as the bulk of the show is set over 3 million years in the future."
"How was ""Hodor"" adapted in other languages?",
Why does the talk show host always sit on the right?,"According to Slate: Because it makes them seem powerful. In Western culture, we read from
  left to right, and we watch theater and television that way, too. Our
  eyes end up on the right side of the screen—where the host sits (also
  known as stage left). In the theory of stagecraft, it's understood
  that a rightward placement telegraphs royalty. So no matter how famous
  the guest may be, sitting to the left makes him or her seem
  subservient. Late-night hosts also sit slightly upstage (farther back
  and slightly elevated) from their guests, which likewise reinforces
  the notion of a power imbalance. Stage designers hold that guests make a stronger impression if they
  enter from stage left, crossing in front of the host and shifting the
  audience's focus ever so briefly. Perhaps that's why David
  Letterman—famous for the occasional cutting takedown—makes his guests
  march in from the weaker stage right. Colbert [when he was host of Comedy Central's The Colbert Report] plays with this dynamic
  most self-consciously. Guests wait in the interview area while Colbert
  makes his entrance. He keeps the focus on himself at all times. However, these days there are exceptions: British comedian James Corden made his debut as host of CBS' Late Late
  Show on Monday, promising at least one big change to the familiar U.S.
  late-night talk show format before he even started. ""We’re gonna bring all our guests out at the same time, so all of our
  guests will sit together for all of the chat segments of the show,""
  Corden told KPCC last week. [...] During interviews, Corden sits in an office chair to the left of his
  guests [...], who all share a couch.
  This literally puts him on the same level as the celebrities,
  theoretically allowing for more casual, more intimate conversation.  [...] Interviewing without a desk, as well as inviting multiple celebrities
  on stage at once, is an intentional homage to iconic U.K. chat show
  host Graham Norton. On The Graham Norton Show, there is no desk.
  Norton sits to the left of his guests, who share a single long couch. [...] Bravo's raucous Watch What Happens: Live has perhaps the most unique
  set of any American late-night show. Not only does host Andy Cohen
  lack a desk, but he sits to the left of his guests. (And this is to
  say nothing of the on-stage bar.)"
How did Marty McFly and “Doc” Brown first meet?,According to co-writer/producer Bob Gale: We never explained it in the movie. But the history of the characters that Bob Zemeckis and I created is this: And that’s the origin of their relationship.
Why didn't silent movies have subtitles?,"Film was exposed only once and the quality was not good enough to film the projection of a movie in order to add subtitles underneath in a copy.
The only editing tool was cutting and that's why movies had intertitles (text cards) between shots. As a note, George Méliès, among others, did experiment with multiple exposures but it made parts of the movie blurry and was only useful for adding ghosts or for dream sequences."
Which version of Blade Runner is Blade Runner 2049 a sequel of?,"The director of Blade Runner 2049, Denis Villeneuve was asked this very question and his answer can be found at DenofGeek.com So when Blade Runner 2049 director Denis Vileneuve met with reporters at San Diego Comic-Con, someone inevitably had to ask which version of Blade Runner is Blade Runner 2049 a sequel to. ""The thing is that I was raised with the first one,"" Vileneuve said, referring to the original theatrical cut. ""There was one Blade Runner at the time. I remember seeing the first movie and falling deeply in love with it."" But his love for the original doesn't mean that there isn't room for nuance, or that he can't acknowledge the intent of Scott's later versions of the film. ""The key to making [Blade Runner 2049] was to be in between,"" Vileneuve said. ""[The theatrical version] is the story of a human falling in love with an artificial being, and the story of [the director's cut] is a replicant who doesn’t know he’s a replicant and slowly discovers his own identity. Those are two different stories."" In order to tell his story without alienating fans who prefer one version of the story, the director went back to the source material, Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? for inspiration. ""I felt that the key to deal with that was in the original novel,"" Villeneuve said. ""In the novel the characters are doubting themselves and they aren’t sure if they are replicants or not. From time to time the detectives are running scans on themselves to make sure that they are human. I love that idea so I decided that in the movie Deckard is unsure, as we are, of what his identity is. I love mystery."" As for which version Harrison Ford and Scott consider to be the truth? ""Harrison and Ridley are still arguing about that,"" Vileneuve says. ""If you put them in the same room, they start to talk very loudly about it."""
"How do actors stop breathing when playing ""dead""?","You hyperventilate right before the take, the same technique as for swimming underwater [not highly recommended underwater, but in air, of course, you can change your mind and breathe again at any time]. Also, bear in mind, you're ""dead"" so not doing much in the way of running around getting out of breath.
Zombies would be a whole different question and answer ;) The idea is that you reduce the carbon dioxide levels and slightly increase oxygen levels in your lungs, reducing the urgency to breathe again quite so quickly. It's also helpful if you're in place a good few minutes before the take, so you have time to relax and not have just rushed to set at the last minute, already breathless. So, as you hear the 1st AD prepping for the take you breathe big and deep for 5 - 10 seconds. Each 1st AD uses a slightly different but predictable series of commands to the crew... ""Quiet, please. For a take""
""Running up""
""Roll please"" [to this a dozen others yell ""Turning"" right across the set]
Then sound says ""speed""; you hear clappers announcing the take; camera ops say ""set"" [which is always the final signal that everything is ready to go].
""We're turning... and.. ""
""Action!"" ... you over-breathe until you hear the ""and"" right before action[1] - then breathe right out. Corpses do not breathe.
They do not have inflated chests, so you cannot start with an in-breath, you must have breathed right out. Corpses that breathe get shouted at ;)
""Cut. Reset. We can see the corpse breathing.""
Not a good way to use the studio's money.
Corpses that don't breathe on camera get more work than those who do. In the rehearsal takes you keep your eyes open and watch the cameras, so you know [and can either count in your head or work from any dialogue you can hear] when you need to be mostly still. At other times you can, of course, breathe shallowly until you know you're in frame. If you're not sure and you think it might be significant - ask. Someone can count you through a rehearsal. The other thing to note, from an audience perspective, is that long 3-minute scene where you were amazed at the corpse not breathing for the whole thing probably took a day to shoot. He probably had to not breathe for no more than 30 seconds in any individual take. [1] The ""and"" before Action is often significant and highly emphasised. Background [supporting artists/extras/vehicles etc] often need to be in motion before the action actually starts to keep a fluid look to the scene. ""Go on and"" is a common phrase. Just a late note on In some movies you can tell that the picture is paused when it is on the dead character. I don't think I've ever seen this done [I'm not saying it's never ever been done, but I've never spotted it]. The eye is really very sensitive to movement and a total still image would be quite jarring and noticeable. After comments and other answers...
Note: it's considerably harder to hold your breath whilst breathed out, as opposed to in. You don't have the lungful of oxygen in reserve and the rise in carbon dioxide is more concentrated.
If you didn't know already, the ""urgency to breathe"" reflex is not triggered by lack of oxygen, but by increase in carbon dioxide concentration. Late, late edit, 4 years after:
Just for fun, here are stills from two I had to do after this answer was posted.
One with prosthetic over the eyes, so no worries about blinking, but the scene was done in one long single shot - steadicam, over a minute's duration, ending on me for the last 10 seconds or so, while the forensics guy turns my head to camera for the gory close-up.  This second one was eyes open, staring off into infinity… and involved many cuts and fresh angles, though each take was a couple of minutes. I did have to take a breath half-way one take [because they were running two scenes back-to-back with barely time to hyperventilate between], but they cut around it easily enough. There was one camera angle for which they had to remove the wall camera left in this shot, which could have been an issue for sight line - but I got them to put a light stand with a piece of bright tape right where I needed to be looking, so sight line never changes through the entire scene. In this scene the paramedic had to pick up my arm, then drop it again, without me reacting at all. "
Why does Doctor Strange not bind Thanos in a time loop?,"In Dr. Strange, it was stated that Dormammu belongs to the Dark Dimension and existed outside of time.  Wong: Dormammu dwells in the Dark Dimension. Beyond time. source Generally, when you reverse time, you reverse everything including the memory of the person existing inside the time. Since Dormammu doesn't exist in the time, his memory does not get reset, therefore he gets tired of seeing repeated thing for many times and is defeated. Since Thanos exists inside the time, his memory will be reset, therefore the time loop won't make him tired and fall like it did to Dormammu. Thanos will do what he is supposed to do every time and Dr. Strange will only reset his memory after the end of each loop."
Origin of movie trope where impaled character pulls/pushes blade/spear further into body?,"In Le Morte d'Arthur, published in 1485 and popular ever since, Then the king gat his spear in both his hands, and ran
toward Sir Mordred, crying:  Traitor, now is thy death-day
come.  And when Sir Mordred heard Sir Arthur, he
ran until him with his sword drawn in his hand.  And
there King Arthur smote Sir Mordred under the shield,
with a foin of his spear, throughout the body, more than
a fathom.  And when Sir Mordred felt that he had his
death wound he thrust himself with the might that he
had up to the bur of King Arthur's spear.  And right
so he smote his father Arthur, with his sword holden in
both his hands, on the side of the head, that the sword
pierced the helmet and the brain-pan, and therewithal Sir
Mordred fell stark dead to the earth; and the noble
Arthur fell in a swoon to the earth, and there he swooned
ofttimes. (...) or if you prefer the Wikipedia summary, Arthur charges Mordred and impales him with a spear. But with the last
of his strength, Mordred impales himself even further, so as to come
within striking distance of King Arthur, then gives a mortal blow to
Arthur’s head. This was reversed in the movie Excalibur (1981), perhaps because the filmmakers wanted to show Arthur fighting with the titular sword. Whatever the reason, the film shows Mordred striking the first blow and Arthur pushing himself along his son's spear to strike the second blow. Mallory did not invent the Arthurian myths, and his major source for this material may have been “La Mort le Roi Artu,” also called “Lancelot-Grail”, a French rendition from about 1230. This pushes back the trope about 800 years. However, Mallory is the source that established Arthur in English and American culture, and is the most direct inspiration for modern renditions of the trope."
Why did filmmakers need permission to film in black and white?,"Why did Mel Brooks need to get permission to film in black and white?  Because it would, in most studio executive's minds, make the movie less commercially viable. Who did he need to get permission from? Essentially, the studio..the company/people paying to make it. Financing is generally arranged through studios and production companies. The executives of those companies want to make sure they are investing in a 'product' that will be commercially sucessful and will ask for changes if they feel the 'product' is threatened. In some cases, depending on the contracts, studios have been known to take pictures away from directors (see Blade Runner). Getting permission beforehand is essential. With The Elephant Man, Brooks defied studio convention by hiring an avant-garde director to helm a major production, shooting the film in black and white, and refusing to allow studio brass to tamper with Lynch's vision. When shown a cut of the film, Paramount executives recommended that the surreal opening and closing sequences be removed from the film. According to Cornfeld, Brooks tersely responded, ""We are involved in a business venture. We screened the film for you to bring you up to date as to the status of that venture. Do not misconstrue this as our soliciting the input of raging primitives."" Brooks's stubbornness was rewarded, as the film garnered eight Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Director and Actor. Source - TCM.com"
Has a major film ever intentionally used live ammunition to film a scene?,"Yes, there were some. To name at least one (the earliest I could find proof link about): The Captive (1915)  DeMille’s obsession with realism backfired when an extra, Charles Chandler, was shot and killed by a gun used as a prop on set. Later on, Blanche Sweet confessed that DeMille encouraged extras to use real bullets instead of blanks to create more realistic battle scenes. Source: Wikipedia Also  Angels with Dirty Faces (1938) While filming Rocky's shootout with the police, one scene called for Cagney to be ""right at the opening"" as machine-gun bullets took out the windows above his head. At this point in his career, Cagney had experience with the unpredictability of using live gunfire and he later recalled that either ""common sense or a hunch"" made him cautious. He told Curtiz to ""[shoot the scene] in process,"" and as he got out of the way, ""Burke, the professional machine gunner, fired the shots"". One of the bullets deflected hitting ""the steel edge of the window,"" and going ""right through the wall"" where Cagney's head had been. This experience convinced Cagney that ""flirting this way with real bullets was ridiculous"".  Source: Wikipedia"
Why is the bride's name bleeped in Kill Bill Vol 1?,"Well for the first film and for most of the second, the Bride is on a revenge mission where she is hunting her victims. Her identity would have to be a secret to make sure she doesn't get followed or caught.  It could be Tarantino's way of breaking the 4th wall and including us in the element of mystery and disguise that the Bride has to undertake to remain anonymous. Also, this could mean we are meant to detached emotionally from her as a character until her name is finally revealed as Beatrix Kiddo by Elle Driver.  This is when we see the character as fully vulnerable and when she opens up her emotions. So Tarantino thought of this as the opportune moment to unveil all secrets of this character.  Or perhaps it was just Tarantino being weird and awesome."
At which dream level did Inception end?,"None of the different means you can use to guess whether Cobb is in a dream or not at the end of the movie are completely reliable. The spinning top has huge issues - the fact that it was Mal's totem, that it appears to act in a simplistic way that perhaps other people could dream, hence invalidating its usefulness - and of course the fact that we are never even shown what the top does at the end of the movie. I am unconvinced by how completely watertight the wedding ring theory (referenced in @Eoin's answer), as it seems possible for Cobb to dream the wedding ring when he thinks he is in a dream and not otherwise.  Yes it is an interesting theory, but whilst it is certainly a deliberate action from the writers/director - the meaning is not completely clear.  Cobb clearly seems to treat the spinning top as his totem (flawed or not), as he uses it when flustered by his dream in Mombassa.  So yes, it could be a clue, it could even be his true or second totem - but it is still not completely reliable in my opinion. So is Cobb in a dream at the end? I don't think we can tell.  Unlike the other answer, I like the ambiguity in the movie.  If pushed to give an answer I would say that the fact that he is such an experienced shared dreamer, it seems likely that he would eventually work out if he is in a dream or not - so I guess he is likely to be in the real world, and the wedding ring therefore might be a true clue to that. So to answer the original question, if this is not the real world, what level is this?  Well if the top level of the story is not the real world, and is in fact another dream, then 'who knows' is the only real answer.  The question has no real meaning as there are possibly untold levels of dreaming we have no knowledge of."
Was Kirk and Uhura's kiss in Star Trek really the first interracial kiss on TV?,"There are a couple of reasons for initial suspicion of this claim. I Love Lucy (first episode airing October 15, 1951) featured Desi Arnaz, an Hispanic male, and Lucille Ball, a Caucasian woman, frequently kissing each other.   However, Desi Arnaz was often seen as white with Hispanic ancestry, so this may not count. The British Film Institute found footage an earlier interracial kiss from the television play You in Your Small Corner, broadcast on 5 June 1962. When footage was discovered in November 2015, it was declared to be the earliest surviving footage of an interracial kiss on TV.  This footage was found as part of investigation for a BFI panel on race and romance, and during the panel it was announced that an even earlier interracial kiss was found. Hot Summer Night, another stage play, aired 1 February 1959 as part of the British anthology series Armchair Theatre. This included a kiss between Jack 'Jacko' Palmer (John Slater) and Nell Palmer (Ruth Dunning), who are African and Caucasian respectively.  A July 1964 episode of British soap opera Emergency – Ward 10 had Louise Mahler (portrayed by Joan Hooley, a Jamaican) and Giles Farmer (portrayed by John White, an Englishman) kiss.  The Wild Wild West episode ""The Night the Dragon Screamed"" aired on 14 January 1966 and had Jim West (Robert Conrad) kiss Princess Ching Ling (Pilar Seurat). The former is Caucasian, the latter is a Filipina playing a Chinese princess. Movin' with Nancy aired on December 11, 1967 an had a kiss between Nancy Sinatra (Caucasian) and Sammy Davis Jr. (African).  Believe it or not, Captain Kirk himself has had an interracial kiss on TV before Nichols. He kissed Pilar Seurat (a Filipina) in the Naked City episode ""Without Stick or Sword"", airing 28 March 1962.  However, Shatner is playing the role of Burmese sailor Maung Tun, believe it or not. So this is not an example of the characters having an interracial kiss. Yes, even Star Trek had an interracial kiss before Kirk and Uhura. The episode ""Mirror, Mirror"", airing 6 October 1967, had Kirk (William Shatner) kiss Marlena Moreau (BarBara Luna), whom All Movie lists as being ""of Hungarian-Philippine heritage"".  This was over a year before ""Plato's Stepchildren"" aired on 22 November 1968. There's definitely some wiggle room for what counts as ""interracial"", but it's pretty clear that there are a number of examples of interracial kisses before Star Trek, including ones with Caucasian and African actors.  You could say that Kirk and Uhura's kiss is ""the first Caucasian/African kiss on Star Trek"" or ""the first interracial kiss on Star Trek between main characters"", but certainly not ""the first interracial kiss on TV"".

Who was the oldest actor to play a teenager?,"Aamir Khan was 51 when he played the role of a 19 year old boy in Dangal.

"How did ""Jack"" (the narrator) manage to attract people to join Fight Club?","I think it was the argument more than the fighting that attracted them.  Remember Tyler's philosophy is ""self-improvement is like masturbation, but self-destruction is good"" or something like that.  If he was beating himself up, and then told other people that philosophy, it's easy to see how a club dedicated to self-destruction and the Tyler Durden philosophy came together. "

Why are the Simpsons yellow?,"In an interview with BBC, Matt Groening told them They're yellow because when it was time to pick the colour for the cartoon I didn't want the conventional cartoon colours.

Why do movies still have credits?,"Summary: Detailed Answer: Union Rules/legalities E! Online were asked a question about why movie credit were so long and as part of their answer stated: ""Films have always employed dozens (if not hundreds) of people in
various jobs,"" Clark University director of screen studies Tim Shary
tells this B!tch. ""But before the '60s, they tended to be in teams,
and usually only the leader of the unit received onscreen credit. So,
the art director would be listed but not all of the people (painters,
decorators, landscapers, carpenters, etc.) that worked for him or her.
""Now, almost everyone who works on a film is a member of a union, and
they have expectations about getting onscreen credit."" Could a director like Spielberg or a producer like Scott Rudin decide
to eliminate those credits during one of his 18 daily ego meltdowns?
Not likely, I'm told. During film's golden age, most movie workers
were under contract to a studio, so the suits could credit their
drones--or not--as they saw fit. Today, people hire themselves out
film by film, giving them and their unions more power. ""The presence of many credits today are adjudicated by unions and
guilds,"" says Penn State senior film lecturer Kevin J. Hagopian. ""So,
Steven Spielberg, even as a producer, could not decide simply to leave
off these names."" ...One other factor: cheaper movies. Black-turtlenecked indie fans
love to joke that the size of a small film's credits is inversely
proportional to the size of its budget. (What, you expected these
people to have a real sense of humor?) Instead of paying cash,
indie-film producers often offer key spaces in their credits as a
thank-you. ""When freelancing replaced the studio contract system, studios and
producers realized they could pay people less if they gave them
credit,"" San Francisco State University film professor Joseph McBride
says. ""So, the proliferation of credits went bananas in the '70s and
'80s, to the point that now even the honey-wagon driver is credited."" So there does appear to be legalities involved in having people gain credits. Some examples of this can be seen for particular ""groups"": Acknowledgement used as a form of intellectual property Quoting directly from Wikipedia, which rather nicely sums it up: In the creative arts and scientific literature, an acknowledgment
(also spelled acknowledgement) is an expression of gratitude for
assistance in creating an original work. Receiving credit by way of
acknowledgment rather than authorship indicates that the person or
organization did not have a direct hand in producing the work in
question, but may have contributed funding, criticism, or
encouragement to the author(s). Various schemes exist for classifying
acknowledgments; Cronin et al.give the following six categories: a) moral support
b) financial support
c) editorial support
d) presentational
support
e) instrumental/technical support
f) conceptual support, or peer
interactive communication (PIC) Apart from citation, which is not
usually considered to be an acknowledgment, acknowledgment of
conceptual support is widely considered to be the most important for
identifying intellectual debt. Some acknowledgments of financial
support, on the other hand, may simply be legal formalities imposed by
the granting institution. So it appears many people, from actors through to cameramen, can use the fact they are included in credits as a form of ""proof"" on their CV so to speak, to absolutely guarantee they were involved in a project in that particular role. An example of this on a minor stage, is the IMDB Credit System, which explicitly states that anyone can add their name as an actor to a film, but their system will check it against the official ""credits"" and remove it if not featured. Public interest Whilst I imagine the majority of film watchers do not watch the end credits, there are a some who do (call them Dawsons) and are genuinely interested in how a particular part of a film was achieved (e.g. how a sound effect was completed or who was in charge of animal safety, etc). Edit: To add in some of the fantastic points made in the comments: Tom: People want acknowledgement for their hard work with a place in the credits, regardless of whether the audience will watch it. Damon: The credits add to the length of the movie which increases the amount of money it can be licensed to broadcasters for. Claudio Miklos: The credits are a piece of film history, recording for all time exactly who did what with a film."

Why the greenish tint in the Matrix trilogy?,"The green tint is suggestive of the early monochrome cathode monitors, a piece of imagery associated with early computing:   The Wachowski's wanted to create a mood palette, so they could cross cut between the Matrix and the Real world and an audience could immediately identify where the action was occuring through the use of such a colour scheme."
What significance does Mike Yanagita have in Fargo?,"The ""Mike Yaganita"" subplot is discussed on the Subplot Screenwriting Tips page, and a blog commenter writes: (Source: Kathleen A. Ryan) Every time my husband and I watch FARGO (we own the DVD, & are huge
  Coen bros. fans), we have the same conversation about the purpose of
  the subplot you mention. My guess, however, is this: Marge is
  presented as an intelligent cop; however, she can be very trusting and
  slightly naive about the nature of people. She bought Mike’s story,
  and was shocked after learning Mike lied (and so convincingly). This,
  in turn, propels her to return to Jerry (because maybe he lied,
  too…and the evidence does point to that business). Without this scene,
  what would have prompted Marge to reinterview Jerry? Her instincts are
  confirmed when he “flees the interview.” (I’m a retired cop, and I
  love that scene). This was further clarified by blog commenter Joshua Christopher Mills who wrote: Great article, by the way. I wouldn’t fault anyone on missing the
  point of the Mike Yanagita subplot (I know I didn’t get it for a long
  time), so I think the observation we need to take away from Fargo is,
  perhaps, clarity. Even though the subplot does have a specific, solid,
  necessary purpose, it ends up confusing a lot of viewers because it
  appears unnecessary. The last thing you want to do is lose the audience–luckily the scenes with Mike Yanagita are funny and
  well-written, a definite testament to the Coen’s skill–but most
  writers aren’t the Coen brothers. IMHO, a spot-on analysis. In short, the character/subplot exists to demonstrate to the viewer that she's too trusting of people."
How was this scene shot without hurting Charlie Chaplin?,"Well, I have a theory about how this scene might have been filmed, but I have no sources to confirm this as it is a very old movie. This rock can be a fake one, because using a real one will definitely hurt an actor. Now, when the rock is thrown, actor takes a jump. To make this look realistic, the timing and jump must be perfect.  If you take a close look, you can see that Charlie Chaplin just waited for the perfect time and made a jump (credits to @DrRDizzle we can see Charlie Chaplin's knees bending slightly.). Such scene might have taken practices and takes for a perfect shot."
What is going on in Mulholland Drive?,"When movies.stackexchange.com was announced, the very first thing I thought of was ""how long after launch before someone asks for an analysis of 'Mulholland Drive'?"" Having said that, here is the very abridged version of what's going on. The viewer knows a couple of key points: As is typical in Lynch fashion, things begin to become unclear quickly, and there is a definitive point in the movie where things switch around. When the box is opened, the perspective changes. Although the viewer
  may not realize it, he is now in the real world, the waking world of
  Diane/Betty. The entire first part of the film, up to the opening of the
  box, has been in Diane/Betty's dream. Betty has ultimately come into contact
  with all of the various people (in real life) that she has seen in her
  dream, and (as is typical with our dreams) faces / events are
  re-arranged, mixed up, and re-associated to form bizarre stories.
  

  The opening of the box symbolizes Diane/Betty waking up.
  

  The order of events are re-arranged so that we, the viewer, are able to
  piece together the puzzle (ie. Betty coming into contact with a person
  in real-life...who then becomes a face --but an entirely different
  person with different motives--in her dream). A much more thorough analysis can be found here."
Why are the railings in Rivendell so low?,"There are a few possible reasons for this: The room was specially made for Bilbo, and therefore everything

Why are the books in the Game of Thrones citadel library shelved spine inwards?,"For the record, when you tuck a book away with the title-bearing spine pointing out, you’re carrying on a tradition that began roughly 480 years ago. “The first spine with printing dates from 1535, and it was then that books began to spin into the position we’re familiar with,” says Mari. But before book, there were scrolls, and that’s where Mari’s story starts.  - Libraries Used to Chain Their Books to Shelves, With the Spines Hidden Away
  - Smithsonian Since Game of thrones is a fantasy and seems to be (comparatively) set in what would have been something close to Earth's ""Middle Ages"" with knights and kings all warring constantly this seems to be a pretty accurate depiction of a library. As scrolls gave way to books, new shelves and a new organizational system were in order. For the next fourteen hundred or so years, books, as Henry Petroski, a professor of civic engineering and history at Duke, writes in The Book on the Bookshelf, were shelved every which way but straight up, spine out. Engravings of private studies show books piled horizontally, standing on the edge opposite their spine (their fore edge), as well as turned fore edge out. Before the printing press books were ornate constructions, and in comparison to what came after they were both highly valuable and in short supply. In the Middle Ages, when monasteries were the closest equivalent to a public library, monks kept works in their carrels. To increase circulation, these works were eventually chained to inclined desks, or lecterns, thus giving ownership of a work to a particular lectern rather than a particular monk. When space got tight the monks moved their books to shelves, but they stacked them with the spines hidden. Which, as you can imagine, would have been quite confusing. The solution, Mari says: “Sometimes an identifying design was drawn across the thick of the pages.”  - Libraries Used to Chain Their Books to Shelves, With the Spines Hidden Away
  - Smithsonian So, to answer your question about how they were identified: there were sometimes identifying markings on ""The thick of the pages""."
Does this room exist in the Simpsons' house?,"This is the Simpsons' recreation room. It has indeed been rarely used in the series, but has appeared on the show a few times. Here's one of them (from Lady Bouvier's Lover, Season 5, Episode 21):  And here's another appearance, from Three Men and a Comic Book (Season 2, Episode 21):  The fact that it is rarely seen was parodied in White Christmas Blues (Season 25, Episode 8): Marge: Well, there's a rec room off the kitchen but sometimes it's there and sometimes it isn't.

How accurate is this computer hardware in the movie Wall Street?,"Those are actual stock trading computers used in the 1980s. The manufacturer is Quotron - whose name is on the keypad in the second image. Quotron started providing a computer interface for reporting on and then trading in stocks back in the 1960s, and had 60% of the market in 1980s. The ""funny looking"" keypads are due to the fact that they were designed specifically to support trading and the computers are not designed to be general purpose machines - for example, the number pad with fractions (share prices were set in multiples of 1/8th of a dollar), and the non-qwerty layout since the Quotron only really needed simple text input (looking up trading codes and such)."

What really happened in Memento?,"I don't remember of a car accident, and actually I don't think it fits with the plot. Leonard gets badly injured on the head during the burglary/rape (in his house), which causes his condition. This is actually important, because the last thing he remembers is this aggression (he says so himself), so it follows logically (to him) that his wife was killed during that night. (When actually his wife died only some times later and for another reason.) If his condition didn't originate from that night, he would have formed more memories with his wife after that, and so he would know that she wasn't killed during that night. Which is not the case, so his condition definitely started that night. After that we can guess that the story he tells about Jankis' wife is actually his own story (somewhat distorted), since the policeman tells him that Jankis was actually a fraud that Leonard managed to uncover. So if the story Leonard tells about Jankis does not really apply to Jankis, we can suppose it actually applies to Leonard (at least partially). So I think that for some reason his (Leonard's) wife had doubts about his condition (feared he was faking it) and decided to put him to the test, by repeatedly asking him to give her her insulin shot, which caused her death. And now comes the most interesting (and frightening) part: confronted with the fact that he killed his own wife, Leonard can't accept it and erases the part of the report that explains what happened. And he sets up some random clues that will lead him on a false track for a wrong reason (vengeance), knowing that he will soon forget that those false clues were planted by himself. And also knowing that his last memory (of his wife) will corroborate the idea that she was murdered that night, which will validate his quest for vengeance. So he deliberately (and successfully) manipulates himself (and kills some innocent drug dealer who was set up by Teddy to make money in the process), simply because he knows that a normal life is no longer possible for him (due to his condition as well as the death of his wife) and that he needs a simple goal (vengeance) to keep going forward, day after day. (We can only speculate that once he killed the cop, he will repeat the process with some other random clues, in order to give his life some meaning again. ;) )"
Why does Firefly include a scene with a missing yoke?,"To get the wide shot they had to pull Alan Tudyk's chair back from the console/yoke and Alan Tudyk mimed as though he was still holding the yoke.

Do Sheldon's equations reflect real math/physics research?,"As a mere viewer of The Big Bang Theory, I can't answer this question with certainty, but as a physicist, I can offer a couple observations: So in summary, I'd say almost certainly no, the equations do not in general reflect current progress in research (though the latest couple blog entries on the show's blog suggest that they're trying this). But they are at a much higher level than most other instances of math in movies and TV, and they are actual scientific equations, so you have to give the show credit for that."
"Alice growing effect in 1972 ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" - how was it done? It's not green screen","I agree with BlueMoon93 that the illusion of growth is obtained simply by dragging Alice towards the camera (note that her legs and the floor are not visible).  However, I think that Ames room was not used. The room could have been perfectly ordinary. Meanwhile, the wall to the right, which Alice got thrown against, did not actually join the ceiling: if you take a close look at a still frame, you'll notice that there is no white border between it and the ceiling, like the other walls have, and the left side, where it seems to join the far wall, even is curved, probably to accommodate the pictures. And I didn't see any moment when Alice's shadow passed from this wall to the ceiling. To sum up: Alice is dragged towards the camera, probably on a cart, and ends up next to a small, say half a metre high, fake wall. Clever lighting masks the gaps.  UPD: I went back a little and noticed that the original wall was also sloped, so this is not an argument in favour of a separate wall per se. Nevertheless, while I don't have definite proof, such approach would definitely be much cheaper than building a full Ames room for a few seconds of screen time. "
"Is it true that none of the cast knew what to expect in the famous ""chestburster scene"" in Alien?","It does appear to be somewhat true. UK newspaper The Independent looked at this legend shortly after Hurt's death and cites an old issue of Empire magazine. It all started with Scott's desire for genuine reactions of terror.
""[They] were going to be the most difficult thing. If an actor is just
acting terrified, you can't get the genuine look of raw, animal fear,""
he mused. Cartwright, who famously passed out when cameras stopped rolling,
said: ""We read the script. They showed us a mock-up, but they didn't
show how it was going to work. They just said, 'Its head will move and
it's going to have teeth'. Ron Shusett (executive producer/ screenwriter): Ridley didn't tell the cast. He said, ""They're just going to see it."" The cast was kept away from Hurt and from the set until the last minute: Cartwright: They take John down in the morning to prep him and we're
upstairs for four hours. We're sitting upstairs and nobody knows what
the hell is going on. Harry Dean [Stanton] is sitting in the hall
playing his guitar. Weaver: All it said in the script was, ""This thing emerges."" Offal and discarded fish were used: Scott: Prosthetics in those days weren't that good. I figured the best thing to do was to get stuff from a butcher's shop and a fishmonger.
On the morning we had them examining the Facehugger; that was clams,
oysters, seafood. You had to be ready to shoot because it started to
smell pretty quickly. You can't make better stuff than that - it's
organic. Dan O'Bannon (executive producer/screenwriter): Once the creature was
rigged up, they stuffed the chest cavity full of organs from the
butcher's. Then they ran a couple of big hoses to pump the stage
blood. During all this Ridley moved about, tending to the finest
detail. I remember easily half an hour was spent with him draping this
little piece of beef organ so it would hang out of the creature's
mouth. This added to the cast's experience: Cartwright: When they finally take us down, the whole set is in a big
plastic bag and everybody is wearing raingear and there are huge
buckets around. The formaldehyde smell automatically made you queasy.
And John is lying there. Weaver: Everyone was wearing raincoats - we should have been a little
suspicious. And, oh God, the smell. It was just awful. Then they started filming the scene: Cartwright: They have four cameras going. You see this thing start to
come out, so we all get sucked in, we lean forward to check it out.
They shout, ""Cut!"" They cut John's T-shirt a little more because it
wasn't going to burst through. Then they said, ""Let's start again."" We
all start leaning forward again and all of a sudden it comes out. I
tell you, none of us expected it. It came out and twisted round. And Ridley Scott got the reactions he wanted: Weaver: All I could think of was John, frankly. I wasn't even thinking that we were making a movie. Ivor Powell (associate producer): I hadn't expected it to be quite
that intense. Weaver: Look, I worked with Roman Polanski on Death and the Maiden -
he would shoot a gun off. You can act, sure, but when you're surprised, that's gold. Shusett: Veronica Cartwright -- when the blood hit her, she passed out. I heard from Yaphet Kotto's wife that after that scene he went to his
room and wouldn't talk to anybody. Kotto: Oh man! It was real, man. We didn't see that coming. We were
freaked. The actors were all frightened. And Veronica nutted out. A well-researched 2020 article offers some more details about how the scene was filmed: Four cameras were ready to roll for optimum footage. Sigourney Weaver (Ripley) could see the screenwriters huddled in the corner, gleefully awaiting the mayhem to come. A thin cut was made in the cavity T-shirt so that it would rip easily when the puppeteer below thrust the creature upwards. At first it didn’t come through, so when they tried again the actors were already leaning in, and the amount of blood that burst forth really shocked them. Veronica Cartwright got a face full and actually flipped right over in surprise on the now slippy floor. She realised the cameras were still rolling and had to scramble back in shot. To have the creature then shoot off across the table, a slit was cut through it, and someone yanked the puppeteer, who was lying on a small camera dolly. The tail whipping back and forth was achieved by inserting a thin tube through it and pumping it with compressed air. It is telling that there are no outtakes of actors or crew bursting into laughter. The atmosphere was highly charged: nothing like this had ever been seen before. The 2019 documentary Memory: The Origins of Alien also spends quite some time on the scene. Most of what is said aligns with what is said above, but it does add some interesting details: Cartwright: So we start to roll, and then all of a sudden, Ridley shouts, cut. Cut. xxxx: It didn't work on the first take. There wasn't much of a chestburster. It couldn't get through the damn t-shirt. [...] xxxx: Second time, it still didn't go through, but it came up like that, and then went down and covered in blood. And the actors were all kind of looking like that and curious. So it was a stroke of genius that it went wrong. They still didn't know what was coming. [...] xxxx: And this thing goes up through, splat. They fire all the pumps. xxxx: It was just exactly what Scott wanted. It was just this absolutely immediate visceral response. Catwright explains what actually happened to her: I had leaned into a blood jet. That little blood shot me square in the face. And that's when I jumped back and I went, oh my god. And my knees hit the back of those banquette where we were all sitting, and it flipped me upside down. And I said, oh my gosh, we're still shooting. So I rolled over and I got back up, and I ran around and got back into the scene. (I am still working to correctly attribute some of those quotes, since the persons speaking are only introduced once in the movie.)"
Why are the American flags backwards on the warden's uniform in Orange is the New Black?,"It's traditional (but not required except in the military) for the US flag to be represented as flowing backwards as the person moves forwards. Think of the flag, not as a patch, but as a loose flag attached to the Soldier's arm like a flag pole. As the Soldier moves forward, the red and white stripes will flow to the back. This article explains it better than I can. Civilians often wonder why the US Army Flag Patch is reversed. The answer is: not all Army Flag Patches are reversed, but only those worn on the right shoulder. The reason has to do with proper display of the flag. The blue field of stars should always be in the highest position of honor. When viewing the flag on a wall, the highest position of honor is the upper left when displayed horizontally, and at the top (upper left) when displayed vertically. When displayed on a ""moving object"" like a person or vehicle, the highest position of honor is the front, and not the rear; so the field of blue should be displayed to the front. In application, then, flags are displayed on moving vehicles with the blue-star field always displayed towards the front of the vehicle. In this way, the flag appears to be blowing in the wind as the vehicle travels forward (flags are always attached to their flag poles on the blue field side). If the flag were not reversed on the right hand side of the vehicle, the vehicle might appear to be moving backwards (or ""retreating""). The next time you visit an airport, notice that the US-flagged aircraft also have a ""reverse"" flag painted on the right side of the aircraft. For flag patches worn on uniforms, the same principle applies: the blue star field always faces towards the front, with the red and white stripes behind. Think of the flag, not as a patch, but as a loose flag attached to the Soldier's arm like a flag pole. As the Soldier moves forward, the red and white stripes will flow to the back."
First movie with product placement?,"In the documentary ""The Greatest Movie Ever Sold"" (a film specifically about the topic of product placement), director Morgan Spurlock notes that one of the first recognized product placements was in the 1919 Roscoe Arbuckle comedy The Garage, in which a Red Crown Gasoline logo was displayed on screen. I expect watching the documentary would more than likely provide insight into product placement's rise in popularity in tv and film. Source: Product Placement on Movie Screens"
How do actors memorize extremely long scripts?,"Unless they're performing in a play, actors don't generally memorize the entire script before the film starts shooting. The reality is, the film will take (on average) 6-12 weeks (or more) to film and the script will likely change constantly. While it's certainly good for an actor to be very familiar with the script so they know what's going to happen, the reality is, many actors memorize a few days' worth of script and work on it in rehearsals or in their private time... and some show up to set without it memorized at all... or reviewed... don't ask me how they survive. I think it's magic or something. When you only need to do 1-3 pages worth of script in a day, you have plenty of time to memorize. In general, actors do have good memories... and part of their training is honing this ability... but good actors know the gist of what they're saying and the words should be natural to them, not ""learned by rote"". Many directors want natural performances and give actors some leeway to work inside the script a bit so that it feels natural to their character. Memory is one of those things that gets better as you use it... if you practice memorizing things, you will get better at it. It's how servers at restaurants can memorize convoluted orders and still get everything right... they have practice memorizing stuff."
Why does Harry only make use of time travel in The Prisoner of Azkaban?,"From what I remember about the books and the films, Hermione only gets given the Time Turner device in her third year at Hogwarts. She was given it, with the permission of the Ministry of Magic, so that she could attend two sets of lessons at once. In this link, you can see that she stated that the pressure of using it to do twice as much work became too stressful, so she returned the device to the ministry. In the following year, all the devices were destroyed during the battle at the ministry, so it was not possible to use the device again. I am therefore guessing that the art of creating such a device was lost in the years since they were first made."
What has the greatest chance of being in Marcellus Wallace's briefcase?,"Roger Avary, the co-writer of Pulp Fiction says: Originally the briefcase contained diamonds.  But that just seemed too
  boring and predictable.  So it was decided that the contents of the
  briefcase were never to be seen.  This way each audience member would
  fill in the blank with their own ultimate contents.  All you were
  supposed to know was that it was ""so beautiful.""  No prop master can
  come up with something better than each individual's imagination.  At
  least that was the original idea.  Then somebody had the bright idea
  (which I think was a mistake) of putting an orange lightbulb in there.
  Suddenly what could have been anything became anything supernatural. 
  Didn't need to push the effect.  People would have debated it for
  years anyway, and it would have been much more subtle.  I can't

"Why are ""blockbusters"" called blockbusters?","Originally the word was used to describe large bombs dropped during World War II that could quite literally destroy an entire city block, or a ""blockbuster bomb"". The origins of the term when it comes to film, according to Wikipedia: In film, a number of terms were used to describe a hit. In the 1970s
  these included: ""spectacular"" (The Wall Street Journal),
  ""super-grosser"" (New York Times), and ""super-blockbuster"" (Variety).
  In 1975 the usage of ""blockbuster"" for films coalesced around Steven
  Spielberg's Jaws and became perceived as something new: a cultural
  phenomenon, a fast-paced exciting entertainment, almost a genre.
  Audiences interacted with such films, talked about them afterwards,
  and went back to see them again just for the thrill. The gist is that people would, ""Line up around the block,"" to see these films, when theaters were much smaller and had only a few screens, unlike today's multiplexes. So they quite literally ""busted the block"" as a single city block couldn't fully contain the line. Borrowing from its wartime connotation, the line of people could almost be said to have destroyed the block, as they could almost certainly bring foot traffic to a halt.     "
"In what spot would the new Star Wars movie ""Rogue One"" go in the Machete Order?","Rod Hilton, the originator of Machete Order, answered this very question in his follow-up post to Machete Order.  He includes a helpful diagram as his answer to this and future questions like it: Where Does Rogue One fit? ""Since Rogue One is basically a prequel to IV, should Machete Order start with it?"" Every time a new Star Wars movie comes out, I get a bunch of tweets and e-mails asking where it fits in Machete Order. It's flattering people care so much, but my answer is probably going to always be the same. So I'm going to try and answer it once and for all. 
(modified slightly per request) He follows the diagram with several paragraphs of justification, but essentially, his point is that, although Rogue One provides background on the events leading up to Episode IV, that movie has been beloved for 40 years without needing this additional background.  As a result, it is unnecessary to the story of the original 5 ""Machete Order"" movies."
Did silent film actors actually say their lines or did they simply improvise “dialogue” while being filmed?,"From the article Silent Movie Revisited with an emphasis of mine, Third, one should also stress the important contribution of this book to the critical reappraisal of many stereotypes concerning the early years of the cinema, such as the (completely false) idea that silent movies were not scripted or that the actors did not really pronounce their lines as they were supposed to do. There is now a whole lot of evidence that those scripts existed, and that they really were the base of the whole production. Moreover, lip reading experiments have shown that the scripted lines corresponded with what the actors actually pronounced, and there are testimonies that the first spectators noticed when a ""silent"" actor pronounced, say, ""What do we have for dinner tonight"" instead of ""I really love you, you know"". Of course, they said more lines than what written on title cards, but it is just to give the gist about what characters in the scene are up to."
Why is there no Robin in the Nolan-directed Batman movies?,"It's a matter of the director having a specific vision of how his Batman stories will become. In the first two films, Christopher Nolan wanted to bring Batman back to his roots, explore how Bruce Wayne became Batman, and how Batman became the legend he is (in the 1989 Batman film, when Vicki Vale asks Bruce why bats, he replies ""They're great survivors""; in Batman Forever, we get a VERY brief glimpse of bats on Bruce's mind. That's all the motivation we get). Batman Begins was very much an origin story, showing also the training Bruce took to become Batman. The Dark Knight follows soon after that story, as the ending of Batman Begins sets up The Joker to enter the story. The thing is, I tried looking up the reason, and I can't yet find any quotes online from Christopher Nolan (see this article here for an expanded story on this). The next film, The Dark Knight Rises, supposedly takes place 8 years after The Dark Knight. It also features Bane, a character who became notorious for eventually breaking Batman's back. It's entirely conceivable that Nolan will include Robin in this film as his protege who can help him fight Bane. Nobody outside the film set really knows. Me, I'm looking forward to finding out in 2012."
Why does George Mcfly employ Biff to wax his car after he had previously tried to rape his wife?,"I haven't seen any director commentary, so I can't speak with full authority. However, I don't think they thought that hard about it.  I think it is put in there for dramatic effect. The antagonist was defeated, and now instead of the big man on campus, he practically begs from George McFly for work.  It is a triumph of the little guy over his oppressor. The movie is full of David vs Goliath moments, and that's when you know the underdog ultimately won."
What is the real reason for the Joker's scars?,"The pure nature of the Joker, especially in the movie sense, is to be completely chaotic wanting ""to watch the world burn"".  In other words, the Joker is the very definition of the alignment: Chaotic Evil In the movie, the conflicting stories about his past are there on purpose to continue this nature of just being an agent of chaos. Notice how we're never given a flashback of events during his story-telling, something very prominent in the movies in order to remind the audience of events past.  Even Ra's' origins were given flashbacks, although brief and nondescript. The only facts to his backgrounds are that he started in Gotham, pitting low-level criminals against each other in elaborate robbery schemes where he comes out on top, with money. As a point of reference, the opening scene of The Dark Knight shows his most recent attempt, with a lack of surprise from Gordon on the situation of criminals killing each other during a heist. But this is only the past year (time between the end of Batman Begins and the beginning of The Dark Knight) and the rest of his timeline is what we see in the movie. For clarification and emphasis of the answer: As far as the comics, the same is true: There are a multitude of origins of the Joker told from being a washed up comedian that went nuts, to just being that way from the start. Though many have been related, a definitive history of the Joker has never been established in the comics, and his true name has never been confirmed. No recounting of the Joker's origin has been definitive, however, as he has been portrayed as lying so often about his former life that he himself is confused as to what actually happened. As he says in The Killing Joke: ""Sometimes I remember it one way, sometimes another... if I'm going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice!"" source The one true constant of any depiction of the Joker is that he wants to assert to Batman that all it takes is One bad day to send anyone into the insanity that he lives everyday. The most prominent of this is during the short story The Killing Joke where he tortures Gordon almost to this point. And this is also what makes the Joker such the notorious villain that he is.  No one can ever be certain of anything of him or what he will do.  Whether it be something as simplistic as his background to any of his plans, constantly fooling even the pinnacle of detectives like Batman on multiple occasions. As a final side note about Joker origin, the story that is most accepted as the ""true"" origin is The Killing Joke Where he quits his job to be a comedian and goes completely nuts after being knocked into a vat of acid that bleaches his body the traditional Joker colours (all caused by Batman during a heist gone wrong). But as there is no confirmation of this origin to the Joker, even this can be taken with a grain of salt. The Dark Knight's interpretation of the Joker is based primarily on the character's first two appearances in the Batman comics, as well as Alan Moore's one-shot comic book Batman: The Killing Joke, which was given to Heath Ledger in order to prepare for his role.

"Are there any indications why Roddenberry chose to make Star Trek a ""battleship universe""?","I suspect that this started with Roddenberry's vision of the Enterprise. He had some specific requirements... ""We're [...] out in deep space, on the equivalent of a cruiser-size spaceship. We don't know what the mode of power is, but I don't want to see any trails of fire. No streaks of smoke, no jet intakes, rocket exhaust, or anything like that [...]. It will be like a deep space exploration vehicle, operating throughout our galaxy. Roddenberry further specified that the Enterprise would operate mainly in space, have a crew of 100-150, and be incredibly fast. Wikiepdia The very specific design informs how large other ships (Federation or otherwise) would tend to be, unless the demands of the plot require otherwise. Recall that this is intended to be an armed exploration vessel and frigate/cruiser sizes are kind of traditional in that role since the crew complement and hold sizes (probably not factor in Trek) would require a minimum size for extended (5-year) missions/voyages."
Why didn't Gollum take the ring back from Bilbo between The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings?,"He did eventually (after some years: remember that Gollum has a hatred and fear of the Sun, the Moon and other creatures, so it took some time) leave the Misty Mountains in pursuit of Bilbo Baggins, but was eventually drawn south, towards Mordor, because all evil was being drawn to Mordor, at the time. This is how he discovered the secret stair by Minas Morgul, and how he encountered Shelob. This is all described in a chapter of the first book in Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings book series called ""Shadow of the Past"" What is more, he knew where he came from.’
  ‘But how did he find that out?’ asked Frodo.
  ‘Well, as for the name, Bilbo very foolishly told Gollum
  himself; and after that it would not be difficult to discover
  his country, once Gollum came out. Oh yes, he came out.
  His longing for the Ring proved stronger than his fear of
  the Orcs, or even of the light. After a year or two he left the
  mountains. [...] ‘Light, light of Sun and Moon, he still feared and hated,
  and he always will, I think; but he was cunning. He found he
  could hide from daylight and moonshine, and make his way
  swiftly and softly by dead of night with his pale cold eyes,
  and catch small frightened or unwary things. He grew
  stronger and bolder with new food and new air.
—The Fellowship of the Ring: The Lord of the Rings, Part 1, Chapter II,
   ""The Shadow of the Past"" At some point during this travel, he was captured and taken to Barad-dur, where he was tortured and forced to reveal to Sauron the two words ""Shire"" and ""Baggins"". Frodo asks the same question you do: ‘Then why didn’t he track Bilbo further?’ asked Frodo.
  ‘Why didn’t he come to the Shire?’
  ‘Ah,’ said Gandalf, ‘now we come to it. I think Gollum
  tried to. He set out and came back westward, as far as the
  Great River. But then he turned aside. He was not daunted
  by the distance, I am sure. No, something else drew him away [...] I am afraid there is no
  possible doubt: he had made his slow, sneaking way, step by
  step, mile by mile, south, down at last to the Land of Mordor.’ [...] ‘Yes, to Mordor,’ said Gandalf. ‘Alas! Mordor draws all
  wicked things, and the Dark Power was bending all its will to
  gather them there. The Ring of the Enemy would leave its
  mark, too, leave him open to the summons. And all folk were
  whispering then of the new Shadow in the South, and its
  hatred of the West. There were his fine new friends, who
  would help him in his revenge!
—The Fellowship of the Ring: The Lord of the Rings, Part 1, Chapter II,
   ""The Shadow of the Past"" We know all this because Aragorn captured Gollum, at the request of Gandalf (Gandalf asks this of Aragorn shortly after Bilbo's birthday feast) and Gollum confessed to all of this, and Gandalf, with his divine knowledge, did a lot of deduction. By the time Gollum was released and he resumed his pursuit, the ring had already left The Shire in the hands of Frodo, who was being escorted as a member of The Fellowship. That's why, in the movies, we meet Gollum tailing the fellowship in Moria, which prompts the following scene and dialogue: 

 A book answer is necessary to answer this question because the movie insufficiently explains Gollum's actions between The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings with a single line in the chapter of the movie The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) of the same name (""Shadow of the Past""). This line serves as enough exposition to let us, the audience, know about their immediate danger, that Gandalf went looking for Gollum but that the enemy found him first, which is good enough information for the story being told in the movie, but not enough to explain in detail what happened to Gollum between The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings - we need the books to fill that gap. Since the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy, from the characters down to the dialogue, is a pretty faithful adaptation of the books, it makes sense to use the book as a reliable source of further information that the movies don't provide."
"Who is the true villain of Peter Pan: Peter, or Hook?","Short Answer: I disagree that Captain Hook could ever not be a villain. Most people have an innate sense of right and wrong and can easily tell when someone else is doing something obviously bad to them, and less easily tell when they are doing something obviusly bad to someone else.  And of course when the evil that they do is not so obvious but requires some thought to realize that innate sense doesn't work so well. So good and evil are not relative.  Being better than someone else doesn't make someone good; to be good someone has to pass the minimum standards for goodness, even if they are many times better than the more evil persons around them. So Peter Pan can be interpreted as being evil, and so one of the villains in Peter Pan, without making every other character better than they are; without making them good enough to not be villains. Captain Hook was a pirate.  All pirates are evil criminals and thus are villains in any stories they are in, even the stories which make them protagonists. Piracy is robbery at sea, always with the threat of violence (makng terroristic threats) and often with actual violence (assault, murder, etc.).  Such actions are crimes at sea as well as on land for good reasons.  Piracy is not evil because it is illegal, it is illegal because it is evil. Nautical trade has been an important part of the world's economy for millennia, and in recent centuries it has become more and more vital for civilization.  Discouraging and interrupting that trade is bad for hte world as a whole. Because of the vital importance of nautical trade to keep people alive, it is wrong and evil, though legal, when naval forces of a country sieze merchant ships of countries they are at war with and blockade their coasts.  It is even more wrong and evil, though still legal in some countries, for a country to commission civilian privateers, undisciplined and more likely to commit atrocities for profit, to attack the merchant shipping of countries they are a war with.  And it is more wrong and evil still, and totally illegal, for private individuals to become pirates and attack merchant ships of all countries. If any changes should be made in those laws, it should be to forbid the use of privateers and navies to sieze enemy merchant ships and blockade coasts and make such practices as illegal as piracy is, not to make piracy as legal as those practices are now. It is possible that some of the teenage pirates in history were young enough to not be legally guilty of piracy, and so might not have been evil.  And I guess that John King and the boy captured with Nicholas Brigaut were young enough pirates to not be considered villains. And it is possible to describe a fictional character as a pirate, and for characters to describe them as a pirate,  without them committing any acts of piracy as far as the readers or audience can tell, and without giving much evidence that they commit acts of piracy offstage.  Such a character fits the TV trope of ""The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything"": https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePiratesWhoDontDoAnything[3] But pirates who don't do anything are not really pirates, and I think that almost every single version of Peter Pan depicts Captain Hook and his crew behaving enough like real pirates to be considered evil.  So Captain Hook is a villain. And Hook has no justification for seeking revenge on Peter Pan for cutting off his hand.  Instead Hook should have been grateful to Peter Pan for merely cutting off his hand and so treating Hook a lot better than he deserved. Long Answer: Part One: Protagonists and Antagonists, Heroes and Villains. Writers have two sets of terms for main characters: Protagonist and antagonist, and hero and villain. In the vast majority of stories, there is a least one protagonist, and sometimes several, who the story follows and who the audience usually wants to succeed in their goals.  The obstacles the protagonists have to overcome usually include one or more characters called antagonists who oppose the efforts of the protagonists. In fiction, a hero is someone who makes great efforts to achieve goals which are good, and often those goals are of great benefit to many other people.  In fiction a villain is a character who makes efforts to achieve goals which are bad or even evil, and often those goals are very harmful to many other people. It is possible to write a story without heroes and villains.  Suppose their is story where a little child seeks to get a treat which their mother says they shouldn't get.  A writer could make either the child or the mother the protagonist, thus making the other one the antagonist of the story.  But it would take some very great writing to make the readers think that either character was a hero or a villain. I note it is traditional in the stage version of Peter Pan Mr. Darling and Captain Hook are usually portrayed by the same actor, to show that both are antagonists.  But obviously Mr. Darling isn't depicted as being evil enough to be a villain. In works of fiction which have heroes and villains, the protagonists are usually the heroes and the antagonists are usually the villains. But that doesn't have to be the case. Both the protagonist and the antagonist can be heroes.  Both the protagonist and the Antagonist can be villains.  The protagonist can be a hero and the antagonist can be a villain.  The protagonist can be a villain and the antagonist can be a hero. And sometimes protagonists and/or antagonists are on the borderline between good and evil. Part Two:  An Example of Villain Protagonists and a Hero Antagonist. For example, there is the Disney television movie The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes (1995), a loose remake of the 1969 move.  In the 1995 version, Medfield College reaches a new low, taking their tradition of cheating in sports into academics.  There is a TV program where college students compete to answer questions. A freak accident, possibly only in goofy movies, gives Medfield student Dexter Riley all the information on the internet. So the dean of Medfield makes Dexter compete in the program and win games, giving the impression that Medfield has a good education system to increase enrollment. The dean tells Dexter that if he doesn't compete his slacker buddies will be expelled. At the rival Hale University, where 12-year-old Norwood Gills had been the reigning champion, the Dean schemes to get Dexter to come to Hale University. Obviously Dexter and his friends are the protagonists, and the Deans of Medfield and of Hale, and two sinister government agents, and Norwood, are antagonists.  But are there heroes and villains? The two government agents are ruthless enough to throw Dexter out of the back of a moving vehicle, and never prove that they work for the US government. The Dean of Medfield College wants to lie and claim that Medfield has a great educational system, tricking hundreds or thousands of persons into enrolling there at a cost of thousands of dollars each.  So he wants to commit grand larceny and fraud. He pressures Dexter into becoming his accomplice in crime. The dean of Hale University has been using Norwood for similar fraudulent advertising and tries to use Dexter for similar deception. So basically all of the protagonists and antagonists are villains - except for Norwood.  Norwood tries to expose Dexter's fraud.  He does that for selfish personal reasons but has to be aware that it will also prevent hundreds and thousands of people from being conned out of their money.  So that makes Norwood a hero in my book.  And during the short period of the story - such is Norwood's anger - he comes to understand how knowledge was implanted into Dexter's mind and how to implant knowledge and how to erase it - such is Norwood's genius. So i say that little known tv movie is a great example of a story where all the protagonists and most of the antagonists are villains, and one of the antagonists is the hero. When person A is originally described as the good guy and person B is originally described as the bad guy, and then someone tries to convince me that the opposite is true, they have an uphill battle to convince me. I am cynical enough that such an effort would usually only half succeed, so that I decide that the good guy was actually bad but not that the bad guy was actually good. Thus such attempts to revise stories or history usually end up with me thinking that the conflict was between two different groups of bad guys. Part Three:  The Evidence for Hook's Villain Status in the novel Peter Pan I found an online text of Peter Pan. In ""Chapter IV The Flight"": John said “How ripping,” but decided to have tea first. He asked if there were many pirates on the island just now, and Peter said he had never known so many. “Who is captain now?” “Hook,” answered Peter, and his face became very stern as he said that hated word. “Jas. Hook?” “Ay.” Then indeed Michael began to cry, and even John could speak in gulps only, for they knew Hook’s reputation. “He was Blackbeard’s bo’sun,” John whispered huskily. “He is the worst of them all. He is the only man of whom Barbecue was afraid.” “That’s him,” said Peter. The pirates are introduced in ""Chapter V The Island Come True"" The boys vanish in the gloom, and after a pause, but not a long pause, for things go briskly on the island, come the pirates on their track. We hear them before they are seen, and it is always the same dreadful song: “Avast belay, yo ho, heave to, A-pirating we go, And if we’re parted by a shot We’re sure to meet below!” So the pirates themselves admit that they are so evil they are damned. A more villainous-looking lot never hung in a row on Execution dock. Here, a little in advance, ever and again with his head to the ground listening, his great arms bare, pieces of eight in his ears as ornaments, is the handsome Italian Cecco, who cut his name in letters of blood on the back of the governor of the prison at Gao. That gigantic black behind him has had many names since he dropped the one with which dusky mothers still terrify their children on the banks of the Guadjo-mo. Here is Bill Jukes, every inch of him tattooed, the same Bill Jukes who got six dozen on the Walrus from Flint before he would drop the bag of moidores; and Cookson, said to be Black Murphy’s brother (but this was never proved), and Gentleman Starkey, once an usher in a public school and still dainty in his ways of killing; and Skylights (Morgan’s Skylights); and the Irish bo’sun Smee, an oddly genial man who stabbed, so to speak, without offence, and was the only Non-conformist in Hook’s crew; and Noodler, whose hands were fixed on backwards; and Robt. Mullins and Alf Mason and many another ruffian long known and feared on the Spanish Main. In the midst of them, the blackest and largest in that dark setting, reclined James Hook, or as he wrote himself, Jas. Hook, of whom it is said he was the only man that the Sea-Cook feared. He lay at his ease in a rough chariot drawn and propelled by his men, and instead of a right hand he had the iron hook with which ever and anon he encouraged them to increase their pace. As dogs this terrible man treated and addressed them, and as dogs they obeyed him. In person he was cadaverous and blackavized, and his hair was dressed in long curls, which at a little distance looked like black candles, and gave a singularly threatening expression to his handsome countenance. His eyes were of the blue of the forget-me-not, and of a profound melancholy, save when he was plunging his hook into you, at which time two red spots appeared in them and lit them up horribly. In manner, something of the grand seigneur still clung to him, so that he even ripped you up with an air, and I have been told that he was a raconteur of repute. He was never more sinister than when he was most polite, which is probably the truest test of breeding; and the elegance of his diction, even when he was swearing, no less than the distinction of his demeanour, showed him one of a different cast from his crew. A man of indomitable courage, it was said that the only thing he shied at was the sight of his own blood, which was thick and of an unusual colour. In dress he somewhat aped the attire associated with the name of Charles II, having heard it said in some earlier period of his career that he bore a strange resemblance to the ill-fated Stuarts; and in his mouth he had a holder of his own contrivance which enabled him to smoke two cigars at once. But undoubtedly the grimmest part of him was his iron claw. Let us now kill a pirate, to show Hook’s method. Skylights will do. As they pass, Skylights lurches clumsily against him, ruffling his lace collar; the hook shoots forth, there is a tearing sound and one screech, then the body is kicked aside, and the pirates pass on. He has not even taken the cigars from his mouth. I think that is enough to establish that Hook is evil and a villain in the book Peter Pan. Of course there are many movie, television, comic book, etc., versions of Peter Pan, and  in some of them Hook doesn't act as evil as in other versions. But in any version where Hook is identified as a pirate, he is by definition evil, and so is a villain in the story, even versions where he is not the only villain and where his opponents are also villains."
How is color determined when colorizing black and white movies?,"It doesn't matter what were the original colors. As the movie was filmed in black and white, the set, the costumes, even the makeup was designed to look good in black and white and not to have correct color. A famous example is the sets of the Addams Family which were built in pink, but the filming rendered them in grim colors. The emulsion of early films (about 1920s and earlier) was almost completely insensitive to red (reds were rendered as blacks) but on the other hand, it was overly sensitive to UV. One can say that the movies were filmed in ultraviolet, so not only the colors were ""lost"", but even the luminance we see on the film is absolutely nothing like the actors and set looked like to a naked eye. Here's an excellent article about peculiarities of early-film makeup, (credit to user151841 and 1006a for finding it) which explains how the actors were painted in colors resembling zombies in order to get a lively look on the film. So when/if black-and-white movies are colorized, it's counterproductive to restore the way they really looked. The new color has to reflect the way their creators wanted them to look, and there usually is no way to know that but guess. Coloring process is not about ""conversion"" at all. It's an artistic process in which color is added by coloring artist as they see fit and to match to their taste."
How was Looney Tunes originally watched?,"They were shown in cinemas before a main feature, just as Pixar films have a short beforehand today. Typically a cinema would show a film, some cartoons, and some newsreel on a constant loop. People would come in and then leave once it got round to where they started. There's a scene in Who Framed Roger Rabbit? demonstrating this."
Is the loudness of a movie in the theater set by the theater or by the publisher/studio?,"The overall answer is it can depend, but it's usually set by the movie theater. Unless the studio has requested an optimal volume range for a movie, the theater is free to set the volume at whatever level they want. Disney was fairly notorious for this when I was a projectionist (from 2007 to 2011). They would include a ""guide card"" for things like bulb brightness and suggested volume level for many of their movies, especially animated features. They would even send in secret viewers to rate our presentation and provide us with feedback, and would send us little gifts if we had ""perfect presentation"". Otherwise if people complained a movie is too loud or not loud enough, if they informed someone on the ground they could let projection know, and we'd take it up or down a couple notches. However, loud can also be a fairly generic thing to describe. Movies can naturally be louder or quieter than others, either in full or from one moment to another, and that's all depending on how the sound was mixed and applied to the film. Used to be a notorious issue in the US with commercials being dramatically louder than the TV shows they were advertising on, that the Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation Act (or CALM Act) was passed. However, as with most regulation, there are ways around it. Naturally, audio is also a relative experience: what may be too loud for one person could be too quiet for another. For people who are hard of hearing, many theaters offer special headphones that offer an amplified audio feed for them so they can hear a louder version of the audio without making things too loud for others. There's even options for people who are completely deaf to provide closed captioning of dialog, or for blind patrons to offer descriptive audio to help explain what's happening on screen. Not every theater has these services, though."
Why are so many American (spy) movies set in Europe?,"First of all, many of the actual activities involving espionage happened, originally, against the backdrop of the Cold War.  Obviously, having more different nations in a more compressed space gives a lot more chances for interactions. If we take a U.S. spy, Jason Bourne, and send him on a mission, we must, by definition, deploy him to take actions against foreign agents and foreign governments.  The genre can be described as ""international espionage,"" so we need OTHER countries.... so, Europe.  Middle East is also popular. However, I do think this is your own Euro-centric viewpoint. A huge portion of the Jason Bourne films splits time between him tracking down his past in Europe, but also coming back to the USA, to infiltrate the CIA and its training facilities. Here are some spy or international terrorism-based movie themes that pit US intelligence services against ""bad guys"" that are almost entirely based in the USA (most of these are actually pretty good, too): (I'm not sure about the ratio of USA domestic to foreign in those last two, but I think they're set mostly in the USA) Many movies in the US backdrop focus more on law enforcement and FBI because our spy agencies are prohibited by law from performing espionage against domestic targets, so you get more of a law enforcement angle, like in the movie Betrayed about an FBI agent infiltrating a domestic terrorist organization."
Has there been a movie or a TV show where an abortion was portrayed without negative connotations?,"A somewhat recent romantic comedy has actually been lauded for its treatment of this subject: Obvious Child from 2014 starring comedian Jenny Slate. From a Slate article: In the new movie Obvious Child, twentysomething stand-up comic Donna gets pregnant after a drunken one-night stand, loses her job, attempts to schedule an abortion at her local Planned Parenthood clinic, and—cherry on top—discovers that the only available appointment is on Feb. 14. Turns out, it’s the perfect day: This is a romantic comedy where the girl gets an abortion and gets the guy. Along the way, she doesn’t even have a change of heart, contract a nasty infection, or succumb to a tragic death. That makes Obvious Child a run-of-the-mill story for a woman in America but an exceedingly rare tale for a woman on film. [...] Obvious Child executes [a] remarkable feat. While other films that touch on abortion conspire to neutralize a woman's choice, or else punish her for it, Obvious Child never dwells on Donna’s decision. (This is no “Donna’s Dilemma.”) Instead, it plays with all the other choices inherent in the abortion decision—like how much to involve the man in the choice, how to tell your mom, and how to talk about it all publicly—and it does it all with humor and poignancy without getting glib. The article details the contrasting, stark depiction of the subject in previous works and its causes, but also contains another somewhat positive portrayal: A plot from the sitcom Maude in 1972: Until Obvious Child, the best, most honest portrayal of abortion on screen aired in 1972 (after the procedure was legalized in New York, but before Roe took it nationwide), when Maude featured a two-episode abortion plotline titled “Maude’s Dilemma,” in which 47-year-old Maude becomes unexpectedly pregnant and spends a full television hour brashly debating every aspect of her choice with friends and family—including her age, her financial situation, her temperament, her husband’s feelings, and her daughter’s concerns. She ultimately chooses abortion, but not before the show wrings all possible feminist statements and dark laughs from the predicament. Cristina’s decision to have an abortion on Grey’s Anatomy in season 8. From the LA Times: Cristina is not a teenager, or a rape or an incest victim. She is not poor with eight kids and an abusive husband or suffering from mental illness. She does not have a rare disease that makes pregnancy a physical risk. Unlike Maude, she isn't an ""older"" woman with mid-life concerns. Cristina is married, healthy, financially stable and of prime childbearing years. She chose to have an abortion because she did not want to have a child. [...] [She] did not seem particularly agonized. She seemed, as she said she was, scared and sad, but she knew that she did not want to have a baby. Jane’s mother’s decision to have it on Jane the Virgin in season 3. From Vanity Fair: Jane [the Virgin] handled the subject with a rare attitude: empathetic, but casual. Viewers don’t really watch Xiomara grapple and agonize over the decision, or even see her go to the clinic. In the time gap between the season premiere and episode two, Xiomara has an abortion off-screen. Instead of focusing on the decision itself, the episode focuses on how her family reacts—and ultimately overcomes their different perspectives. "
Do I need knowledge of American culture and history to enjoy Forrest Gump?,"Forrest Gump as a person has quite the strong development in character, but that is not the main strength of the movie. Its true power lies in the enormous amount of nods to American history and the way Forrest experiences (and influences) them. Now, I'm neither an American nor old enough to have witnessed these events first-hand, but I do know a thing or two about Watergate, Martin Luther King, Apple, 'Nam, Elvis etc. In my experience, this is a requirement to really enjoy this movie. Of course, you can always turn it around: Watch the movie, find out the significance of scenes you don't get, and learn something in the process!"
How do film makers record the President of the United States?,"Does the White House schedule a day where film makers submit texts they want the acting president to say and possibly pay for it? Pretty much anything the President says in public is recorded on film.  Editing real footage of presidential statement into movies is an old practise. It's just a matter of finding the right quote which, out of context, fits the plot of the movie in question. You will usually find this referred to as ""archive footage"" For instance that clip is taken from this announcement on Hurricane Irene around the 1.20 mark: 

 "
Why aren't the characters floating two levels down?,"It is slightly odd, because other senses appear to be able to penetrate more than one layer, although they are severely attenuated. For example, when they are in Level 2 - someone says ""did you feel that, was that turbulence on the plane"" (which is Level 0), to which Eames says ""no, too close, Yusuf's driving probably"".  He doesn't say - ""of course not, you wouldn't feel anything down here, must be Yusuf's driving"".  Then there is the Edith Piaf song used to synchronize the kick.  That is played by Yusuf into Arthur's ears in Level 1, yet is heard (faintly) in Level 3.  Then there is the 'second kick' that they experience when the van hits the water, this is felt in Level 3 - showing that something should be felt of the free-fall even at that layer. If senses are attenuated with each layer it would be more realistic to think that somewhat less than free-fall would be experienced in Level 2, and some effect would be experienced in Level 3.  There is too much discrepancy between the total free-fall experienced by Arthur, and the apparent normality of skiing down a mountain that the team experience in Level 3. Still doesn't spoil my enjoyment of it though."
Why did Warner Bros spend $25 million to CGI out Henry Cavill's mustache?,"They shoot Justice League without Henry Cavil's mustache, and after the shooting he signed in for MI6, which required his mustache so he grew a mustache. And that's when tragedy happened. Zack Snyder, Justice League's director, stepped down due to a family tragedy. In response, Joss Whedon stepped up to helm the film and also called for a few reshoots ($25 million worth of reshoots, actually).  Sadly, Paramount would not allow Cavill to shave the mustache he had grown for Mission Impossible.  So WB had to remove it in CGI.

"Why is Discovery One covered in sulphur in ""2010: The Year We Make Contact""?","There are an absurd number of volcanoes on Io, and they spew out an enormous amount of sulfur.  The low gravity and thin atmosphere allows the ejecta to escape Io's atmosphere and reach space.  As a result, Io's orbital path is like a donut-shaped cloud of sulfur dust (called a torus).  Jupiter's super-powered magnetosphere pulls up more sulfur from Io's atmosphere itself, and ionizes all of this sulfur, making it stick to any neutrally charged surfaces in the vicinity.   


Io's surface is riddled with volcanoes; the large red circle in the southern hemisphere is a ring of sulfur surrounding the volcano Pele (more images of Pele below)   The sulfur comes primarily from Io itself - specifically, the enormous number of active volcanoes (at least 400, at last count) that dot the surface of the moon.  The abundance of volcanic activity on Io is primarily the result of the tremendous tidal forces caused by Jupiter's immense gravitational pull.  
A small sample of some of Io's known volcanoes Several volcanoes produce plumes of sulfur and sulfur dioxide that climb as high as 500 km (300 mi) above the surface. Io's surface is also dotted with more than 100 mountains that have been uplifted by extensive compression at the base of Io's silicate crust... Most of Io's surface is composed of extensive plains coated with sulfur and sulfur-dioxide frost. 
Jupiter's moon Io, as photographed by the Galileo probe.  The varying colors are mostly different kinds of sulfur (photo's colors altered to better represent what Io would actually look like to the human eye). Io's volcanism is responsible for many of its unique features. Its volcanic plumes and lava flows produce large surface changes and paint the surface in various subtle shades of yellow, red, white, black, and green, largely due to allotropes and compounds of sulfur.
  -  Wikipedia 
One of Io's best known volcanoes, Pele, and the ring of sulfur it has produced (for a picture of a massive plume of ejecta coming from one of Pele's eruptions, see below)  Not only is the surface of the moon covered in volcanic sulfur dust, the atmosphere is full of sulfur spewed out by volcanic activity as well: When the twin probes Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 passed by Io in 1979, their more advanced imaging system allowed for far more detailed images. Voyager 1 flew past Io on 5 March 1979 from a distance of 20,600 km (12,800 mi). Shortly after the encounter, Voyager navigation engineer Linda A. Morabito noticed a plume emanating from the surface in one of the images.  Analysis of other Voyager 1 images showed nine such plumes scattered across the surface, proving that Io was volcanically active.  This conclusion was predicted in a paper published shortly before the Voyager 1 encounter by Stan Peale, Patrick Cassen, and R. T. Reynolds. The authors calculated that Io's interior must experience significant tidal heating caused by its orbital resonance with Europa and Ganymede (see the ""Tidal heating"" section for a more detailed explanation of the process).  Data from this flyby showed that the surface of Io is dominated by sulfur and sulfur dioxide frosts. These compounds also dominate its thin atmosphere...
  -  Wikipedia The escape velocity (the speed necessary for an object to leave an astronomical object) of Io is relatively low1, because its gravity is only 1/6 that of Earth's, and the atmosphere is very thin (Earth's atmosphere is roughly 200,000,000 times denser than Io's).  Taken together, these facts mean that when a volcano on Io erupts, the plume of ejecta can easily escape the atmosphere and enter space.  By way of comparison, if we somehow moved the famous ""Old Faithful"" geyser from Yellowstone National Park to the surface of Io, it's plumes of water would reach heights of ~37 kilometers (23 miles) - compared with its actual height of 106-185 feet (32-56 meters) here on Earth. Enormous volcanic plumes on Io, leaving the atmosphere and spraying out into space (the third image shows an eruption from the volcano Pele2, the subject of another photo posted above):



 
Volcanic plume on Io rising 330 km (210 mi) above the surace of the moon In real life, there is something known as a ""flux tube"" between Jupiter and Io. A flux tube is a generally tube-like (cylindrical) region of space containing a magnetic field, such that the field at the side surfaces is parallel to those surfaces. Both the cross-sectional area of the tube and the field contained may vary along the length of the tube, but the magnetic flux is always constant... As used in astrophysics, a flux tube generally has a larger magnetic field and other properties that differ from the surrounding space. They are commonly found around stars, including the Sun, which has many flux tubes of around 300 km diameter. Sunspots are also associated with larger flux tubes of 2500 km diameter. Some planets also have flux tubes. A well-known example is the flux tube between Jupiter and its moon Io.
  -  Wikipedia This particular flux tube contains a significant amount of ionized sulfur: 
An electric current of five million amperes flows along Io’s flux tube. It connects Io to the upper atmosphere of Jupiter, like a giant umbilical cord. The plasma torus is centered near Io’s orbit, and it is about as thick as Jupiter is wide. The torus is filled with energetic sulfur and oxygen ions that have a temperature of about 100 thousand kelvin.  
Source:  Seven Wonders of the Gas Giants and Their Moons By Ron Miller Jupiter's magnetic field - or magnetosphere - is obscenely powerful: The stronger the magnetic field, the larger the magnetosphere. Some 20,000 times stronger than Earth's magnetic field, Jupiter's magnetic field creates a magnetosphere so large it begins to avert the solar wind almost 3 million kilometers before it reaches Jupiter. The magnetosphere extends so far past Jupiter it sweeps the solar wind as far as the orbit of Saturn.
  -  University of Colorado at Boulder:  Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics 
Schematic of Jupiter's magnetosphere and the components influenced by Io (near the center of the image): the plasma torus (in red), the neutral cloud (in yellow), the flux tube (in green), and magnetic field lines (in blue). This overpowered magnetosphere sucks up gas and dust from Io's atmosphere at an absurd rate of ~1 tonne per second.  The material - predominantly oxygen and sulfur - is ionized by the enormous amounts of electrical energy (400,000 volts, 3 million amperes, and about 2,000,000,000,000 watts - roughly equivalent to all the electricity produced by humans) thrown off by Jupiter.   Some of the ionized sulfur is actually caught in Jupiter's magnetic field and drawn back to the gas giant, where it strikes the gases at Jupiter's poles and causes aurorae:  When the film begins, a mission is being arranged to reach the Discovery One, which ran into trouble in 2001:  A Space Odyssey.  Time is of the essence, because the derelict spacecraft is adrift and will soon crash into one of Jupiter's moons - namely, Io. NASA is clearly interested in finding out what happened to Discovery One and her crew, and because the ship is about to be smashed to pieces, they have to get there in a hurry. The fact that the ship is going to crash into Io implies that it is probably in an unstable orbit around Io.  This would mean that the Discovery One has been floating around in the flux tube for several years, surrounded by the massive clouds of ionized sulfur.   It wouldn't even need to be this close, though - studies of one of Jupiter's other moons, Europa (also an important plot element in the movie), have found that there are chemical reactions taking place on Europa's icy surface.  These reactions involve large amounts of ionized sulfur and oxygen, and it is thought that the sulfur and oxygen on Europa were originally spewed out by Io's volcanoes. The ship would be likely to accumulate a coating of sulfur dust from being relatively close to Io, regardless of other factors.  However, our own real world spacecraft - for example, the International Space Station - are designed in such a way that the hull is essentially ""grounded"" to prevent massive problems from electrical charge buildup.   The grounding of the space station's photovoltaic arrays (the negative end of the arrays are grounded to the structure) place the ISS at large negative electrical potentials (-160 volts DC) relative to the ambient space plasma when the arrays are producing power. In order to avoid sputtering and to lessen other undesired results of this grounding scheme, plasma contactor devices in the hull emit a steady stream of plasma from the station to raise its potential to within a few volts of the ambient plasma. The plasma contactor acts as an electrical ground rod to connect the space station structure to the local environment and harmlessly dissipate the structure charges. GRC engineers designed, manufactured, and tested the hollow cathode assembly, which performs this function by converting a small supply of gas into ions and electrons and discharging this stream to space. The stream carries with it the excess electrons that created the surface charge.
  -  NASA We might assume that the Discovery One employs some form of hull grounding as well.  If so, then the ship would become a veritable magnet, actively pulling the ionized sulfur to its hull, much like an electrostatic paint spraying system. An electrostatic paint spray system is a highly efficient technology for the application of paint to specific workpieces. Negatively charged atomized paint particles and a grounded workpiece create an electrostatic field that draws the paint particle to the workpiece... Because the charged particles are attracted to the grounded workpiece, overspray is significantly reduced. Paint particles that pass a workpiece can be attracted to and deposited on the back of the piece. This phenomena is known as ""wrap"".
  -  Source Probably.  The only spacecraft that have been through the flux tube and torus where the sulfur is most abundant are long-distance, one-way probes like the Voyager and Galileo probes.  We obviously can't see them to check the hull's color, but Voyager 1 ran into some problems in the flux tube: As noted by Scudder et al. [1981], within the Io plasma torus where electron densities ne exceeded 1000 cm -3, the spacecraft charged to a negative potential. When the spacecraft becomes negatively charged, the return current relation used by Scudder et al. [1981] is no longer valid, and some other other means must be used to estimate ne and the spacecraft potential Φsc.
  -  University of Colorado at Boulder: Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics Considering the fact that the probe became so negatively charged that the instruments no longer function properly, and when the negative charge was acquired by flying through ionized sulfur, chances are the probe picked up a coating of sulfur - and that's just from passing through the area for a few hours, not lingering there for years. When a spacecraft spends nine years floating around in a cloud of ionized volcanic sulfur, it's going to end up covered in yellow, foul-smelling dust.  And this:
 Becomes this:
 1Earth's escape velocity is ~11 kilometers per second; Io's is ~2.5 kilometers per second 2The largest plumes produced by Io's volcanoes are called ""Pele-type plumes"" because Pele's eruptions are so enormous.  Pele-type plumes can reach heights of 300-500 km (190-310 mi).  A plume 500 km high is about 1/7th the diameter of the entire moon;  by way of comparison, if Earth's volcanoes produced plumes with a height equal to 1/7th of its diameter, the plumes would be 1,820 km (1,130 mi) high. The ring of sulfur around Pele is 1,000 kilometers (620 mi) wide - about 1/3 the diameter of the moon;  this would be like a ring of sulfur 4,247 km (2,638 mi) wide on earth - about the size of the United States.

Is this balcony with a protruding gargoyle a real place?,"Whether each of those shots is real or a model on green screen is probably not at issue. The building itself is real.
It's the Chrysler Building, on Manhattan Island, New York City. I guess the reasons it appears so often in movies are It could be one of the most photogenic buildings in existence. There aren't too many true art deco skyscrapers around. It's got gargoyles and a hell of a drop! Even if they're not on the building itself, they sure do like to show it in the background…     Just for a bit of added anecdote and because I love this photo, this is Oscar Graubner's picture of the building's official photographer — Margaret Bourke-White atop the Chrysler Building c. 1934. This one is definitely not done on green screen!  After comments: She's holding her camera — they didn't have iPhones in those days ;) Here's another pic showing greater detail.
For the camera buffs, I think it might be a Graflex*, an early SLR [Single Lens Reflex] camera, which is why she looks into the top of it to see out of the actual lens on the front, but I'm really not certain of the model… * Link is to Google Images search "
What rules govern how TV show opening credits are structured?,"The rules for how the order of credits is produced is very long and convoluted. They also vary from show to show, so for any one ""rule of thumb"" it's almost guaranteed you can find an exception on the air right now on some channel. The basic guidelines that most shows follow most of the time are drawn from the rules for the various industry guilds. In the case of actors, that would be SAG (the WGA and DGA would determine how/when a writer or director get credited.) The Wikipedia articles linked in a few comments/answers gives a basic rundown of all the guild rules that have to be followed in the ""typical"" credits sequence. Note that movies opening and closing credit sequences differ a lot from television ones (in particular, you rarely see the name of the production company in a TV show's opening credits.)  However, there's a lot of variation on the basic theme, because the placement and styling in the credits sequence is often part of an actor's individual contract with the studio. Studios will rearrange the credits or give certain actors special consideration in the credits as part of the negotiations.  The basic flow of credits is as you mentioned: core actors first, followed by guest actors, followed by a handful of top-level production staff. In TV, it's rare to have a full set of closing credits the way you have in movies, where the entire cast would appear with their character names, for simple time reasons: they would take a really long time that could instead be used for commercials. (In fact, many networks now show split-screen closing credits side by side with a promo for the upcoming program.) So those credits are usually limited to production-level people and companies, copyright/legal notices, and other minutia. Why a particular actor gets a particular spot in the credits is mostly a matter of PR, and explains some of the variations you mention in your question: In general, having a unique style of credit (e.g. being specifically associated with a character) is a bonus given out to special guest stars and particularly important actors that lets them stand out from the rest of the cast. This is something a well-known or highly-priced actor would negotiate as a condition of their appearance. They even negotiate down to the exact wording, which can include ""guest"" vs. ""special guest"", are they ""starring"" or ""appearing"", etc (I have seen shows that had multiple guest stars, each billed slightly differently). Another key distinction to make is between series regulars and recurring guest stars. A series regular will still appear in the opening credits, and be given credit for the episode, even if they don't actually appear in the episode.  The general idea here is that a series regular, even if they aren't in a particular episode, is contractually required to be available to appear in that episode. A recurring guest actor, on the other hand, is typically contracted to appear in only a specific number of episodes, and can usually skip a particular episode if they have prior commitments. A recurring guest star, with lower billing, may actually get more screen time than a series regular that gets top billing. This happened in House in seasons 4-6, where Olivia Wilde, Kal Penn and Peter Jacobson were given lower ""Also Starring"" billing, while rarely-appearing Jennifer Morrison and Jesse Spencer continued to be billed as series regulars. As always, this was entirely down to the contracts the latter two had with the show."
Do they really crash super cars in action movies?,"It's very broad to say yes or no. But no, they don't. They use shells, stripped down frames, with standard engines, but with the appropriate paneling to make it look like the real thing. The inside shots are done either with rentals or CGI, but the crashes are the dummies as you put it. All for budget reasons. A replica is only a fraction of the real thing. Note, the real thing doesn't have truss framing in it:

 At least, that's how it was done for the Need For Speed movie. See chapter two here."
Do Star Trek characters wearing red shirts have the highest death rate on the original show?,"Red shirts have a skewed death rate in TOS due to the nature of their job. The Security role is handled by Ops, which all wear red shirts (Scotty, the engineer, is also Ops). So red shirts die in higher number because Security officers are at a higher risk. They assume guard duties and the dangers inherent to that role.  In TNG and beyond, the color structure has changed. Command has become the red shirts, and ops has become gold. In TNG, there is a higher number of gold shirt deaths. Tasha Yar being a prime example. Again,  it is because Security is gold.  That’s according to Matthew Barsalou, who debunked the red shirt curse for Significance Magazine by mathematically breaking down the death rates, by uniform color, of characters on the original Star Trek. A simple pie chart reveals 55 total deaths and, yes, red shirts perished in frightening numbers. A whopping 24 died, compared to 9 in yellow/gold command and 7 in blue, with 15 crossing into the final frontier in unidentified colors. However, it’s all a matter of perspective and percentages. There were 430 crewmen aboard the Enterprise, 239 of them in engineering, security or operations, and all wore red. So, in reality, they had a decent survival rate, and it was, statistically speaking – courtesy of a little something called Bayes’ theorem -- the folks in gold who were more likely to meet their maker. - See more at: http://www.startrek.com/article/did-redshirts-really-die-more-often-on-tos#sthash.wUlkpts5.dpuf So while red shirts in TOS are statistically safer, based on ship crew complement, they suffer a higher on screen death count. Higher number, lower percentage. "
Why did Neo have powers in the real world?,"The main explanation I've seen, and that seems to be pretty official, was that the plug thing Neo has in the back of his head worked as a wireless device. Well, as you will read below, this isn't actually specified like this, but since the source speaks of the ""brain becoming a  wireless connection"", it seems the safest thing to assume. In any case, no magic is involved. In the IMDB FAQ page for Matrix Revolutions, we see the question: What explanation does the movie give for Neo now having his powers in the real world? And the answer is (emphasis mine). The machines in the real world are all connected to a ""singular consciousness"", the birth of Artificial Intelligence described by Morpheus in the first Matrix film. This consciousness is otherwise known as ""The Source"". The machine connection is a remote one or some sort of wireless signal. Having touched The Source (i.e. meeting with the Architect) and having the data needed to reboot the Matrix, Neo is, at this point, simultaneously in possession of his human brain but also connected to the singular consciousness. In other words, his is also now a wireless connection. Hence the reason Neo says, ""Something's different. I can feel them."" The machines are all separate entities but all connected to this one Source. Now, Neo is connected as well. He is thereby able to harness this power and stop the Sentinels. However, Neo wasn't ready to handle the signal surge at the end of Reloaded and collapsed in a comatose state, no longer in control of just where this wireless signal would be directed. The signal (Neo's residual self-image) is then captured and held in a program limbo derived from the Source but undetected as an existing realm, so to speak. This limbo (the ""Mobil Ave"" train station) was created by the Trainman (Bruce Spence), a program in service to the Merovingian (Lambert Wilson). This connection forged by Neo's visit to the Architect (Helmut Bakaitis) and his subsequent decision to return to the real world made him, unknowingly, unique. Neo became simultaneously human and machine in a sense."
Why didn't Voldemort create a seventh Horcrux not knowing Harry was one?,"You made the same mistake as Harry in Harry Potter and The Half Blood Prince. As JAD said, Voldemort wanted to split his soul in seven, not create seven Horcruxes (emphasis mine): “[...] You heard him, Harry: ‘Wouldn’t it be better, make you stronger, to have your soul in more pieces... isn’t seven the most powerfully magical number...’ Isn’t seven the most powerfully magical number. Yes, I think the idea of a seven-part soul would greatly appeal to Lord Voldemort.” “He made seven Horcruxes?” said Harry, horror-struck, while several of 
  the portraits on the walls made similar noises of shock mid outrage. “But they could be anywhere in the world — hidden — buried or invisible —” “I am glad to see you appreciate the magnitude of the problem,” said Dumbledore calmly. “But firstly, no, Harry, not seven Horcruxes: six. The seventh part of his soul, however maimed, resides inside his regenerated body. [...]”"
Why didn't Bilbo become a creature like Gollum?,"First of all, the possession of the ring didn't stay entirely without effect even to Bilbo. Remember how everyone was surprised at Bilbo's apparently unaged looks compared to his actual age (and his pretty fast aging once he didn't have the ring anymore). And also remember his reluctance to give up the ring (into which he had to be seriously ""persuaded"" by Gandalf) and his ""outburst"" in Rivendell when he caught a glimpse of it on Frodo's neck (a scene that made me jump in my seat on the first view and that still terrifies me whenever I see it). Those effects might very well have worsened if Bilbo would have kept the ring for longer.  But another important aspect is, that Gollum is a morally weaker person to begin with. After all the ring for him was won in an act of evil in the first place, murdering his friend for the ""precious"". That is something we could surmise Bilbo wouldn't have done, as evident from the mercy he showed Gollum -- a supposedly disgusting creature he didn't even know -- when he had him at the point of his sword after stealing his ring. But he saw what a miserable creature Gollum was and felt compassion for him. Then add to this, that Gollum is also pretty much a product of his circumstances. When he killed his friend he became a social outcast, which even more contributed to his further moral degradation and his alienation from ""normal"" social life. His split personality might on the one hand be just a natural result of his loneliness but might on the other hand as well be a way to cope with his deeds, first and foremost the murder of his friend, either by said friend manifesting as the second personality or just as an attempt to blame his deeds on that ""other person"" living inside of him. And the fact that he became a cave-dweller far from the sunlight eating raw fish and orcs and whatever vile creatures might have contributed to his further physical deterioration. Bilbo on the other hand still lived a happy life as an accepted member of a blooming social environment so that the ring couldn't unfold its whole potential on him, but after all we also know that if the ring has anything, it's patience."
How did Indy know not to look into the Ark?,"There was a deleted scene that explained it: A plot element involving the Ark of the Covenant was cut from the film and is only hinted at during the finale when the Ark is opened.  Basically, there were 2 rules about the Ark not mentioned in the final cut of the film: This is first explained in additional dialogue for the scene when Indy and Sallah visit Imam. Before translating the writings on the headpiece that give the height of the Staff of Ra, Imam warns Indy not to touch the Ark or look at it when it is opened.  [Source] The next scene involving this Ark subplot is when Sallah and Indy remove the Ark from the Well of the Souls. When Sallah first sees it he reaches out to touch it. Indy stops him before he does and reminds him of Imam's warning. Then they insert long poles through each side of the Ark to lift it out of its crypt.  [Source] Notice that nobody ever touches the Ark throughout the rest of the film until the finale. And from the Bible (King James Version): 1 Samuel 6:19:
   And he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the Lord, even he smote of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men... 2 Samuel 6:6-7
And when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it. And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God."
How is Team Scooby Doo (Mystery Inc.) funded?,"According to Scooby-Doo Behind the Scenes (released in 1998; see Wikiquote), the initial money to start out was given to them by Daphne’s dad: Daphne: ""Well, Daddy gave us the money to start off. (shows an image of the check that first financed Mystery Inc.) We didn't even have a car, so we gave our parents gas money to drive us around."" 

 In addition, many of the different canons have shown them having jobs.  (In some of these they are adults though.) From the Wikia page for Scooby-Doo: "
Why do British sitcoms have much fewer episodes than American ones?,"From BBC America - Five Bizarre Things About British Television: The Six Episode Season
  Most British drama or comedy shows have a very short season. The classic amount for comedies is just six episodes per series – The Office being a prime example – and there’s one very good reason for this.  American comedy is a producer’s medium, in which an idea is worked up, characters developed and early scripts written, and then the show is handed over to a larger group of writers to flesh out into actual scripts.  British comedy is a writer’s medium. The scripts are almost always written and developed by one or two people, then taken to production. Graham Linehan, the writer of Father Ted and The IT Crowd, even directs his own scripts, which is a LOT of work.  From TIME Magazine - What the U.S. Can Learn from British TV: There are underlying economic reasons for the two different models.  The goal of almost any American commercial series is to air at least 100 episodes, because that’s when it can be sold into syndication and aired as reruns on other stations or networks. That’s where the real money is.  But the BBC is publicly financed, so not every show has to earn its investment back with a multiseason run. From TV Tropes - British Brevity: British shows usually have a fairly small creative team.  It's not uncommon for one person to single-handedly write every episode of a show, as Steven Moffat did with Coupling, or David Renwick with Jonathan Creek.  There's more pressure to succeed, and less of a chance to make a lasting impression or develop long plot arcs. Ruin two episodes and that's a third of a season down the tubes. Some American shows that start off weak can grow their beard when the show would have long been over in the UK. On the other hand, British shows tend to have the entire series filmed before broadcast, so shows are rarely canceled mid-season, or affected by events like a writers' strike. Another thing to keep in mind is that the US has 114 million TV households, whereas the UK has 26 million. Fewer viewers means there is less money to be made. And less money means fewer episodes."
Why did Morpheus tell Trinity to stay off the freeway?,"Since agents can inhabit any ""bluepill"" person in the Matrix, the freeway poses a few issues. Yes, you can move quickly from one distant point to another, but that's of no benefit to Trinity, Morpheus, or any other awoken Matrix users. On the freeway you're locked into a narrow corridor with exits only every mile or more, and any car near you can become a weapon in the hands of an agent.  In the first film, we see that the preferred movement method of Morpheus, Trinity & friends is to keep their business relegated to places in the dense city, and when escaping agents, try to lose them in alleys or maze-like building interiors. Going up roofs or around corners, their goal is to put obstacles between them & the agents as quickly as possible, because all they need is a spare moment to find an exit while the agents are busy trying to find them again."
"What is the purpose of this ""red room"" in Stranger Things?","That room is called a darkroom, and it's part of the photographic printing process. A darkroom is a workshop used by photographers working with photographic film to make prints and carry out other associated tasks. It is a room that can be made completely dark to allow the processing of the light-sensitive photographic materials, including film and photographic paper. And for why it's red: When making black-and-white prints, a safelight is commonly used to illuminate the work area. Since the majority of black-and-white papers are sensitive to only blue, or to blue and green light, a red- or amber-colored light can be safely used without exposing the paper.  But in the digital photographic age, darkrooms are getting outdated, as digital printing is safer than chemicals used in the previous process. It's still not an extinct process and still used by some professional photographers. For further interesting readings: It’s Time to Accept That Your Darkroom is Dead Do Photographers Still Use Darkrooms?"
Why didn't Hans Gruber know what Mr. Takagi looked like?,"Though the movie does not provide clear evidence about whether Hans had recognized Takagi on sight, I have always assumed that Hans had a good idea which man was Takagi, but had to confirm, hence the dialogue.  It seems likely that Hans would have looked at a picture (or pictures) of Takagi in advance -- but looking at a picture doesn't guarantee he would have easily recognized Takagi when meeting him for the first time, in a group.  In any case, the dialogue also happens to do a great job developing Hans's character: it reveals he is (1) European, (2) an intelligent speaker, (3) thorough in his preparation, and (4) confidently in charge of the current situation.  So from Hans's perspective, the dialogue is indeed a chilling and bad-ass way to introduce himself to everyone at the party he just crashed. And similarly, from the screenwriters' perspective, the dialogue is an ideal introduction of Hans to the audience."
Why did the Night King attack the furthest target first?,"You've pointed at a good flaw. Drogon would have been an equally valid target. But there are some options here as to why the NK chose Viserion over Drogon. Although the ice spear did penetrate Viserion's skin with relative ease, Drogon is a considerably larger and stronger dragon.  We don't know much about the ice spear and whether it has any magical qualities that help with killing dragons. But given that Qyburn's ballista would make for an effective weapon too, I'm going to assume that dragon scales can be penetrated by brute force alone, without any magic. The ice spear was thrown with a tremendous amount of force. But maybe killing Drogon was a stretch. He's a bigger dragon, and looks to be more armored as well. Maybe the Night King wasn't sure that it'd kill Drogon, and therefore he focused on the smaller, weaker dragons first. Viserion was hit, couldn't fly anymore, and hit the ice with a considerable impact. When Dany flies away later, you can see that the mark Viserion left on the ice is by far the largest, thus showing that Viserion made a high velocity, high impact landing. Drogon was on the ground. Even if he were to be hit in the same fashion as Viserion, he wouldn't hit the ground with such an impact, thus not knocking him out or killing him on impact. This may give Drogon (or Danaerys) the time to deal with the spear.
Viserion did lose a lot of blood very quickly; but Drogon is comparatively larger and more armored, would bleed less, and is maybe able to shrug it off more easily (similar to why stabbing a dog-sized animal with a dagger will kill it, but stabbing an elephant-sized animal will only wound it) There is another thing to consider here. The spear hit Viserion under the wing. I'm not sure how much of a marksman the Night King is, but he hit Viserion in a place that would prevent him from flying, which is exactly how he should have taken Viserion down. It's also likely that the dragons are less armored near their wings, because armoring would chafe them during flying. They need a fair range of movement with their wings.   This is pure speculation, but if we assume that the Night King was aiming for a weak spot near the base of the wing, Drogon would not be a viable target as he was using his wings to rest on the ground, and therefore covering it. The weak spot would not be visible/hittable by the Night King. Even if he could pierce Drogon's wing to hit the weak spot anyway, he had no line of sight to the weak spot and would be guesstimating his throw. Since this theory assumes that the Night King was aiming precisely, that makes Drogon a difficult target to accurately hit (exactly on the weak spot).   Comparatively, the flying dragons were better targets, as their weak spots are more exposed to those below them. Looking at the linked image in GhotiandChips' answer, from the Night King's perspective, most of what he could hit on Drogon seems to either be pretty well armored, or invisible due to the wing covering line of sight to it. It should have been clear to the Night King that Drogon was the transport dragon, carrying Dany and soon also the others. This slows Drogon down. He is also not able to just up and leave, because he can't leave Dany or the others, who will be quickly overwhelmed by the wights. The Night King wasn't trying to kill one dragon, he was trying to kill multiple dragons. He obviously did not stop at killing one. Though we didn't see him throw a third spear, nor target Rhaegal specifically, it seems fair to assume that he was trying to kill all the dragons. If he kills Drogon first, Rhaegal and Viserion can immediately fly away. They are already in the air, mobile, and they don't have to take people along with them.
If he kills a flying dragon first, Drogon can't just fly away. Not only will it take him more time to leave (due to not flying already), he also needs to load people, and presumably fly more safely so that the people do not fall off (evidenced by Jorah almost falling off when Drogon dodged the spear). If you're trying to kill as much as you can, start by killing those who can run away to safety quickly, and kill the slow ones later."
What actually happens when a telephone rings in a movie or TV show?,"It depends on the director and the crew's capability, as well as the actor's ability to act with or without an audible cue. You can have a regular phone hooked up to a regular phone line or PBX and then ring it by calling it or it's extension. You can have the actors act as though it rung, answer it, and add it in post production. You can buy phones that ring on cue. You can buy devices that ring phones for you by applying the correct signals on the phone line. You can use an active, real cell phone in the scene and call it. You can use a real cell phone but only pretend to answer it and add sound in the post. You can use a fake cell phone with a screen dummy that allows both sound and CGI to be added in post so the display operates as the director wants it to. A lot of this comes down to the effect the director wants, the capability of the actors, and the capability of the effects crews that would be involved. There are always other methods, this is just a simple overview."
Why was there a robot in Rocky IV?,"Some interesting info can be found here.   Basically, to summarize the article, Stallone discovered the company that produced the robot was using it as a tool to help autistic children.  One of Stallone's children is autistic, so he became enamored with the robot and offered to write a part for it in the next Rocky movie.  Apparently there was more scripted around building the relationship between Paulie and the robot, but it was scrapped. "
Banner's control of Hulk in Avengers,"My theory is this:  Banner can already control The Hulk at the beginning of Avengers This is shown when he is about to show his 'secret' to Black Widow the first time.  They are then interrupted (I forget by what already) before he can show her (presumably, his instant transformation).  It is then shown (in a very epic fashion) that he can turn into The Hulk at will when the giant Chitauri is approaching them stating to Widow ""I'm always angry"". However, when Loki was escaping and caused the floor to pop out from underneath him and Widow, he then loses this control due to the sudden nature of the event and therefore doesn't have full control over The Hulk, hence the battle with Thor."
Why was there a 14 year gap between The Incredibles and The Incredibles 2?,"For writer-director Brad Bird, it all came down to story. “The thing is, many sequels are cash grabs,” Bird told reporters during a recent press event to promote Incredibles 2. “There’s a saying in the business that I can’t stand, where they go, ‘if you don’t make another one, you’re leaving money on the table.’ It’s like, money on the table is not what makes me get up in the morning; making something that people are gonna enjoy a hundred years from now, that’s what gets me up. So if it were a cash grab, we would not have taken fourteen years – it makes no financial sense to wait this long – it’s purely that we had a story we wanted to tell.” Bird admitted that the proliferation of superhero properties in recent years has made it much harder to tell an original story; the first film debuted before Pixar’s parent company, Disney, purchased Marvel, and predated Iron Man by four years - meaning that the new film is entering a very different cinematic landscape from its predecessor. There's a fair bit more in the source article Why Did Incredibles 2 Take So Long? Brad Bird Explains the Sequel's Delay Some of which also relates to multiple rewrites concerning the villain storyline and trying to make I2 more unique in an ever-proliferating cinema-scape of super-hero movies."
Couldn't one or two or three dragons take care of the Army of the Dead in like a couple hours?,"That's essentially why Jon is there. When Jon received Tyrion's letter inviting him to Dragonstone, Davos Seaworth pointed out to Jon that fire kills the Others and asked him what breathes fire? From Season 7 Episode 2: Sansa: You think it's really Tyrion? It could be someone trying to
  lure you into a trap. Jon: Read the last bit. ""All dwarves are bastards in their father's
  eyes.""  Sansa: What does that mean?  Jon: It's something he said to me the first night we met. You know him
  better than any of us. What do you think?  Sansa: Tyrion's not like the other Lannisters. He was always kind to
  me, but it's too great a risk. Jon: ""The Seven Kingdoms will bleed as long as Cersei sits on the Iron
  Throne. Join us. Together, we can end her tyranny.""  Davos: Sounds like a charmer. Of course, the casual mention of a
  Dothraki horde, a legion of Unsullied, and three dragons a bit less
  charming. Jon: What?  Davos: Fire kills wights, you told me. What breathes fire?  Sansa: You're not suggesting Jon meet with her? So that's why Jon is there. He wants Daenerys to aid him in his fight with her dragons. He went against his Lords and Sansa's counsel and went to Dragonstone so that he could persuade Daenerys to send dragons for the Battle for Dawn Part II. He can't borrow them as such, as he can't control them (As of Episode 5 Season 6, since this looks like I am implying he won't ever be able to control them). But he can ask the person who can control them (Or one of them at any rate) to come with him."
Why all the fancy technology in most movies?,"Well, I think there is perfect reason for it: audience appeal. Of course those things are totally unrealistic and over the top, but show a simple black-and-white console to the audience or a basic database application and they will just find it boring to look at or think there is not much to it. Of course it bothers the hell out of those who know better, but the average guy that uses his computer for YouTube, Facebook and maybe Office is just more pleased with colorful displays and stunning graphics in a simple database query and is more likely to accept that there is something interesting going on. It's about conveying the information inherent in those abstract and hard to grasp processes in an interesting and entertaining way, thus sacrificing some realism for the sake of story-telling. (And of course all hackers fluently communicate in 0s and 1s, which makes them so awesome. ;-))"
Why does Zootopia have an intentional Breaking Bad reference?,"The directors addressed this scene and their motivation directly, indicating that it was both a cultural homage and just a really good joke: The gag works. During copious test screenings, Moore and Howard say they can consistently count on hearing adults crack up at the reference, coursing through the audience like a ripple the kids never notice.  The duo continues, “We kept thinking, well, at some point we’ve got to
  pull this back, but as we kept building the scene and designing it, we
  kept saying, well, there’s nothing really offensive about this. It’s a
  ram growing flowers in an abandoned train car, making a chemical
  serum. It evokes a show from pop culture, but it’s not like it’s
  something that’s offensive to the audience. But it really puts you
  into that mindset.” They have much more to say about this scene in the Entertainment Weekly article that the above quote comes from."
"In Back to the Future Part II, how could old Biff have made it back to 2015?","Speculation: Old Biff returns to the changed 2015 (designated 2015A). Doc and Marty ""transitioned"" to 2015A without noticing. Why didn't they notice? Maybe because they were out on the street when it happened and Hilldale looks the same in 2015A. BTW, time travelers ""transitioning"" between changed timelines is implied by Doc Brow when he tells Marty not to worry about leaving Jennifer on the porch in ""alternate 1985"". After they restored the timeline Jennifer was still sleeping on the porch.* Also, from Futurpedia: In scenes deleted from the film, Biff Tannen of 2015 fades out of existence (much like Marty was in the original movie when interfering with his parents' meeting) once arriving in the future, having been erased from existence in that time period. This can be explained for two different reasons: First, these events created a time paradox. Having created an alternate timeline by giving his younger self the almanac, the old Biff from 2015 no longer existed, once 2015A became part of the 1985A timeline. Another possibility is that Lorraine, in 1996 of the alternate timeline, shot and killed Biff. These events are never depicted in the trilogy, although Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale suggest this theory as a way of explaining Biff's ""disappearance."" I took some screenshots from a YouTube clip:    "
Why did the Joker take the risk of placing a gun in Harvey Dent's hand?,"The Joker really didn't care about death at any point even if Harvey pulled that trigger then. The biggest example for that is during the scene when he falls of the building during the fight with Batman even when he is falling, he laughs hysterically before Batman catches him with grapple gun. Harvey Dent was Joker's biggest ace. When he gave him the gun he took the gamble, had Harvey blown Joker's brain then the Joker wouldn't have cared about his death but he surely would've had the last laugh because he took the symbol (white knight) of the city and drove him to insanity and made him a killer. The Joker's primary ambition was to make Batman do that but Batman was completely incorruptible so he resorted to the next best person in Gotham city which happened to be Harvey Dent. Even Joker openly admits that in the above mentioned scene to batman. Batman: This city just showed you that it's full of people ready to believe in good. Joker:  Until their spirit breaks completely. Until they get a good look at the real Harvey Dent, huh? And all the heroic things he's done. You didn't think I'd risk losing the battle for Gotham's soul in a fist-fight with you? No, you need an ace in the hole; mine's Harvey. Batman: What did you do? Joker: I took Gotham's White Knight and brought him down to our level. It wasn't hard. See, madness, as you know, is like gravity: all it takes is a little push. (Laughter) Edit: I have been thinking about this question furthermore. I believe the only reason Joker walked out of the room alive in the hospital scene with Harvey Dent was because the coin toss favored him. As we learn later in further scenes Harvey only shot the people whom the coin toss didn't favor which included Batman as well."
How is this practical and very old scene shot?,"I thought this was going to be a long and difficult investigation... However, the answer was right there on IMDB, in the Trivia section The transformation scene was done in much the same way the beginning
  part of the transformation was done on Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931).
  The actress was made up in exaggerated highlights and shadows
  (including her teeth) using a single color shade of makeup. When
  filmed through a filter the same shade as the makeup, it's invisible
  to the camera. Take the filter away and the makeup suddenly becomes
  visible. Besides a filter, the makeup can also be hidden by
  similar-colored light. This type of trick was only possible on
  black-and-white film. Very clever indeed.   The seemingly 'slow' transformation is then probably achieved using a graduated filter [filter at one end, clear at the other], larger than the lens, which can be pulled relatively slowly in front, to achieve the apparent change."
"Does the T-1000 know that the ""big guy on a bike"" is a T-800 before he meets him?","The script confirms that, at the very least, the T-1000 (in the script as ""Officer X"") has a very good idea as to who the previous visitor was... It seems implicit from this that the T-1000 was fully aware of the previous Terminator.

How far back do I need to watch Doctor Who for it to still make sense?,"There are some great answers here already, but as a huge Whovian I wanted to add a little more information. As a complete beginner to the series definitely start with the 2005 Doctor Who series. The series will make perfect sense and there will be nothing revealed that will leave you confused (or at least nothing that won't be cleared up later in the series!).  There are old enemies/allies from the original series that will appear and you'll not realise it - but that won't affect your viewing experience in the least. Now, if you watch the Series, like it and decide to consider watching the Original Series, consider the following: Doctor Who kicked off all the way back in 1963. This is significant for a few reasons. The original series was in black and white. Now, I'm a child of the nineties and as much as I'm ashamed to admit it, a lack of colour really does affect a movie for me. I'm so unused to things being black and white that I find it much deeper to embrace older movies/shows. Of course that's not universal and I've enjoyed some fantastic old films and tv shows - but without question they require far more concentration on my part to really get into. If you're anything like me and you think that a lack of colour (at least for the first few series) would bother you, it's worth bearing this point in mind. Unlike the original Star Trek, which was in colour and has since been touched up/remastered, the original Doctor Who episodes with William Hartnell do show their age. They're certainly watchable and enjoyable, but you'll need to concentrate and accept some very dark/grainy footage at times. You'll also need to accept that as times changed, so did the character of the Doctor. Nowadays, we want a fun, energetic, brilliant, slightly sexy Doctor, which is where the likes of David Tennant (10th) and Matt Smith (11th) came from. Back then, the idea of the Doctor was that he would be a very intelligent, slightly dotty man. That's the character William Hartnell plays. An old, clever man, who is slightly mischievous. He by no means always saves the day. In fact, in many situations he's the one who gets them into trouble and his companions (Barbara and Ian, two teachers) are the saviours.  I'm bringing all this up because if you watch the new series, the character that the Doctor portrays is not how it was in the original series (at least to begin with). Another issue to consider is that in the very beginning Doctor Who had an educational remit. This meant that for every ""futuristic"" serial it ran, it had to run a serious ""historical"" serial which would accurately tell a real life historical event (such as Marco Polo, the burning of Rome by Nero etc). Now this remit only last a few series, but it's another thing that's worth bearing in mind. Finally, if you do decide to go back to the Original Series, there is one more thing you must accept. Due to the wiping policy of the BBC there are a number of episodes of Doctor Who that are missing (mostly Patrick Troughton, the 2nd Doctor's, but also a fair few of Hartnell's (1st Doctor)).  In other words, if you do start watching William Hartnell right from 1963, within a few years you'll start hitting episodes that you'll either have to listen to the audio from (they were broadcast over radio) or you'll have to skip entirely. Having said all that, the big positive of going back to the Original Series is that you'll get to soak in all the Doctor Who mythology, hear, see, live and breath the universe presented and be a ""true"" Whovian! But - it is a long (and expensive) haul. Don't expect to finish anytime soon! Conclusion  Unquestionably start with the Modern Series (2005). If you like it and want more and are considering the Original Series, consider the following questions: If the answer to any of these is yes, then perhaps the Original Series isn't for you. If the answer to all of these is no, then start watching and enjoying :)"
What were all the references in Deadpool?,"This answer is a Community Wiki, so if you want to add anything to it, just edit it. Den of Geek had an incredible article on this. I've used a lot of information from their site. All references below are from Den of Geek, unless stated otherwise. Deadpool creators: “Rob L.” written on one Goon’s coffee cup - a reference to one of Deadpool’s creators, Rob Liefeld. He and Fabian Nicieza worked on the comics. He actually cameos in the film, at the Hellhouse. Surprisingly, there isn't a single reference to his inability to draw feet. During the freeway battle, there are exits named Liefeld Rd, Nicieza St, and Miller Street (Tim Miller the Director). Ryan Reynolds: The cover of People Magazine’s November 17, 2010 issue (where Ryan Reynolds was named “Sexiest Man Alive.”) The inside of one goon's wallet is seen in the opening credits, containing a picture of the goon dressed as a superhero with a bright green mask and ring, referring to Reynolds playing Hal Jordan in DC Comics' Green Lantern film. Wade remarks that he doesn’t want his superhero suit to be green or animated. Both a reference to Ryan Reynolds’ Green Lantern stint and the fact that the Green Lantern costume was entirely animated. Wade happens to own an action figure of Deadpool from X-Men Origins: Wolverine for the sake of jabbing at that movie’s terrible portrayal. As a joke, he wants to show Vanessa the greatest thing in the world, and picks up the toy... and the vinyl music record it's sitting on top of. He shows her the record. Ajax suggests sewing Wade's mouth shut. While working in the context of the scene, Wade tells him that it's a bad idea, a reference to the unpopular depiction of Wade Wilson in X-Men Origins: Wolverine. When freaking out after Vanessa's kidnapping, Wade mutters a line beginning with ""Cock juggling [inaudible]..."" which could be a reference to a similar line used by the character played by Ryan Reynolds in Blade: Trinity. On the Deadpool board in Sister Margaret's someone bet on R Reynold to die. While recovering after the freeway fight, Wade is being consoled by his blind friend, who urges him again to go after Vanessa. Wade demurs, citing his looks, and adds, ""Do you think Ryan Reynolds got this far on his superior acting ability?"" Comic traits: Deadpool's initial costume is white. This might be a nod to his X-Force attire, or his X-Force team member, Fantomex (who's pretty similar to Deadpool in character). Deadpool breaks the fourth wall, talking directly to the viewer at times and being well aware that he’s fictional. This aspect of the character has been around since the late-90s. Deadpool remarks that he looks like he was bitten by a radioactive shar-pei. Not only is this an easy Spider-Man reference, but it’s also a reference to Cable/Deadpool #2 from way back in 2004 where Deadpool compared himself to Ryan Reynolds mixed with a shar-pei, which is the frame that got Ryan interested in playing Deadpool in the first place. It came full circle. “Ya, I love the character. I’ve always loved the character. I remember reading one of the Deadpool comic books, and somebody asked Deadpool what he looks like. And he said he looks like a cross between a Shar-Pei and Ryan Reynolds. And I was like, I really, really wanna play this guy at some point. I thought it was pretty cool. It’s a guy that knows he’s in a comic book. How hard is it to shoot that properly? That’s not something they put in Wolverine nor would it belong in that universe.” When beating up Ajax, Deadpool refers to himself as being from Regina, Saskatchewan. Deadpool's nationality is something that bounces back and forth in the comics depending on the writer. Some say he's American while others say Canadian. The latest run with him has basically solidified the idea that he's Canadian. Weasel suggests Wade should star in a horror movie and likens him to Freddy Krueger. It's a comparison that's been made several times in the comics, most recently by Kate Bishop Hawkeye, who thought it was a Halloween costume and was instead mortified to realize it was actually Deadpool. With a knife in his skull, Deadpool sees little cartoon characters crowding around Vanessa. Ever since Daniel Way took over writing Deadpool (starting with Wolverine Origins #21), he started a regular gag where Deadpool would see the world differently like that. It's been referred to as Pool-o-Vision. Wade gets ready for the final battle with the line, ""Time to make the chimi-fuckin'-changas."" During Vol 1, and Cable/Deadpool, he randomly says chimichangas and some of the fandom latched on. In Cable/Deadpool #13, Deadpool is in a restaurant that makes the best chimichangas on the island. Then he specifically says ""Don't even like chimichangas all that much. I just love saying it."". He immediately orders an Enchilada instead. That line has been ignored, and somehow the fandom stuck to the idea that he loves chimichangas. This is also a reference to the famous ""Time to make the donuts"" commercial for Dunkin Donuts from the 1980's. Wade’s incident with the pizza guy is heavily based on a scene from Daniel Way’s run with the character. It’s from Deadpool v.2 #10. Despite the movie’s R-rating, the comic version is a lot darker. It isn’t just a case of stalking countered by intimidation, nor is it about teenagers. The pizza boy ruined Deadpool’s client’s high school life, which carried over into her adult life, due to spreading some horrible rumors about her. The playful, sexual way Wade messes with the pizza boy ties into Deadpool’s pansexual nature, which director Tim Miller insisted they play up. There are loads (heh) of other references to Wade's fluid sexuality in the movie, too. Arguably, many people believe, based on different interpretations of the character's history, that it's just a way Wade talks and acts to mess with people's heads while working/fighting. During one scene, Wade is wearing a shirt with Bea Arthur on it. In a running gag that started in Cable/Deadpool #1, Deadpool considered Bea Arthur to be the sexiest woman in show business. The pizza is from Feige's Famous Pizza. Kevin Feige is the president of Marvel Studios. (Thanks, Jim the Nickel and bittergourd!) Vanessa Carlysle: Vanessa Carlysle, otherwise known as Copycat, is Deadpool’s original flame in the comics. Technically, she appeared first in New Mutants #98 along with Deadpool, in the sense that in the comics she’s a shape-shifter and was really pretending to be other new character Domino. They didn't reveal that fact until several issues later. Prior to that life, much like in the movie, she was a prostitute. After Vanessa makes a reference to Empire Strikes Back involving Yoda, Wade remarks that it's like he made her in a computer. Likely an allusion to the movie (and later TV show) 'Weird Science' about a couple nerds who made the perfect woman using their computer. The idea of Wade wanting to leave Vanessa behind out of fear of her seeing him die of cancer is lifted straight from the comics. It was briefly shown in the first Deadpool miniseries, Deadpool: The Circle Chase (1993), and was revisited in Deadpool v.1 #-1. Wade jokes about ""boomboxing"" the WHAM! song ""Careless Whisper,"" which is a nod to 'Say Anything'..., the 1989 movie where John Cusack holds his stereo over his head, playing ""In Your Eyes"" by Peter Gabriel in order to serenade his girlfriend. As reader Francisco Lourenço Ribeiro points out, the scene of Vanessa going into the rainy alley to get kidnapped by Ajax may be based on the scene in Spider-Man where Mary Jane is saved from muggers and Peter hides in the shadows. This is supported by Weasel telling Deadpool, ""Go get her, tiger,"" what with ""tiger"" being Mary Jane's trademark thing. Weasel: Weasel has been Deadpool’s go-to weapons and tech guy since the first Deadpool miniseries, The Circle Chase. He was created by Fabian Nicieza and Joe Madureira. Real name Jack Hammer (yes, really), Weasel is actually improved by the movie’s take. Mainly because in the comics, Weasel is the one constantly taking abuse from Wade, which just makes Wade look like a bully. (Side note, Wade was a bully, an actual villain, at the start. His relationship with Weasel improves greatly as Deadpool becomes an anti-hero and then on his current heroic attempts). Sister Margaret’s School for Wayward Children, otherwise known as the Hellhouse, is another Joe Kelly creation, appearing in Deadpool v.1 #1. Run by an old man named Patch, the Chicago-based clubhouse was a place for mercenaries to hang out and get job offers. This was mainly used as an excuse to have Deadpool constantly butt heads with his main (at the time) arch-nemesis T-Ray. Liefeld is one of the names on the Dead Pool (see? Told ya there were more references to Deadpool's creators). Wade even acknowledges one of the mercs by that name. When Wade orders the blowjob drink at the bar, the waitress' name is Kelly. Joe Kelly wrote Deadpool in the late-90s and is credited as being the writer who truly gave him life as a three-dimensional character. The Dead Pool board has a lot of Easter egg names mixed in there. Hell if I have the full list, but I did see ""M. Tyson"" and ""S. LaBeouf"" mixed in there. Give it some time. I'm sure someone will have a screenshot. A few other names noticed are C. Sheen, K West, W Wilson, V Putin, R Reynolds, TJ Miller,B Cosby, O Osbourne, J Nelson, L Lohan, and M Cyrus. The Dead Pool is a thing from the comics, but not at the Hellhouse. It was originally at the Hospice, where rejects and failures from the Weapon X program were sent to die (peacefully, but it turns out worse). Ajax: The villain of the story is Ajax, otherwise known as Francis. He first appeared in Deadpool v.1 #14, created by Joe Kelly and Walter McDaniel. Originally known as the Attending (Ajax was his cyborg upgrade), he was a Weapon X experiment with super-strength, speed, etc. and also couldn’t feel pain. Since he was a complete sociopath, the government decided he wasn’t worth using as a superhero. Instead, he became an orderly at the Hospice, the Weapon X den where Wade was eventually (illegally) experimented on. The dialogue about last words when Deadpool is about to kill Ajax is extremely similar to the conversation Nick Fury and Baron Von Strucker had in Secret Warriors before Fury shot Von Strucker in the head. Probably just a coincidence. Colossus: Colossus, real name Piotr Rasputin, is the oldest Marvel character in this movie, debuting in Giant-Size X-Men #1 in 1975. He was created by Len Wein and Dave Cockrum. Despite his big inclusion in this movie, he has very little history with Deadpool in the comics. They fought briefly during the Daniel Way run of Deadpool and in a time-travel story, the two were in a future incarnation of the X-Men. He's just as much a boy scout in the comics as he is in the movie. The movie really plays up the Papa Bear aspect. Deadpool compares Professor Xavier to Heaven's Gate, a religious cult that existed for a few decades and made news in 1997 when its members killed themselves, believing that their souls would be picked up by UFOs and brought to Heaven. Deadpool destroying his own limbs in an attempt to fight Colossus and failing every step of the way is a bit of a reference to the Black Knight from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. In the original leaked script, Deadpool even calls it out more blatantly. He even references Colossus as RoboCop (""Dead or alive, you're coming with me!""), which goes well with the agonizing, Verhoeven-esque, over-the-top violence of the scene. Colossus talks about bringing Deadpool to the Professor, and he asks if it's going to be James McAvoy or Patrick Stewart, as the new timeline thing is really confusing. Obviously he's breaking the fourth wall and talking about the events of X-Men: Days of Future Past and how it affects the X-Men movies' continuity. Deadpool warns about spoilers for 127 Hours, which ended with James Franco cutting off his own limb to escape. When Deadpool's blood splatters all over Colossus' face, he jokes, ""Are you there, God? It's me, Margaret."" A reference to the book of the same name by Judy Bloom, which is about a girl having her first period. The way Deadpool falls off the bridge and lands in a garbage truck as it drives off is very much like what happens to John Cusack in the movie Better Off Dead, though his fall was far more accidental. (Thanks to Oeno) Negasonic Teenage Warhead: Negasonic Teenage Warhead, named after the awesome song by Monster Magnet, was a short-lived character introduced by Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely in New X-Men #115 back in 2001. Deadpool calls her Ripley from Alien 3, mainly due to having the same short hair and stern outlook. He also refers to her as Sinead O'Connor, a musician known for her shaved head, and quotes her song ""Nothing Compares 2 U."" Negasonic's outfit is closer to the classic outfits of the original X-Men. It also plays well into the joke from the first X-Men movie where they mention the lack of yellow spandex. It was mostly a jab at Wolverine's comic self, but Cyclops is living in a glass house on that one. (Thanks to Jack9Crow) Negasonic comments on how often the X-Mansion is destroyed. [thanks to @nickson104] Angel Dust: Angel Dust is another random character, though at least the power set is correct. She was created by Geoff Johns and Shawn Martinbrough in Morlocks #1 in 2002. Coincidentally, this would be the second time a villain of a Ryan Reynolds movie is a Johns creation. Green Lantern featured the entity Parallax. Angel Dust has a thing about chomping on matchsticks and Deadpool asks if she's a big Stallone fan. In the Sylvester Stallone movie Cobra, he spends the entire movie chomping on a matchstick. Blind Al: Blind Al is another Joe Kelly creation, appearing first in Deadpool v.1 #1. A motherly figure, she’s actually Deadpool’s prisoner in the comics. It’s played for laughs for a while until later going into how messed up their relationship actually is. Deadpool occasionally put her in The Box, a literal torture chamber for various imagined transgressions, before his heroic turn. While written out at the end of Kelly’s run, she has shown up here and there over the years to give advice. Deadpool refers to her as Mrs. Magoo. Mr. Magoo is a cartoon character created in the 1949, known for getting into comedic situations due to his blindness. He also calls her Ronnie Milsap at one point. Milsap is a blind country singer. In the scene when Blind Al is being introduced, ""Hit the Road, Jack"" by Ray Charles is played in the background (Ray Charles is blind). [thanks to @Dunno] David Cunningham (Worm): Bob: Deadpool runs into an enemy named Bob that he appears to be old friends with. Ever since debuting in Cable/Deadpool #38, Bob, Agent of Hydra has been Wade's ever-suffering sidekick. Come to think of it, Wade has a lot of ever-suffering sidekicks. Since Hydra is a Marvel property tied to Captain America/Avengers that Fox has no access to, he is made a generic goon of Francis. I doubt Francis offers full dental either. Deadpool mentions that Bob's wife's name is Gail. While Bob is married to a woman named Allison in the comics, Gail is almost definitely a reference to Gail Simone, considered to be one of the best Deadpool writers despite writing a relatively few issues. Deadpool Post-Credits The post-credits sequence is a take on Ferris Bueller’s Day Off, down to the setting and bathrobe and the demand that the viewers go home. Oh, and the ""chicka chick-aaaah!"" He jokes about Sam Jackson showing up with an Eye Patch, a reference to the revolutionary post-credits scene from 'Iron Man'. Which Samuel L Jackson was paid handsomely for. Deadpool confirms Cable will be in Deadpool 2. The son of Cyclops and Madelyne Pr...forget it. Explaining who he is would take too long. He's from the future, he's Deadpool's original nemesis in New Mutants #98 where Deadpool was introduced, and they eventually starred in their own buddy comic for 50 issues as well as a recent digital series. They're the odd couple of the mutant corner of Marvel. Other Deadpool owns an Adventure Time watch. The joke is basically the reference, I guess. You're on the internet. You already know what Adventure Time is. You have to. The joke also being that a fully grown man like Wade watches a children's cartoon. Wade also likes Voltron, Hello Kitty, and other childish franchises. When joking about fondling Wolverine's balls, he starts speaking in an Australian accent and mentions ""down under,"" a more direct reference to Hugh Jackman's nationality. One of the prominent signs on the freeway says ""Parker Boulevard."" As reader Mike Priest points out, this could very well be a reference to Spider-Man. My first reaction was that it might be a reference to comic writer Jeff Parker, but that guy's written like a single Deadpool comic in his career, so that's not too likely. Deadpool constantly refers to the recruiter character as Agent Smith, likening him to the cold, suit-wearing villain from the Matrix movies. Later in the movie, Deadpool attacks the recruiter while calling him Jared and makes a joke about a footlong. This would be innocent on its own, but considering Wade made jokes earlier about the recruiter seeming like a child molester, this is most definitely a topical joke about Jared Fogle's recent arrest and conviction for being a pedo. Joking about Batman and Robin’s sexuality is old hat, but most famous for Fredric Wertham’s attempts to bring down the comics industry with his book Seduction of the Innocent. When Ajax and Angel Dust leave Sister Margaret’s, Weasel makes fun of them for dressing like they’re going to go watch Blade 2. Blade Trinity starred Ryan Reynolds as Hannibal King, another Marvel [Deadpan Snarker] 12 character which inspired many to think he’d play the perfect Deadpool. Frankly most of Reynold's characters are Deadpan Snarkers. The way Deadpool impales the final goon with two katanas and holds him up is very reminiscent of the Adam Kubert cover of Wolverine #88, the first ever meeting between Wolverine and Deadpool. Stan Lee has his expected Marvel cameo, this time as a strip club DJ. What’s funny and notable about this is that Stan Lee didn’t co-create a single character in this movie. Explicitly called out as a Glorified Cameo during the title sequence, similarly to many other roles in a tongue-in-cheek manner. Stan Lee did create 'Stripperella', a mature (non-porn) adult cartoon super-heroine, who is a Stripper, making the cameo less random than it seemed. Voltron: Defender of the Universe was a cartoon from Japan in the mid-1980s where five pilots would control giant lion mechs, then combine them into a sword-swinging robot. Wade talks about his Liam Neeson nightmare, where he goes into a tangent about the Taken trilogy without outright identifying the movies by name. The choice of Liam Neeson as the butt of the joke might be due to Neeson's role in Darkman, another movie about a super-antihero with disfigured face. (Darkman was directed by Sam Raimi, who also directed the 2002–2007 Spider-Man trilogy.) During the bit where Deadpool's freaking out over hitting a woman, he throws off an attacker while yelling, ""Get off me, spider monkey!"" As pointed out by reader Jason Aniceto, this is taken from the first Twilight, where Edward tells Bella, ""You'd better hang on tight, spider monkey,"" while she was on his back in similar fashion. It's more likely a reference to Deadpool Vol 2 #19-21, 'WHATEVER A SPIDER CAN'. Deadpool and Spiderman team up to stop Hit Monkey. Yes, Marvel has a character that's a non-talking monkey that's a hitman. You don't believe me. When going after Ajax, Deadpool brings with him a copy of the November 25, 2008 People Magazine where Hugh Jackman was awarded ""Sexiest Man."" One of the experiments in the facility where Wade gets his powers has bones sticking out of their back. This is likely a reference to X-Men character Marrow, who constantly has them jabbing out of her back and can regenerate them at will. Marrow is also in the video game series Marvel vs. Capcom, where Deadpool was added as a fighting character in MvC 3. Alternatively, it can be a reference to Spyke, a mutant that was introduced in the cartoon X-Men Evolution, and is Storm's nephew. He also has bone spikes like Marrow. The final battle between Deadpool and Ajax takes place on a dismantled SHIELD helicarrier. The original concept art makes this pretty blatantly obvious, but the artist was asked to downplay the resemblance (presumably for legal reasons). Before the end credits, he calls himself ""your friendly neighborhood pool guy"", yet another jab at how similar he is to Spider-Man (whose trademark catchphrase refers to himself as ""your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man""). They are constantly confused for each other in-universe in the comics. Deadpool calls out the lack of inhabitants at the X-Mansion other than Negasonic Teenage Warhead and Colossus, questioning whether the studio could not afford any other X-Men. [thanks to @nickson104] During the animated end credits, Deadpool dangles in the upper right corner of the frame while upside down and apparently from a web string, much like Spider-Man is seen to do. When Negasonic Teenage Warhead is finishing her Tweet before attacking Angel Dust, the fuselage of a wrecked aircraft is in the background. The registration is C-FLNT, a likely nod to Captain Flint of the Howling Commandos. One scene has a closeup of Wade's headboard covered in stickers. Some of them resemble the TOPPS 90's X-Men stickers, one of which looked like Apocalypse, the villain for the upcoming X-Men movie. During the final battle he has stapled a photo of Hugh Jackman on his face, just in case he loses his mask. There are also at least 3 Monty Pythonesque references. The competition between Wade and Vanessa over who had the shittiest upbringing is a nod to the ""Four Yorkshiremen"" skit, the ""Fight"" between Deadpool and Collosus is overtly similar to the Black knight scene in ""Monty Python and Holy Grail"", and when trying to guess Ajax's name, Wades last guess is Basil Fawlty (from Fawlty Towers) which while not from Monty Python, stars John Cleese, arguably Monty Python's most famous member. When demanding that Ajax fix the damage done to him, Deadpool refers to his disfigurement as a ""butter face"". This refers to an old sexist joke: One guy turns to another and says, ""Look at that hottie!"".
The other replies, ""She's a butterface.""
""What?""

Was the dragon prowess intentionally downplayed in S08E04?,"It's a major plot hole is what it is. People can come up with all the excuses they want, what happened is S08E05 can in no logical way make sense after what happened in S08E04. The scenes where Drogon sweeps over chains of scorpions without any of them being aimed at him or fired in time even though he takes ages to do those sweeps and that he seems closer than during the ambush by the iron fleet is complete nonsense. It seems there are far more scorpions this time around, that the dragon moves in a somewhat predictable manner yet none of them manage to get a shot. It also seems like this time they insisted on showing that it takes a long time to reload the weapons whereas in the previous one it felt like they had machine guns on those ships. Just the same way that the scenes at the end of episode 4 where Drogon just hangs out in the back well within range of the scorpions without Cersei taking a shot at him make no sense whatsoever."
How do they get very young child actors to cooperate?,"It's part timing, part cajoling and part luck. I don't know the specific laws for other countries, but in the UK, children under 5 can only be ""at work"" for a maximum of 5 hours a day, between 9.30 and 4.30. This is from the moment they arrive into costume or hair/makeup at base, not when they get to set.
One child takes at minimum two, if not three or four, supervising adults - a chaperone (a professional who does this for a living), and one or two parents, who usually have not a clue what's going on. A lot of the day is spent keeping the parents fed, watered and amused as they look after the child, meaning a runner will often be assigned to them too, to fetch and carry. This small entourage will move as a single unit for the whole day. The child is only allowed to be on set for 30 minutes at a time, with a total maximum of 2 hours on set per day. Additional breaks can be taken at the request of the chaperone or parent. So, you bring the child in at the very last possible moment, onto a set with perhaps 100 other people - total strangers to the child. Also bear in mind that the set might be an ordinary living room... which only has three walls and a whole gantry of lights above an open ceiling... built from plywood in a massive open space which is mostly otherwise in darkness; vaguely revealing other strange wooden boxes off in the distance. Not exactly an ordinary situation to be thrust into.
If there was time, they have been introduced and had a little 'getting-to-know-you' time with the principal actor they need to interact with. You then have 30 minutes to get them to do the one thing they are needed for, in sync with any other relevant action and dialog the adults need to perform.
You cannot overrun. Someone will be timing this to the absolute second, from the time they entered the studio. This is serious.
It can take something like a minute or more to get from everyone ready to go to actually calling ""Action"". All the precursor of calling the roll, hearing everyone's 'rolling/speed' responses from camera and sound, slating each camera, getting the camera op's opening shot 'set' and then all you need is the kid to behave for just 3 seconds… on cue. Anyone who thinks a child under 3 will concentrate for the 3 seconds they appear in close-up hasn't actually tried to do this when there are 100 cast and crew around them, with some poor, overworked chaperone and the kid's mum, waving teddies and forced-cheerfully shouting ""Over here, cherub! Look at the bunny!"" in an increasingly frustrated manner... whilst the crew just keeps on rolling, in the hope they'll get one eventually. A couple of pics of random sets - just to give an idea of how daunting it may be for a small child thrown into this situation. Movie sets do not meet anyone's definition of 'normal'. An adult will rapidly acclimatise, a child less-so.
There's too many people, too much dark; you can't see out past the lights, too much weird, too much distraction.

How did Sherlock survive the fall?,"He jumped into the truck which was in front of the pavement and drove off as soon as he pushed a body out wearing his clothes or he landed in the truck and then rolled from the truck to the pavement. Remember how he told Watson exactly where to stand?
(to make sure he could only see from the correct angle) Watson was delayed by a bicycle hitting him as he ran over.
(to give Holmes and co some extra time) Watson was pushed back by bystanders telling him not to look?
(so he would not spot any inconsistencies but would see enough) Suddenly medics appeared and rushed off with the body?
(to prevent Watson, or anyone else, looking too closely) Holmes remarking to Molly that he needed her?
(either for a spare corpse or to falsely pronounce him dead) This fits well with the books where Holmes often keeps Watson in the dark, especially as Watson is a very poor liar."
What do actors actually inhale when their characters snort cocaine or smoke crack?,"Because of powdered milk's resemblance to cocaine and other drugs, powdered milk is sometimes used in film-making as a non-toxic prop that may be inhaled. Other methods listed on nypost.com are - “It’s usually cornstarch, but you have to put a bit of baby powder
into it, because starch is too sticky and heavy,” says Gillian
Albinski, the property master on Homeland. “I always use powdered lactose,” says longtime prop master Mychael
Bates, who worked on 2011’s Horrible Bosses. Colin Farrell didn’t seem to mind. He was even snorting the powder
off-camera in order to stay in character, Bates says. For the lactose-intolerant, something like a vitamin B powder (inositol),
available at health-food stores, might be substituted. Snorting any powder over multiple takes can cause an actor to become
congested. (Or just angry.) In that case, the prop masters will
sometimes coat the inside of the coke straw with Vaseline. When the
powder is snorted, most of it sticks to the straw instead of going up
the actor’s nose. For pot/crack: Besides heroin, “Homeland” includes scenes of Morgan Saylor’s character Dana Brody smoking pot. “I’ve worked on shows where actors have wanted to smoke the real thing, and I was constantly fighting to take away their real bags,” Albinski says. “Oregano smells so much like the real thing, you have to check carefully to make sure they haven’t switched it out.” Other prop masters do use the real thing — sort of. Companies, including legalbuds.com, sell ganja without the active ingredient THC. It looks and burns like marijuana, but it won’t get anyone high. Crack rocks are created by dropping globs of Krazy Glue into a pile of baking soda."
Why do studios use Roman numerals in the copyright notice in the end credits?,"According to David Feldman's book Imponderables: The Solution to the Mysteries of Everyday Life: Why are copyrighted dates on movies and television shows written in Roman numerals?  The general consensus is the ""deception theory"":  Then there's the ""inertia theory"":  This BBC article says something similar: Perhaps one of the most notable areas where people are likely to come across Roman numerals is in TV and film credits, where the convention is not to spell out what year something was made. The practice is believed to have started in an attempt to disguise the age of films or television programmes. In other words, the opposite of claiming an undeserved antiquity."
Switch in *The Matrix* - Two Actors?,"It only took 5 years and 6 months for a source to surface. Lilly Wachowski (formerly known as Andy Wachowski) says, indeed, Switch was supposed to have different genders in the Matrix and Real World in recent NetFlix interview. She says, among other things: ... we had the character of Switch who was like a character, who'd be like a man in the Real World, and then a woman in the Matrix It's worth seeing the interview, as she talks about the corporate meddling, but yes, Switch was supposed to be a trans person with a different mental body image that'd represent him/herself as the opposite gender in the Matrix. As a side note, this question is so old, back then Lilly hadn't come out as transgender woman yet. But the likelihood of the idea grows exponentially when not just one, but both of the creators eventually came to reveal themselves as transgender."
Why does Thanos need *all* the infinity stones?,"I like Skibisky's thoughts, that perhaps each stone plays its own role. Here's what I think they may be doing if this were the case: Enact his will to fairly — Mind
manipulate energy — Power
everywhere across the universe — Space
wiping from existence — Reality
only sentient beings — Soul
immediately (and irreversibly?). — Time  I believe power has to be used to cause that disintegration, that's what I mean by ""manipulate energy"". Matter is a form of energy, organisms are made from matter — maybe the matter they are made of is being destroyed (thought impossible under conventional laws of physics). Or the energy binding them together is being manipulated. I don't actually think each stone fulfils a specific purpose like this though, I think it's simply that the change he wants to make is so large-scale that he needs to be able to manipulate the entire cosmos at once. Only all the stones brought together can do this. You suggest he use the time stone to ""freeze"" time as he journeys the universe killing people. I wonder if Thanos is worried he would get bored of this and lose his will to commit this genocide, or become mad in old-age (perhaps not physical but his mind would be ageing). Also, we have seen that the time stone seems to only work locally when used in isolation from the other stones. I think to alter the fabric of the universe, to make such massive changes on such a large scale, he truly needs all of the stones to work together, like they did when the universe was created."
Why is the 'You talking to me' speech from the movie 'Taxi Driver' so famous?,"Just to get the more superficial reason out of the way first, it's possible that those particular words got stuck in our heads and are now representative of this entire scene because they're repeated 4 times during his speech. Repetition simply drills certain things into our heads. But beyond that, I think this is mainly about emotional complexity and intimacy. Our protagonist is unravelling and this is portrayed through a monologue (or soliloquy) into a mirror where he unknowingly shares his emotions with us. This device harks all the way back to Hamlet, but here, it's imbued with realism through Bickle's psyche and demeanor that De Niro (who improvised the lines) conveys in a chillingly natural way. The scene is also oddly playful, putting us in Bickle's shoes (what we see is his reflection) as we play make-believe with him, maybe even triggering memories where we imagined standing up to someone, or practised speeches in front of a mirror - but contrasting it with his fractured mind and violent plans. This establishes a connection between us and him but also a repulsion, given the dangerous context; We also feel sorry for him: Not only does he seem delusional, but ""I'm the only one here"" also tells us just how lonely he is. In short, I think it's memorable because it's a simple, short and naturally delivered phrase that actually represents a scene and character with a surprising amount of complexity. It's relatable but also scary and deeply troubling, which is why it ended up encapsulating Bickle's state of mind for us."
How can I find tv shows/films similar to one I like?,"There are a couple of websites that can help find similar shows or movies: If you go to the TV show or movie's Wikipedia page, scroll to the bottom and you'll see a box with the Categories for that page.  Often this will contain links to various genres or classes of TV shows and movies.  Clicking on those links will take you to lists of all the works that have been put into those Categories, so they'll share that similarity with the work you enjoyed. TV Tropes is a site that documents and classifies works (it covers TV shows and films, but many other things as well, such as books, manga, fanfic, etc.) based on genres as well as 'tropes' which are more specific plot/writing devices.  So you have pages that list various works that have casually killed off characters.  Similar to Wikipedia, if you head to a specific TV show or movie page, you'll get a list of tropes that this TV show or movie used.  Those trope pages will then have links to other works that are in the same genres or use the same tropes. IMDb documents TV shows and films and the people who work on them.  So if you like a specific actor, or the writing, or the directing of a TV show or film, hit up IMDb. You can look up a specific actor/writer/director and see everything they've worked on. Wikipedia also has some of this information, but IMDb tends to be more comprehensive as this is their specific focus. IMDb also tags shows with keywords which can be used to locate movies with similar plot elements (example). Jinni.com is also used to search for movies and TV shows based on your taste."
Why does Quentin Tarantino add non-plot related dialogue in his movies?,"His characters are supposed to be real people. Real people have those types of conversations. It humanizes the characters, whilst, at the same time, setting up the disconnect between their words and their actions. Take that hamburger conversation.. They're on their way to work, not at work. So they catch up, talk about their lives and other minutae not related to work, just like ordinary folks. When they get to work... they switch modes. But even then, they were having a conversation about burgers which ties into the subsequent action when they recover that briefcase. Here's an excellent comment I found which explains it perfectly. In Pulp Fiction, almost every line is brilliant in a distinct way. From the poetic prose of some of the monologues, to the quick and profane exchanges between actors, this movie has it all, and it is all great. Tarantino writes with a knack for realistic dialogue. His characters talk about real things and often discuss day-to-day proceedings which seem irrelevant to the plot. This brings the characters to life, but what QT also often does is subtly slip that seemingly random dialogue back into the plot. For example, in Pulp Fiction Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent (John Travolta) have the best written conversation about hamburgers in the history of cinema. They compare quarter pounders in America to those in France while on the way to kill some young men who ripped off their boss. The French name for the burger reappears in the dialogue later when they’re “in character” in the apartment of the guys they’ve been sent to whack. The use of such ordinary conversation is almost hilarious at times, as Tarantino’s characters may be discussing the simplest things while carrying out a contrasting action- like stashing a body or dealing drugs.

Why did Victor die?,"I've always assumed it's because Gus knows that Victor was seen at the house (the house where Gale Boetticher was murdered by Jesse Pinkman) -- remember that Victor and Mike had a conversation about the fact that he'd been seen (Mike was upset at it, and Victor didn't think it was that big of a deal). Gus isn't one to leave any possibility that he could be discovered by Victor's carelessness, so he knows it has to be done. Of course, he does it in the way that he does as a power play, hoping that the shock of it will convince Walt and Jesse to fall in line (i.e. ""Hey guys, if I'm willing to kill my trusted assistant because he screwed up, do you really think I won't do it to you if it comes to that?"")"
Is it really as easy to knock someone out in real life as in the movies?,"Disclaimer: Violence is stupid and dangerous. A blow to the skull is often fatal.  I wouldn't say it's easy, but there are several sweet spots on the skull that, when hit with sufficient force, is almost guaranteed to cause unconsciousness. I would suggest the upper part of the jaw bone or the temple. Both places are connected to the brain stem through nerves and/or arteries. A punch here will cause the force to reach your brain and shut you down. I also believe that it's an important factor whether you expect the punch or it lands like a lightning from a blue sky. The latter are by far the worst. You'll almost certainly wake up surrounded by panicked individuals with a severely swollen head and no clue as to what happened ... then you throw up. Found this on Quora:  A bunch of studies of head injuries in primates were done at U Penn some years ago. Bottom line: it took 3 times less energy to knock an individual out with a ROTATIONAL blow (e.g. roundhouse punch) than with a TRANSLATIONAL strike (e.g. a jab). There are 2 main mechanisms: 1) Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can cushion a linear blow, but not a
  rotational one (the CSF and brain spin side by side in a rotational
  movement)  2) the upper brainstem and higher brain can twist on each other
  because of their size, shape and relative positions (and the arteries
  that supply them can also twist), kind of like an apple and its stem,
  causing loss of function precisely where ""consciousness"" resides in
  the brain (the reticular activating system) The studies mentioned by the Quora poster might be any of the many studies that came out of the Head Injury Laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania, but is most likely referring (primarily) to ""Physical model simulations of brain injury in the primate"", by Margulies SS, Thibault LE, and Gennarelli TA (published in the Journal of Biomechanics in 1990)."
Were oranges an intentional use of symbolism by filmmakers?,"No and Yes According to various sources [one here], Francis Ford Coppola confirms on the DVD commentaries “It started out as an accident”, said Coppola in DVD commentaries, “but once we realized we had used oranges so frequently in the first movie, we used them purposefully in the others.” The saga ends with Michael dying, an orange in his hand.  The original reason... Time.com In his book on the making of the film, The Godfather Legacy, Harlen Lebo writes, “For [production designer] Dean Tavoularis, oranges were simply another carefully chosen compliment to otherwise somberly dressed sets. ‘We knew this film wasn’t going to be about bright colors, and oranges make a nice contrast,’ said Tavoularis."
How could the human race be saved in Interstellar?,"You pose an interesting question. It may indeed seem that this is a paradox since the humans couldn't have gone back in time to save themselves when they wouldn't have been saved in the first place. But your problem is actually that you're searching a cause out of nothing where there is none. You are basically searching for the beginning of a circle. You assume that there could be an alternative timeline where humanity was not saved by the whole wormhole/tesseract stuff from its future self but then created the observed timeline by sending the message back. But such an alternative timeline does not exist and can't ever exist in the time concept of the movie, which follows the Novikov self-consistency principle in this regard. The point is that the timeline has always been this way and hasn't been created out of another timeline by some external influence, humanity has always been saved by its future self and will always safe its past self. If they hadn't saved themselves, they wouldn't exist to save themselves, as you realized yourself. You just have to stop looking for the beginning of what is a time loop, because there is no dedicated beginning, this time loop has always been part of the universe's unchangable time continuum.1 There is no point in reasoning about a reality where Cooper did not send the message to his daughter and himself in exactly the same way as he received them, since that is not the reality we're shown. It is not possible for Cooper to send other messages to himself than the ones he received or for the ""Bulk Beings"" to not open the wormhole in the future, since all that has basically already happened in Cooper's and earth's past. If he'd do it differently, he had received different messages in the first place. I know this may sound like a lame excuse or discussing away a supposed paradox just by its necessity. But it is really a fundemantally different approach of looking at time travel in contrast to, say, a different timeline whenever the past is changed. By saying that the past cannot ever in any slight way be changed -- and that's indubitably what the movie says -- the existence of any kind of paradoxa is basically avoided. One just has to accept the fact that the future 5D superhumans will at some point create that wormhole for us and will at some point create the tesseract for Cooper. Why they do this exactly is admittedly not answered by the movie, which just doesn't care about their reasons as they seem irrelevant here, but they certainly do it in exactly the same way as it already happened, because it happened in the way they did it. This interpretation of an unchangable timeline is in fact a common way to avoid the problem of time paradoxa. A good other example for this is the movie Twelve Monkeys, where the end reveals  that the timeline has always looked this way and the young Cole has always seen his older self die. And in fact when viewing that movie for the first time, it immediately struck me as one of the most plausible time travel movies ever, since it avoids any kind of paradox present in many other time travel movies by the simple consequence that the exact flow of events cannot ever be changed at all and every kind of time travel is already part of the causality chain that led up to it, even if in a circular way. (I have to add though, that discussions on this site have since made me doubt the unchangability of timelines in Twelve Monkeys a bit. But nevermind, Interstellar with its perfectly consistent depiction of a completely unchangable timeline can now take its place.) 1 If you want a more metaphysical term for this, call it fate, but don't take that too seriously, I'm still talking about an entirely physical interpretation here and nobody wants to steal your free will ;-)."
What kind of company is Initech?,"Initech is ostensibly a software company, but I don't think it could really exist.  I'll take your points one at a time. Initech hires computer programmers that ""update bank software for the 2000 switch"" This would fit either a bank/credit union, or a software consulting company. Initech has access to ""the credit union software"" Again, this would fit both.  Programmers at a consulting company absolutely need access to the source code in order to make changes. Initech has access to ""the credit union mainframe"" Access to the mainframe pretty much eliminates ""consulting company.""  I happen to work as a programmer at a bank through a consulting company.  There's no way any bank or credit union is going to give access to a consultant to run unchecked code on any system where it could cause harm. Initech's accounting department notices when the money goes missing This also eliminates ""software consulting company"" from consideration.  A consulting company has their own accounting department that would track expenses and income for their own activities, not those of their customers.  The bank or credit union would notice the money goes missing, not Initech. Initech has a ""Corporate Accounts Payable"" department (although at least one transcriber disagrees with me and thinks it's ""Corporate Councils Payroll"") This doesn't offer much information.  ""Accounts Payable"" is a common accounting term that any company would use.  Any kind of loan or purchase on credit would be recorded under accounts payable.  A banker would refer to it as a loan, but an accountant (or accounting software) might still call it by the more generic term. Initech has a ""Logistics"" department This could go either way.  A bank would have a logistics department, but so might a consulting company that worked for a bank. Initech has engineers who lack people skills sufficient to interface directly with their customers. Any company with an IT department has those.  In programming, a ""customer"" might be anyone who uses our software.  They can be internal or external to the company.  In my department we call the quants and bank officers who use our software to make investment decisions our customers.  Other departments write software for actual bank customers (people with checking or savings accounts).  Many of us don't talk directly with our customers.  Instead we communicate through a project manager or other intermediary. Given all of this, I think your guess of ""subsidiary of a large financial corporation"" isn't far off.  I think #4 would still eliminate a subsidiary company though.  It's unlikely that the same subsidiary would handle both software development and accounting for the parent company.  So in summary, Initech appears to be some kind of amalgam of a bank and a software consulting company that doesn't exist in the real world."
"Why doesn't ""Ralph Breaks the Internet"" have ""wreck"" in the title?","""Break the internet"" is a common phrase that's used to describe something that has become immensely popular in a short time, while ""wreck the internet"" is not a commonly used phrase (compare 1.2B Google hits for the former, and only 73M for the latter). Breaking the internet is seen as something positive for whatever broke it, while wrecking doesn't have that ironically positive connotation. It seems they did not want to mess with the set phrase."
Why is the spoken German in many US films and TV shows so inaccurate?,"As a software developer and general IT nerd, I am constantly faced with this principle. Many, many TV shows and movies forgo showing a correct approach, and opted for the most minimally correct display of IT, because they assume it's a pointless detail. I think this is the most obvious example. You don't even need to be an IT expert to understand that this is completely ridiculous. From CSI: ""I will create a GUI interface using visual basic to track the killer's IP address"". This is technical lingo, but it is pulled out of context. This is the equivalent of a car mechanic saying ""I will crank the carburator through the horsepower, so that I can clutch the shaft"". The words themselves sound thematically correct, but there is no meaning to this random succession of words. I see it happen more with IT than German (as I don't speak German), but the principle is the same: being factually correct was deemed to much of an irrelevant detail, and no one wanted to put in the effort to research the correct thing to say. Even if the script contained correct German, and the actor mistakenly messes up the grammar, it's still possible that no one catches it. If the movie is recorded in the USA with an American crew, none of them having any German speaking skill, then no one will notice that the actor said it wrongly. Secondly, in the case of more than just a single line of foreign language, actors often go to special trainers to teach them how to sound like a true German, even if only for a few lines.   Because of this, most of the people working on set will not correct the actor; since they know he has been trained to speak German and they know little or nothing about it. By comparison, they feel inadequate to highlight the (trained) actor's mistake. You've mentioned How I Met Your Mother twice. In both cases, the butchering of the German language is intentional. In the first example, HIMYM mocks the German language for having long words that sound like gibberish but actually have a very complex and nuanced meaning. If you think that's just not true, torschlusspanik. In the second example, HIMYM mocks the German language again for sounding like gibberish. Heidi Klum's presence (since she is an actual German speaker) supports this joke. If an American actor had said it, the viewers could assume that the German sounded horrible because the actor was not able to speak German. But they specifically had Heidi say it, to prevent people from thinking it was an actor's shortcoming, and therefore understanding that German is ""truly"" a gibberish language (I say ""truly"" because that is the in-universe funny truth, not the out-of-universe real truth).

Why does Darth Vader not use the Force to prevent Luke from falling?,"In his earlier conversation with Emperor, he says that either Luke will join us or die.  When Vader asks Luke to join him, he denies that.  Also, Luke was wounded and already hurt too much since his friends are captives of the Empire. Vader sees him too weak to be a Sith and since he already refused the offer, so there was no point of saving him. Though, Luke survived and he tries to capture him later. Another possibility is that he was surprised by Luke's fall, so he didn't get time to use the Force to catch him. Script Source"
Why do Disney parents usually die?,"I am answering subjectively here, but I think it really comes down to evoking even more sympathy for the main characters. Not only do they often have to battle difficult circumstances (i.e. being an outcast or something similar), but they also have to deal with being alone in the world. All of this creates genuine sympathy for the protagonists. This Daily Mail article also addressed the issue. Although they agreed with my first point, they also had this fascinating theory: Might the death of Walt Disney's mother  -  and the lifelong guilt
this left her son with  -  be the catalyst for the death of parents in
Disney? In 1938 and riding high with the proceeds from his first big
screen movie Sleeping Beauty, Walt bought his mother, Flora, and his
father, Elias, a house in LA as a golden wedding anniversary present. Within days of moving in, Flora complained about the stultifying
temperatures coming from the central heating boiler and her doting son
arranged for a swift replacement. Days later, Flora died from
asphyxiation caused by the new, poorly-installed, boiler. Might Walt
Disney's misplaced guilt over his mother's death have led him to
airbrush parents  -  mothers in particular  -  out of his works? And
has that motivation, after his death in 1966, become a Disney
blueprint? Certainly, it would explain the types of folk stories and
fairytales that Disney has acquired for adaptation, even when there
are numerous other traditional tales that feature a mother and father. Finally, it's also worth noting that not all movies have dead parents. This list shows the following Disney films as having both parents alive at the end of the film: Edit: I whipped this answer up fairly quickly and really should have expanded on a few points. As many comments under the post have indicated, this ""style"" is a common trope. As TV Tropes express (rather tongue-in-cheek): Parents Are Useless. They leave you and abuse you. Good Parents are
hard to come by. It appears that the only decent parents are the dead
ones. These are the parents that leave the characters behind, not by
choice, early on in the story, sometimes even before the story begins.
The characters are now all alone with no family. They may find a
Parental Substitute, but they may not always be the best guardians. These often heroic characters will always have fond memories of their
parents. That's because these parents did everything right while they
were alive. They spent time with their children and taught them
invaluable life lessons that they continue to keep even to this day.
Even though the parents are gone now, the actions of the parents still
affect the character and keep him going. Finally, it does make logical sense (from an animation point of view) for parents to die as it would most definitely cut down on production costs - although the life lessons learned from their deaths are obviously the main focus."

Why does Trinity's kiss revive Neo in The Matrix?,"First, a correction of a misconception. The Oracle never tells Neo he's not the one, he tells himself that. The quote from the Oracle/Neo is: Oracle: Sorry, kid. You got the gift, but it looks like you're waiting for something. Neo: What? Oracle: Your next life, maybe. Who knows? That's the way these things go. The sorry is a little ambiguous, and could easily be taken to mean ""Sorry, you're wrong on that"". However, the last part of the conversation is the important part. When Neo gets ""killed"" in the Matrix, his body is still around, and consciousness presumably hasn't departed yet. Trinity confesses that she was destined to fall in love with the One, and she loves Neo, so he couldn't be dead. This resonates with the consciousness that is still there, and he cognitively realizes and dissociates himself with the concept of death being tied to the Matrix, and is ""reborn"" in the Matrix. This fulfills all parts of the prophecy, Neo is on his ""next life"", Trinity is in love with him, and Matrix go boom."
What techniques are used by directors to make an actor cry?,"It's the same for professional as well as amateur actors - I've known some pros that have a hard time reaching the crying point. One technique includes allowing the actor to focus on the saddest memory they have, in solitude, then pull them out for the take. I recall seeing a documentary that showed Gary Oldman looking through a book of photos of his family (he had just split from Uma Thurman) on the set of Dracula that got him to the point of sorrow that Coppola wanted. I have worked with some amazing amateur actors that would work themselves up into a state before filming. One actress imagined something terrible happening to her sister, and she delivered a very powerful performance (that got the crew all choked up). If all else fails, the vapors from an onion can induce tears (but also cause redness), or a few drops of glycerin in the corners of the eyes can be released - but nothing beats real tears. I have also heard of directors bullying/belittling actors to the point of melt-down, just to get the shot they want. But that's a pretty extreme way to go about it."
Why didn't Loki's mind control work on Tony Stark?,"When Loki tries to take control of Stark he actually hits the ARC reactor and not the flesh over his heart.

In the Avengers director commentary, Joss Whedon states it fails to work because the ARC reactor prevents the staff from reaching Tony's heart."
"First example of ""ringing in ears"" sound design?","I have unashamedly copied a paragraph from this rather comprehensive article covering tinnitus as a movie trope -   The Cine-Files - The Tinnitus Trope: Acoustic Trauma In Narrative Film They are discussing silence vs. whistling noise/ringing in ears [tinnitus]  ...although Arthur Hiller’s The Out of Towners utilized the effect as
  early as 1970, onscreen ears remained mostly silent for the rest of
  the 20th century. The exceptions are few, but include important
  instances. The archetypal example of attenuated, tinnital sound
  deployed to represent wartime trauma occurs in Elem Klimov’s Come and
  See (1985), after the child-soldier protagonist survives an artillery
  barrage in a forest. Come and See is often mentioned as an influence
  on Steven Spielberg’s Saving Private Ryan (1998), which uses low-pass
  POA [Point of audition, the audio equivalent of Point of view] sound  in its first major battle and the tinnitus effect in the
  last. But while Saving Private Ryan is often mentioned as the early
  exemplar of this effect in American film, James Mangold’s Cop Land
  (1997), not only precedes it, but actually pivots psychologically and
  narratively on hearing loss and the sound of tinnitus. They have also provided a fabulous timeline...

How does the title 'The Imitation Game' justify the story of the movie?,"The other answers already draw some really good connections to various parts of Turing's work, be it movie-related or more general. But we don't really need to stop there. In fact a big emphasis of the movie, beyond the WWII spy story that already offers many possibilities for ""imitation"", is the rather personal story of Alan Turing and his struggles with being homosexual in a time where that wasn't really accepted at all. So he himself is forced to play an imitation game, imitating a straight man. (As a side-note, the subtitle to the German version of the movie, ""Ein streng geheimes Leben"" (""A top secret life""), while maybe a little bit too much on the nose, emphasises this connection further.) This is probably as valid an interpretation as the more technical ones presented in the other answers and the overall title is likely using that ambiguity for evoking meaning on multiple levels this way, just as the story itself juxtaposes Turing's personal problems with his historical achievements."
How could the Starks convince the other Lords that this character was guilty?,"This is not a democratic court; it is a royal judgment.  As Jon's nominated proxy, Sansa carries all the powers of a ""King [queen] in the North"". It is her sentence, and she does not need to seek the approval of the lords to carry it out. Littlefinger's behaviour does little to redeem him for his actions, and in some cases he outright admits the crimes levelled against him (such as the murder of Lysa Arryn, although he professes a benevolent motive). In the example above, as with all his accused crimes, the person he has to convince in order to be pardoned is Sansa Stark; and as she is accusing him of his crimes, this isn't going to happen. Sansa has her own direct experiences of Littlefinger, along with the counsel of her sister and the three-eyed Raven... and Baelish co-ordinated events that led to the rape of the proxy Queen in the north. All Sansa needed/wanted was a recent crime to provide the context for a fresh trial. Littlefinger's conspiracies were easily tantamount to this. The lords would have accepted her judgement even if Baelish hadn't confessed to his crimes, tried to flee justice etc. Edit: for the question of why the Knights of the Vale belayed the order of protection; Little-finger just admitted to murdering Lisa Arryn, their Lady Regent. He also professed his reason to be ""to protect you [Sansa]"", a claim which Sansa refutes and counters that he was acting in self interest. Regardless of motive, he just admitted Regicide. They were never his own soldiers, they were house Arryn's; and he just confessed to a Capital crime against that house. To be clear: No one in that room is going to come to Little-fingers defense unless they are compelled (through honor, duty or obligation) to react. Baelish was a necessary evil these people were being forced to endure. Little-finger believed himself to be hated, but indispensable. His power of statecraft was, however, always based on manipulation/subterfuge.  The Starks simply asked him to explain himself openly to a room full of accusers; denying him his usual method of individual manipulation. It for this reason he asks to speak to Sansa 'privately', and it is for this reason he is plainly rebuffed. Without being able to spin lies and turn actors against each other, he is powerless to defend himself against his crimes; and even admits some of them."
Jaime's character change in Game of Thrones,"TL;DR: There are a number of things that change him, but the defining moments are: These completely and totally change his character and make him determined to redeem his honour (which he himself defines) in any way that he can. Long Answer: There are a few things contributing to Jaime's colossal character change. Being away - Season 1 and start of Season 2 He is captured by Robb's army and remains a very well guarded (barring one half-escape) for over a year. During this time he's away from his sister, son and the rest of his family. Simply being away distances him from the toxic atmosphere of the Lannisters. Now, this is by far the least significant of the events that lead to his character change, but I do think its worth noting. Lady Catelyn, starting to know Brienne and honour - Season 2 When he was set free, a few things happened. Firstly, he was trusted by Lady Catelyn to return to King's Landing and free her daughters. Whilst initially it seems likely he has no intention of keeping his word, the actions of Brienne will later lead to him becoming far more concerned with keeping this promise. Secondly, Brienne was tasked to be delivered and stuck absolutely steadfast to her task. In Valar Morghulis, the Season 2 finale, she even killed Stark men, all in the name of doing the task she was set - to deliver her prisoner in her service to Lady Catelyn. This has a definite effect on Jaime - here is a woman who follows her code of honour. She is not on one side or another. Jaime appears to start thinking like this himself come Season 4 (and Season 5 and beyond). Brienne's peril and the Loss of his hand - Season 3 beginning His life is built upon his strength as a knight. Despite the subtle changes already over him in Season 2, he still tries to fight Brienne in Season 3 and break free (although whether he would have killed her if he had bested her is definitely debatable).  However, due to starvation and exhaustion (as the book is clear to point out), he is defeated. Fascinatingly, later that day, he shows one of his first genuine acts of kindness in the series - he tells Brienne she will be raped that night, and that she should not resist, or they will kill her as she is nothing to them.  Whilst this may seem cold or hurtful, it's also truthful. He realised what could befall her and didn't want it to happen. He even goes as far as to lie about how her homeland, The Sapphire Isle, got its name (saying it's because of all the sapphires). This leaves the men to leave her alone in the hope of getting a ransom. Already, it's clear that something about Brienne has gripped him. Perhaps she reminds him of a young Jaime? Despite this, he has certainly not changed yet. Instead, at this point, he simply appears to have some sort of grudging respect for her. Everything changes when he loses his hand. This was his greatest asset. He was a colossal fighter, the youngest ever Kingsguard member - and losing his hand stripped him of everything he had spent his life fighting for in a single swoop. He begins moping, and is furiously berated by Brienne for acting like a woman. Despite her fierce criticism, he actually follows her advice. She helps him beginning eating and drinking again. Once more, her strength and commitment to honour appears to sway him. The Truth about the Mad King and Jaime - Season 3 - defining moment of change The bath scene at Harrenhal, in Kissed by Fire is his defining moment of change. After slipping into a bath with Brienne, and initially insulting her, he completely opens up and tells her (and the audience, for the first time), the true story of the Mad King... One of Jaime's biggest frustrations is the lack of respect he is given. He served under the Mad King, in the Kingsguard - the youngest ever member of the order. However, he learned (and we learn in A Storm of Swords) that he was chosen as a slight against Lord Tywin, so he wouldn't be the heir to Casterly Rock. Despite this, he remained in the Kingsguard. We learn from the books in particular how difficult it was for him during this time. For example, when Brandon and Lord Rickard Stark (father of Ned) were murdered, he had to be reminded by Ser Gerold Hightower that he swore an oath to guard the king, not to judge him. Finally, when Rhaegar and Robert go to war, and it becomes clear The Targarayens will lose, The Mad King orders the city be set ablaze. He also orders Jaime to bring him his father Lord Tywin's head. This is the last straw for Jaime, who turns his back on his King and slaughters him. He could not stand by and watch the entire city be destroyed, and so many people to perish. His reward? The title Kingslayer and an almost universal disdain for turning his back on the person he swore to protect. He broke his honour, and should have died protecting him, according to his oaths. This disdain and lack of respect led to resentment which continued to bubble inside him, making him crueller and more callous. I think this is the true final moment of change for Jaime. It's not that he becomes a good person. It's not that all his sins are forgiven. It's just that something inside changes and from that point on becomes linked to Brienne and determined to keep a sense of honour. When he collapses at the end of his story, she cries out for help for the Kingslayer - and he corrects her. His name is Jaime. Rescuing Brienne - Season 3 ending After leaving Harrenhal for the capital, Jaime realises what is going to happen to Brienne, who has been left behind. He demands his group returns and rescues her from a bear, in a hideous gladatorial battle she's been forced into. Together, they depart for King's Landing.  For the first time, he has been able to save her.  And he's actually done something honourable, which she appreciates - it's the first genuine appreciation he has had in a long time, and continues to change how he views both Brienne and the world. New sense of honour and distancing from Lannisters - Season 4 beginning This continues in Season 4, when he returns to the capital, but refuses his father's orders to leave King's Landing. He chooses to stay in the Kingsguard, to protect the King. Of course, with his stump hand he's of little use - it's his name and the legend of his fighting which affords him his respect. But, inspired by Brienne, he is determined to stay and redeem any honour he can. In one of the more memorable scenes in Season 4, he has sex/rapes Cersei, next to Joffrey's body. This is unquestionably one of the most tortured and complex scenes of the series. At that moment, he both loves her and hates her. It's a connection to the long past he has, and yet a reminder of how far away from her he now is. He even tells her: ""You're a hateful woman, why have the gods condemned me to love a
  hateful woman?!?"" This moment forever changes their relationship. When next they meet, he is trying to convince her of Tyrion's innocence and is kicked out of her room. The dynamic between them (as of yet) has never recovered. The action is brutal and horrendous. It shows his change, but also shows how cruel and cold he can still be. It's another reminder that the world of Game of Thrones is not simply good versus bad. Brienne's departure and a commitment to the future - Season 4 mid to end At the start of Season 4, Jaime refuses to release Sansa to Brienne - but only because by this stage Lady Catelyn and Robb are dead and he genuinely believes she will be safer in the capital.  When Joffrey dies though, Tyrion is arrest and Sansa is missing, he knows she is a prime suspect and is in grave danger. Jaime sends Brienne, with new weapons and armour, on a mission to find Sansa and protect her - especially from his sister. This poignant scene reminds us of both how much he now respects and trusts her Brienne, and contrasts starkly with how much he distrusts his own sister, whom he pined over for so long whilst being captive. His final act of honour in Season 4 is to rescue Tyrion from a fate he knows he doesn't deserve, setting in action a complex range of events that you'll see in Season 5 (and that will be continued beyond). Conclusion He is a wonderfully complex and bizarre character, with varying and often confusing attitudes towards both violence and other people. To quote from the GoT Wiki: Jaime's attitude towards violence is also complex: he threw Bran Stark
  out a tower window to kill him, but later saved Brienne from being
  raped (and then fed to a bear) by Locke's soldiers. The difference
  seems to be that after witnessing the deprivations [sic] of the Mad King,
  needless violence and brutality deeply offend Jaime, though if he
  decides that violence and murder are absolutely necessary he will
  ruthlessly carry it out himself. He threw Bran out of a window because
  had the boy reported that he saw the incest between Jaime and his
  sister, Cersie, the woman he loved, and all of their children would be
  executed, so he felt he had no choice. There is nothing simplistic about his character, but the one clear thing is his hatred of the lack of respect he is given for killing the Mad King. If Ned or Robert had done it, they would be heroes. Because he did it, breaking his oath, he is treated with contempt. When he meets Brienne though, loses his hand and finally confides in someone what he did and why, he changes. The look in Brienne's eyes during his speech tells a story too - suddenly his actions have a very different meeting. This is the defining moment after which he completely changes. He is still ruthless, but rather than following his family's code of honour, he appears to follow his own - largely inspired by his adventure with Brienne."
Why were people led to believe that the Apollo mission was fake in Interstellar?,"They were led to believe the moon landing was faked in order to socially engineer the public into living a sustainable lifestyle. With the Blight having devastated Earth so much that the population is believed to be around 300 million, and food a scarce commodity still, the world governments decided that the consumerist, capitalistic belief systems were not good for society. The general belief that NASA faked the moon landings, along with all the other changes that society has gone through, is used to acclimate the general public into a system of belief of survival of the group over the benefit of the individual. Multiple times throughout the movie we are told that this is the ideal thought process of the modern man. This is why Cooper's son is pushed towards farming. This is why Murph is ridiculed in school. This is why Professor Brand pushes Coop and Brand Jr. into Plan B through deception. Because that type of thinking moves people away from a sustainable Earth, meaning people die from lack of resources. First the teachers, spouting the propaganda of the day: If we don't want a repeat of the excess and wastefulness of the 20th century, then...
  ...we need to teach our kids about this planet, not tales of leaving it. Then Brand: He knew how hard it would be to get people to work together to save the species instead of themselves.
  Or their children. You never would've come unless you believed you would save them.
  Evolution has yet to transcend that simple barrier. We can care deeply, selflessly about those we know, but that empathy rarely extends beyond our line of sight. He was prepared to destroy his own humanity in order to save the species. The entire point being that The needs of the many, outweigh the needs of the few, or the one. I mean, the wants and desires of the few are dwarfed by the need for the species to survive. It was to curtail individual wants and excess. That's why Tom was forced into farming, when his aptitude showed promise that society no longer encouraged in the modern crisis. While it's beneficial for most of society to focus on survival, on extending the human race's existence, it's also important to look for solutions to the problem. Farming is a stop-gap, keeping humanity alive. Expanding into space is the solution, to allow humanity to THRIVE. Politics gets in the way and limits funding, but they were still funded enough to the point we see in the film. And as Brand does, people are tricked into helping because the greater good calls for them to be tricked. A person is smart. People are dumb, panicky dangerous animals, and you know it."

Why the highlighted outline in animated cartoons?,"This is due to how hand-drawn animation used to be made. A static background was drawn only once, and the moving objects were drawn for each frame on a transparent cel. Then it was placed on the background, one frame was shot on film, then the cel was removed, and new one was placed on the same background, next frame was shot, and so on. If an object wasn't moving, it was a part of the background. If it is to be animated, it is no longer part of the background and has to be now drawn on the cel to be moved in each frame. Drawings on the cels, as seen on the picture are outlined with ink and that is why they seem highlighted or standing out from the background.

"Where and when does the ""idea"" light bulb appear for the first time?","Where does this metaphor come from? The term ""bright"" to mean ""clever"" seems to have originated/evolved in the 18th century.. By the mid 1700s, the term was being said to describe children who were clever or displayed an intelligence remarkable for their age. A hundred years on, the word meant a combination of all these, a meaning akin to our modern understanding of the word. Source for all references When the lightbulb was invented... In the late 19th century, before the development of practical techniques to reproduce photographs on the printed page, illustrations and cartoons were a mainstay of newspapers worldwide. Editors would commission illustrations to depict events described in the articles, or to easily express a point of view. Early reports of Edison’s success with the electric light bulb were often illustrated with drawings a dark room illuminated by a single lamp.  As the bulb’s success became more and more apparent, Edison himself quickly became a celebrity. Many drawings and photographs from the time, depict Edison leaning against a workbench, holding an electric light bulb. These iconic photographs of Edison, the so called “Wizard of Menlo Park,” equated the inventor’s prolific output with the light bulb in the public’s mind. The bulb came to stand for all of Edison’s inventive prowess.  As a symbolic representation of Edison’s slew of new ideas, it wasn’t long before the the symbol came to be associated with the concept of new ideas generically. Edison’s improvement of the electric light coincided with the world’s new understanding of the of the word to describe someone, or something, as intelligent and inventive. That Edison’s electric light bulbs were also bright like the sun, also helped to connect and cement these two concepts as analogous concepts in the minds of the public. What is the first movie/cartoon/show that used it for the first time? Then came along Felix  In the early twentieth century, Felix the Cat was the world’s favorite animated animal. Created more than a decade prior to Mickey Mouse, Felix was the most popular cartoon character of the silent-film era. The anthropomorphic black cat, with his white eyes and a giant grin, was unable to speak because of the limitations of the medium, but Felix’s emotions and thoughts were projected both through his exaggerated movements, and through various kinds of physical manifestations. When Felix was thinking, symbols and letters would sometimes appear over his head, and he would often use them as props: question marks became ladders, and musical notes became vehicles. It was in these symbolic images that we first see the light bulb used to represent a new idea."
Is there a full canon version of Tyrion's jackass/honeycomb joke?,"As far as I know Tyrion only tries to tell the joke thrice and each time is interrupted almost as soon as he begins. In season 1 episode 6, ""A Golden Crown"", at his trial he barely gets the opening line out of the way: Tyrion: I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel... Much later on in season 6 episode 8, ""No One"", he doesn't get much further: Tyrion: I once walked into a brothel with a honeycomb and a jackass. The madam says... Lastly, in season 8 episode 6, ""The Iron Throne"", the scene ends with him starting it. Tyrion: I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel. So, the answer to is there a canonical answer is no. If you want some possibilities of what it could be, I know of a few; here are a couple from this reddit thread. Tyrion walks into a brothel with a honeycomb and a jackass. Madame: What can we do for you? Tyrion: I need a woman to lay with, for mine has left me. Madame: Whatever for? And what's with the honeycomb and the mule? Tyrion: My woman found a genie in a bottle, and he granted her three wishes. The first was for a house fit for a queen, so he gave her this damn honeycomb. The second wish was that she have the nicest ass in all the land, so he gave her this damn donkey... Madame: And what about the third wish? Tyrion: Well... she asked the genie to make my cock hang down past my knee. Madame: Well that one's not so bad eh? Tyrion: Not so bad!? I used to be six foot three! I once took a honeycomb and a jackass into a brothel, and the madam asked me what I wanted. I said I would like to trade the honeycomb for a meal, and the jackass for a night with the most beautiful woman. She asked me why I did not simply eat the honeycomb. I said the same reason I want to trade the jackass, I'm tired of having the same thing every night."
What is the longest aired episode of a TV series?,"The final of Muhteşem Yüzyıl (The Magnificent Century) is 157 minutes without commercials. The final episode is on Youtube and it is a historical fiction series according to Wikipedia. It is very common for Turkish TV series for 2 hours or more each episode. 
The final episode of each season even lasts longer.  TV channels generally air a shortened version / recap of the previous episode first. This generally takes 1 hour. After that airs 2 to 3 hours of the show. Including the commercials a single episode takes around 4 hours each night.  Also there are nearly 40 episodes each season. Note these numbers are not exceptions, it is the current pattern for popular channels now in Turkey.  Others:

What makes The Shawshank Redemption so cinematically important?,"I believe it is due to its great acting and very memorable plot. I'm not aware of any widely-used cinematic techniques that were invented due to the film.  When the film was initially released, it struggled at the box office (it earned just $727,000 in its opening weekend). Despite this it received huge critical acclaim, garnered seven Oscar nominations and the rest was history - it's simply become one of the most popular, beloved films of all time. Quite why this occurred is due to a number of reasons: It just touches on so many wonderful, magical issues and that has continued to resonate with audiences ever since. As Tim Robbins (i.e. Andy) himself said: 'All I know...is that there isn't a day when I'm
  not approached about that film - approached by people who say how
  important that film is to them, who tell me that they've seen it 20,
  30, 40 times, and who are just so... thankful.'"
Why do mouse cursors never align with actors' hand movements (or always move perfectly straight)?,"The reality is that these images are nearly universally added in post production. Creating a computer environment for a film that the actors can actually interact with is much more time intensive and expensive than just creating an animation of the screen. Even if they did so, it would be time consuming to have to reset the computer screen to clear out whatever the actor did... so it's easier to just do it in post.  Another reason, which some of the other answers pointed out is that, particularly with CRT screens, the refresh rate of the screen would often be picked up on camera. This is something I remember a lot from shows in the past. It's less of an issue with modern screens but there can still be some issues. Here's an example of what it looks like, an explanation of why it exists and actually a method for getting rid of it: 

 The easy way to avoid this is the same method as before, use a green screen. While it's sometimes possible to change the screen refresh rate, it's not always the case and it's not always possible to set it to match your recording media. Unfortunately, as many computer programmers are aware, in most films and TV shows, it's pretty obvious that the person who's creating the computer environment generally knows very little about computers at all. As such, you end up with unnatural behavior like mouse movement along a straight line, and ""programming"" environments that look nothing like the reality. This generally has been getting better in recent times - likely because we're becoming more and more beholden to computers and are more likely to recognize that this is an issue. All that being said, other than relaxing and not paying attention, there's not much to do about it on your end. Much as the extremely straight flight lines in Indiana Jones annoy me, you have to just ignore them a bit. Remind yourself that movies aren't reality and that, maybe, in their reality, mouse cursors do move in a straight line. "

Why does Bane's stock exchange robbery actually work to bankrupt Bruce Wayne?,"You are actually completely right. This is plot hole, probably because of rushed writing. In real life such a 'coup' would never have succeeded. Any and all transactions done in such a fraudulent way, would indeed be blocked or the ones that went through would be canceled afterwards. There are plenty of witnesses that can say that Bane =/= Bruce Wayne. This scene was counting on, that no one would know the slightest bit of how a stock exchange works... and that plan failed. What's worse is that even the type of transaction performed was incorrect for the intended purpose. Bane purchased puts, a type of insurance against dropping prices that allows you to sell your shares at a certain price even if the market price is lower. Since Bane's attack on the stock exchange would certainly cause a serious drop in prices or even a market crash, these puts are suddenly worth a lot more, than if the market would have continued as usual. Wayne Enterprises would in such a case have lost a lot less than other companies. Talk about a failure on all accounts. Source: The Atlantic"
Why don't they show subtitles for the Spanish dialogue?,"It's a deliberate directorial device.

"Is Borden's true identity real, or another ruse?","While this is an interesting idea (and one which others have brought up on this site before, but I'm glad someone finally turned this into a proper question), I think it contradicts both the movie's plot and its overall themes. So no, I don't think there is much evidence in favor of this theory, but there is IMHO very well evidence against it, even if not so hard an evidence (and interpretation is still a free good). As you yourself stated in your question, Borden and his twin both lived half a life for their entire life. And in turn this is ""their real trick and shows true dedication to their art"". This is what actually distinguishes Borden from Angier, who always tried to go the easy way and couldn't even imagine devoting his entire life to ""just a magic trick"". That is why Angier doesn't get behind the old Chinese magician's trick and Borden immediately realizes it, because the Chinese magician also devoted his entire non-stage life to keeping up the actual trick, like Borden did. And this is also the reason why Angier cannot believe Borden to just use a double for his Transported Man, since his own attempts with a double were not that fruitful and didn't work that well in the end, since he just wanted to do it the fast and easy way. So he thought there must be more to it than such a simple secret, but ""The secret impresses no one, the trick you use it for is everything"" (which might in the end even be the reason why you yourself think there to be more to Borden's trick, he achieved to deceive you, too ;-)). So given this major theme of dedicating his whole life to his art in contrast to going the  fast and easy way to just to do a good show, Borden also using a cloning machine wouldn't really fit that well. And in the end Tesla himself said he never built such a thing, and while we might not believe him, he didn't have so much reason to lie at this point (having previously claimed to have built it until Angier finds out he didn't). And even more important, what would be the reason for Borden to send  Angier to Tesla if he knew he could build such a thing, since it was always planned as a distraction for Angier? While the coincidence might strike you as too coincidental, Borden sending him to the actual goal and just pretending it to be a wild goose chase would be much more of a plot-inconsistency. This also doesn't fit to Borden's reaction on this whole setup. He was as surprised as you and me that Angier actually ""survived"" the supposed murder, so he had absolutely no idea that Angier had a machine for cloning himself, which wouldn't be the case had he known that Tesla could construct such a device. So that being said let's take a look at Tesla's significance as keyword and the supposed coincidence. There is still a reason for Tesla being used as keyword while coincidentally being able to build that machine, even if not as impressive a reason. In the movie he once was at a science fair or something similar in London, which both Angier and Borden attended as spectators. Borden might very well have seen Angier there and might have seen that Angier was impressed by Tesla's rather innovative science (that might have seemed like magic at that time), while all the others literally ran away in fear. So he thought Tesla might be someone that Angier could really believe to have built such a ""magic"" machine, which made him a reasonable keyword, given that he lived so far away. The fact that Tesla could in the end really build such a thing was a coincidence Borden did not anticipate, and was actually an homage to Nikola Tesla's genius, using a bit of an overfictionalized version of the actual historical person. While not being an expert in this topic I know that even the real Tesla has a reputation for being quite an innovative person who had ideas that didn't get the respect or appreciation they deserved at their time (even if a duplication machine was maybe a bit over the top even for him), which also fits to his mythical introduction in the movie and his overall impressing presence (amazingly incarnated by noone else than David Bowie). So if anyone could have built such a machine at this time it would be Tesla and Borden might have been aware of this fact (even if he underestimated him and didn't really deem it possible) and assumed that Angier thought the same. So the writer of the script (or rather the novel it was based on) payed his tribute to the real Nicola Tesla by letting his fictional version achieve true scientific magic, while presenting quite a surprising, well yeah, coincidence to the audience. It wasn't so much a coincidence more than Borden and all of us just underestimating the genius of Nikola Tesla, like real history might have done, too."
The most roles played by the same actor in a movie?,"I don't know the answer. But here's a potential candidate.

Point of the Dothraki's attack in GoT S8E3?,"The point was to demonstrate that the writers had no clue what they were doing, should probably not be allowed to write about battles again, and should not be trusted with managing ""logistical"" based plot lines... And about the best 'logical' reason to have it done would be ""To avoid paying for so many horses/GCI for the rest of the season."" Attempting to read too much into the battle 'strategy' from that episode is a highly questionable effort, given that they also decided to trap infantry on the far side of all the defensive lines, rather than even attempting to use the prepared defenses to slow the opponent such that they would be easier to kill. [You know, the entire reason why people build stuff like staked ditches and castle walls?] It was a sadder Hollywood Farce of War than the number of characters who run around battles without helmets.

"Why does the roadrunner say ""beep beep""?","As explained on Wikipedia: Chuck Jones, the creator of the Road Runner, has stated that this sound, the only way the Road Runner can harm the Coyote, was inspired by hearing a Doppler-like effect as background artist Paul Julian imitated a car horn when he could not see where he was going. The source for this claim is a DVD commentary, in which Michael Barrier says: Actually the title is somewhat of a misnomer; the actual 'beep beep' sound you just heard the Road Runner make was made by a background painter named Paul Julian, who used to make it in the hallways at Warner Brothers when he was carrying a large painting along, so people would get out of his way. Chuck Jones heard him make that - or Treg Brown I guess, actually, the sound effects wizard at Warner Brothers - heard him make that noise and suggested that they record that for the Road Runner, and it's been the standard Road Runner noise ever since. Note that the sound is also spelled ""meep, meep"", ""hmeep hmeep"" or ""mweep, mweep""."
"Why does ""No-one ever get it in the first take""?","So… why can't the actors just get it right the first time? Well, quite often they can. They are professionals, they do this all day, every day. They have learned how to learn lines, follow direction, and 'do the job they're paid to do'.
Of course, no-one is going to do this first time, every time, but why can't they do it even sometimes? They know their lines, they've blocked the scene. What could possibly go wrong? Let's take a simple scene.
We have just two principals. They walk towards each other, stand face to face in conversation, then part ways. In the background there are a few indistinguishable passers-by. To keep this as basic as possible for this scenario, the scene will be shot as one wide, so the audience can see the entirety of the setting, then two simple over-the-shoulder-shots, one from behind each principal looking at the other as they speak. (This is not oscar-winning stuff, I'm keeping it simple.) The wide will be shot first, as this then becomes a master template for where everyone and everything was at any given moment. The director takes everyone through 'blocking' first.
This is when the actors run through their lines, not really acting, just speaking them out loud to feel the pace. The director decides the timing and positions each needs to be in to convey their vision of the final scene. At this point camera may not even be in position, nor lighting. These choices will be made simultaneously or shortly after. The director will give their indication as to how each setup will work and many other people will then be assigned their part of the task to ensure that can be realised. Camera position, lighting and everything else that will be 'seen' in each setup - props, supporting actors, 'art department' which can cover everything not covered by the above - furniture, curtains, practical lights (practicals are any light that is part of the scene itself, like a desk lamp). There may come a point where all techs are asked to clear so camera can ""have a look"", before further finessing. This is the first time everyone will really be seeing the shot as it is to become. The Director of Photography (DoP) will be working with camera and lighting to ensure the scene will look how the director wishes. The camera operator will be working with their two assistants (called AC - assistant camera - 1 and 2 in US parlance, Focus-puller and Clapper loader in UK, though these terms are merging these days).
AC 1 will need measurements to each focus point for the whole scene. Camera has very accurate measuring these days, just like your own consumer camera or phone, but no self-respecting AC1 will ever rely on that;) AC1 uses a remote control focussing device with measured rings which they can mark with distances. They watch via a dedicated portable monitor on a stand, just for them. For a long walk into shot, they will get one of the second team (stand-in) to walk the route and will physically measure, with a good old-fashioned reel of cloth tape, and mark points on the ground down the route. Principals by now will have likely finished blocking and will have been stepped off. The second team will be in place now, whilst the techs are doing all this measurement, checking how the lighting looks on camera and making adjustments. Once this is just about all ready to go, then the 3rd Assistant Director (3rd AD) and their assistants (all confusingly called ""thirds"") will bring in the supporting artists ('extras') and place them; give them moves to be timed either against dialog if it can be heard from there, or by counting off seconds (called 'beats' but you can consider them seconds) mentally if not. So, everyone is just about in place.
The principals are called back to set and the second team goes to watch playback on the monitors in the ""video village"". Stand ins (2nd team) need to be able to see the scene unfold in case any large changes are to be made and they are called back to set. They need to know what, if anything, has changed since they were last on. We're ready for a rehearsal take.
Camera goes up (""Lights, camera, action"" - no-one ever says this, but the precursor to a take is a topic all of its own) and the scene is run.
The director or DoP may need to make changes, big or small, then a second rehearsal take, rarely a third… and then, after no more than a couple of hours since we all walked onto set - we're ready for a take!! The first AD shouts ""final checks"" and 20 more people rush in, making sure everyone's hair is exactly right, costume, people are holding the right props, etc. When everyone is happy, off they all scurry again, and now we're ready to go. ""Going for a take… Lights, camera, action"" Everybody knows what they're doing, where to be, the lights are up, camera is happy.
What could possibly go wrong? Well… everything and anything. The director has to get this right.
Now everything has settled down, we're really starting to see the true direction the scene is taking; how it shapes, how the actors' positions and camera focus affect the feel of the shot. ""Can we just move your mark forwards a couple of inches?""
AC1 has to run in to move a little T-shape of gaffa tape on the floor so the principal knows where to stand next time. ""I don't like how that SA crosses picture just on the vital line.""
It's communicated to the 3rd AD that the passer's timing needs adjusting, or that they take a different route. ""It's a bit bright just over there.""
The DoP and lighting gaffer arrange to have a light moved, or a flag dropped in to shade it a bit. ""Could we just pace up the pan as [actor] walks in, so we arrive before he does?""
Camera op makes a mental note and shows the move to the director a couple of times. ""I think we should pull focus just on that line so Actor B is sharp instead of actor A""
AC2 makes some more measurements. Checks with Camera op and director. ""There's a water bottle in shot"" (or coffee cup, or script, or Volkswagen Beetle…) ""I can see a 'florry' in reflection""
Camera has spotted something reflecting in a window or a mirror, or a car, or a bottle, or… anything reflective; something that should not be seen. ""Florries"" are anyone wearing a bright yellow fluorescent jacket,  usually security, locations, or facilities. ""I think we perhaps ought to change that line to emphasise just how much [actor] loves/hates/doesn't care about xyz.""
Actor tries to remember new instruction (any changes to an actor from the director is known as 'notes' even if no-one ever writes them down)
Script Supervisor (previously known as Continuity) does write them down. …and off we go for take two.
No-one got anything 'wrong', no-one made a mistake, just it wasn't all quite exactly perfect. The principal actors, through all this, just stand patiently waiting for the next take, or until the 1st AD shouts ""Moving on"" to the next setup - thereby indicating the director was happy (in parlance, ""they bought that one"").
As this is only the wide shot, the actors haven't even come up to full 'speed' yet. They're going to save the truly emotional drain the scene might have for their own close-up. That's the one that matters in the end. We spent maybe two or more hours (my record is 5 hours, from crew call to first roll, with Tim Burton) getting far enough into the process to even go for the first take. Why would anyone stop right there?
Many of these decisions are artistic not technical. The director needs to always remain aware that the final shape of the movie may not be as initially intended, so some leeway in interpretation may be required. Take 1 might just be the one they use in the final cut, but so much time has been invested getting to take 1 that multiple takes make sense, even if there are no technical issues, only artistic."
Is Amy right about Indiana Jones being irrelevant to the outcome?,"I don't believe Amy is correct, and it relates to a scene that isn't in the movie.  We know that the nazis had the wrong length staff because they only had one side of the head piece.  Other posters have argued whether or not the nazis obtain the head piece from Marion without him...let's assume they do... I don't remember where I heard this but there's a scene that's not in the movie.  The second side of the head piece contains more info than just the 'correct' staff length.  Also written on the back side are instructions not to look into the Ark...this is how Indy knows to 'KEEP YOUR EYES SHUT' when the Ark is opened.  Indy learns this when he and Sallah have the head piece translated...don't know why this was left out of the movie...bad dates, maybe. Anyway, without Indy, either a) they never find the ark because they don't get the head piece without him, or b) they obtain the ark with the complete head piece but aren't killed by it because they have the instructions not to look at it. Sorry, Amy.  "

Why did cars in 70s and 80s TV and movies slide like they were driving on ice?,"North American car design of that era was geared toward a smooth ride in a straight line (Interstate highway) while European cars were made for handling twisting, turning roads. Think Daytona 500 vs. European rally racing. Radial tyres had not saturated the North American market. Bias-ply tyres (with less cornering traction) were still prevalent throughout the 1970s and into the 1980s. Electronic traction control was non-existent. Even anti-sway bars that provided a mechanical advantage to the roll experienced in a sharp corner were considered a racing accessory. Stunt drivers would often oversteer a vehicle causing the rear to lose traction and swing out on a corner. This ‘fish-tail’ maneuver would provide the illusion of speed. This driving exercice is not isolated to the 1970-80s; I am still amazed at how slow many chase vehicles are traveling yet still manage to skid their rear wheels out in a basic cornering maneuver then over-correct as the rear wheels swing back. At least most movies have budgets that can hire stunt drivers who can perform a controlled drift properly."
What are TPS Reports?,"TEST PROGRAM SET  According to director Mike Judge, TPS reports stand for Test Program Set in the movie. I guess I can settle this once and for all,"" Mike Judge, the movie's
  writer and director, said of the dreaded report his protagonist, Peter
  Gibbons, failed to attach a cover sheet to, despite his eight bosses'
  memo to do so. ""When I was an engineer, it stood for Test Program Set.
  Isn't that exciting?"" In popular culture, TPS Reports are defined as mindless paperwork in an office environment: After its use in the comedic 1999 film Office Space, ""TPS report"" has
  come to connote pointless, mindless paperwork, and an example of
  ""literacy practices"" in the work environment that are ""meaningless
  exercises imposed upon employees by an inept and uncaring management""
  and ""relentlessly mundane and enervating"". According to the film's
  writer and director Mike Judge, the abbreviation stood for ""Test
  Program Set"" in the movie. In the movie, multiple managers and
  coworkers inquire about a single error that Peter Gibbons makes in
  utilizing a wrong cover sheet to send his TPS reports. It is used by
  Gibbons as an example that he has eight different persons he directly
  reports to. There is also a definition in the urban dictionary regarding TPS reports defining them as Total Pointless Stuff (among other things)."
Why did they avoid Charlie's name in the film title Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory?,"What was the reason for the shift from Charlie to Willy Wonka in the film title? NAACP (The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, a civil rights organization in the United States to advance justice for African Americans) had the objection on the portrayal of the characters in the book. They didn't approve the book, therefore, they didn't want this film to encourage the sale of that book. They suggested to make Oompa-Loompas white and alter the film title. Filmmakers decided to call the new bar the Wonka Bar and changing the title to Willy Wonka as a promotional tie-in. Is it not more of Charlie's journey in the film? Is it for the hint to any supposed deviation from novel to film in the film? Yes, it is, but they put more emphasis on Willy than Charlie. The author of the original book wasn't happy with the film. From BBC, A cast of suitably bratty children, Oscar-nominated songs by Anthony Newley and a disturbing, psychedelic boat ride sequence did not prevent Dahl feeling “disappointed” in the movie. “He thought it placed too much emphasis on Willy Wonka and not enough on Charlie,” said Liz Attenborough, trustee of the Roald Dahl Museum and Story Centre in Buckinghamshire. “For him the book was about Charlie.” From Screen Rant, The NAACP had been critical of Dahl’s portrayal of the characters in the book, and they put pressure on the production to alter their appearance, saying in a statement that: “The objection to the title Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is simply that the NAACP doesn’t approve of the book, and therefore doesn’t want the film to encourage sales of the book. The solution is to make the Oompa-Loompas white and to make the film under a different title.” From MentalFloss, Though the book is called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, the 1971 movie is named after Willy Wonka. There are two reasons for this: When the NAACP was protesting the Oompa-Loompas, they also demanded that the movie’s title be changed so as not to promote the book among viewers of the movie. The second reason for shifting the main character focus was because the movie was financed by Quaker Oats, who were looking at it as a way of advertising a new line of chocolate bars that they were about to produce. Eventually, they settled on calling the new bar the Wonka Bar, and with that they chose to rename the entire movie after Willy Wonka as a promotional tie-in. (Because really, what better way is there to sell candy bars than with the suggestion of light cannibalism?)"
In Fight Club is Marla Singer a second figment of Jack's imagination?,"And here is why. Throughout the movie, she does have a certain ring about her that would allude her to the same appearance as Tyler. A mechanism to cope with him exploiting the groups by introducing a woman into the mix.  She is inherently, a real person in terms of the movie. Probably the most obvious reference to her reality is this scene where the waiter acknowledges both the existence of The Narrator (Jack from here on out) and Marla sitting together at the table  In that case sir may I advise against the lady eating the clam chowder... That article does reference a great counterpoint, stating that they know he is insane and compensate for it by making sure to continue Project Mayhem on their own even with a direct ""Stop"" order from him.  But I counter with a fact of how does the waiter know this is another personality, let alone female in nature?  The answer is, her physical existence.   Her existence is acknowledged more than most people take into consideration.  If it was really Jack approaching the group after several meetings just asking  This is cancer, right? They would approach with more smiles and laughter on their face than surprise and disgust that a woman is joining their male support group.  Not to mention the fact that Bob would recognize ""Cornelius"" instantly.  Also, the other scene where they are embracing each other the proctor (leader?) of the group would have said something about Jack being alone hugging the air and hug him herself or some cheesy thing like that.  It is nigh on impossible that she would let him stand there alone (assuming Marla's non-existence) in a group that helps others cope with such strong emotions. Quick point here that if Marla is selling the clothes and she looks at Jack when Bowel Cancer is involved, why wouldn't she just look at Marla instead? This is also the point that the article doesn't bring up in any great detail as it drives a train through this theory. The simple premise of Project Mayhem members actively tracking down Marla and bringing her to Jack is shown as the ultimate proof of her existence.  It is one thing to allow your leader to have his little insane quirks of talking to himself, contradicting himself, even fighting himself.  But to bring his actual alter ego to him is quite impossible.  Let alone finding who she is if they have seen her before and know her exact description Ladies and gentleman of the Jury, I submit with the aforementioned evidence, that Marla Singer is REAL An aside: The book itself reveals a bit more to her existence than the movie does.  Marla is a real person as it is because he sees her with a support group he decided to erase Tyler from existence in order to prevent him from ruining Marla's life further and then shoots himself when he thinks everything else is hopeless after the bomb fails. The restaurant scene is also there but with more interaction between her and the waiter. I applaud the movie in that it allows one to have this theory of Marla, vs her portrayal in the book where it is much more obvious that she is a real person. Another aside that struck my mind reading that article is how the house is actually a physical representation of Jack's psyche.  I disagree in the physical part because then it can be argued that anyone that joined Fight Club and later PM is just another  alternate personality of his.  I do like thinking it is more of a symbolic representation, however, which fits a lot better."
"How do productions like Stranger Things or other similarly ""not modern but still within recent memory"" productions acquire period props?","Wired actually has an article about this: ... To get the amazing '80s stuff, Reiss scoured eBay, flea markets, prop rentals, and estate sales in Georgia. (The series is set in suburban Indiana but shot in Atlanta.) Her budget for the season was around $220,000. ... Reiss has a warehouse full of props on the Isle of Man, but almost everything for Stranger Things was bought or made for the show. When filming wrapped, everything was inventoried and put into storage in Georgia. So the answer is, that it depends, and will vary from production to production, and also most likely from season to season as production staff change.  Some shows will have a high level of detail required, which is what Reiss on Stranger Things was held to, while other production staff may take it easier and just buy replicas that aren't exactly the same."

Can a single bullet from a handgun kill three people in the way Deadpool did?,"One bullet, two deer killed: A few years ago, a 10 year old boy on his first hunting trip killed two deer with one round. One bullet, two men killed: In 2009, a British sniper in Afghanistan killed two suspected insurgents who were fleeing on a motorcycle;  the bullet passed through the heads of both men. The Barrett .50 BMG anti-matériel rifle fires an enormous bullet - far too big for any handgun - but we're talking about a round traveling a mile, passing through a 10"" thick wall, passing through one person, then passing through another.  The human skull is only 1/4 inch thick, so passing in and out of 3 skulls in succession would mean traveling through 1.5 inches of bone.  At close range, a handgun of average firepower could do this quite easily. One bullet, seven wounds, one man killed, one wounded: One of the bullets that hit John F. Kennedy entered the back of his neck, exited from the front of his throat, went into Governor Connally's back, out his chest, then into his forearm and out through his wrist, finally lodging just below the skin of his thigh. Along the way, this bullet damaged one of Kennedy's vertebrae, shattered one of Connally's ribs, and broke a bone in Connally's wrist.  Thus we see that bullets have considerable momentum, and can often punch through multiple surfaces/victims, doing extensive damage on the way, before coming to rest. One bullet, five wounds, one man killed: An autopsy on a boy in India showed that he had died in an accidental shooting, and the bullet had caused five wounds (link:  warning - extremely graphic):  it entered below his knee, exited above it, entered his hand, exited his wrist, and finally, entered his chest. One bullet, 17 wounds, 9 men hit: It is said that an imperialist adventurer once tied 12 Unangan men together in Alaska and fired a single round from his rifle at them.  The round passed through eight of the men, lodging in the ninth. Deadpool isn't firing an anti-matériel rifle, nor is he firing the .50 BMG, but he has the next best thing:  his primary weapons are a pair of IWI Desert Eagle Mark XIX .50 handguns.  These are among the most powerful handguns ever made, and they have more than enough muscle to do the job. Give him an infinite supply of ammunition and perfectly lined up skulls and he can score 3-for-1 shots all day long.  The only tricky part would be a real life scenario in which the targets are running around doing everything in their power to avoid being shot. As Voo generously said in a comment: I used this calculator to get the kinetic energy of the bullet used in the Kennedy shooting (162grains, 1700fps) - 1410 joules). The desert eagle has a maximum muzzle velocity of 150fps and there's 325 grain heavy ammunition for it. So from a close enough distance at least the energy would be more than enough And Dan Neely added: The 9mm (362 joules) and .45 ACP (432) are the mainstay defensive handgun rounds in the US. The DE .50 is several times more powerful and is one of the very few handgun rounds powerful enough to match a (low end) rifle bullet's performance. The reason why most handguns are much less powerful is to keep recoil manageable. Despite being absolutely huge for a handgun (mass reduces the felt effect of recoil), the DE .50 has a recoil that's beyond the ability of most people to manage and painful even then."
What was Hans Gruber's plan in Die Hard?,"Let's go through the plan of Hans Gruber without the interference from John McClane. (Source) Hans was, as it seems so, great at planning. He planned this to every detail. He knew that Takagi won't give him the password, but it really didn't matter because Theo was going to hack it anyway. They planned to call themselves terrorists so FBI can show up and cut the power which eventually open the last lock. He knew functioning of FBI and police. You can see that he identifies both FBI agents. It is unclear to me how Hans is planning to accomplish that.  It is not really explained in the movie, but it is not hard to assume. Hans was going to blow up the terrace with C4, so FBI and police get diverted and he can escape. He and his gang weren't going to show themselves to the police. They had planned escaping in the ambulance which Theo gets ready near the end. So, if they'd have blew up the terrace with hostages and didn't reveal themselves, everybody would assume that they also died in the blast. Without McClane causing a ruckus, it is likely that cops wouldn't have shown up to cut of the power and there would have been no uninvited guest who couldn't be identified afterwards. They were going to call the police anyway even if McClane doesn't show up. Also note that their plan wasn't altered that much even when McClane showed up. Things only went bad when McClane got their detonators and explosives."
Does Disney no longer produce hand-drawn cartoon films?,"In a 2013 interview with the Guardian, chief executive Bob Iger said that none of its animation companies are working in the traditional 2D format, and there are no current plans to do so again. Speaking at an annual shareholder's meeting in Phoenix, Arizona, on Wednesday, chief executive Bob Iger revealed that none of the studio's animation companies was working on 2D, hand-drawn material for the big screen. While Iger did not rule out returning in the future to the style which made the company famous, the long gestation period for Hollywood animated productions means a gap of several years before any new film might emerge. ""To my knowledge we're not developing a 2D or hand-drawn feature animated film right now,"" said Iger. ""There is a fair amount of activity going on in hand-drawn animation but it's largely for television at this point. We're not necessarily ruling out the possibility [of] a feature but there isn't any in development at the company at the moment."""
Why were movies shot on film shot at 24 frames per second?,"According to this site: In the early days of film cameras were hand cranked, which caused inconsistencies from movie to movie. Even further still, projection houses would speed up frame rates of movies to get that one extra projection at the end of the day. It wouldn’t be until 1929, with the introduction of the optical sound track, that the standard of 24 fps was established. The 24 frames per second standard was the smallest number that was easily divisible by 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 allowing editors to quickly find where to make their cuts; not to mention was the most cost effective. However, another site explains it this way: In this Home Theater Geeks podcast, host Scott Wilkinson talks with
  television historian Mark Schubin to find out why. The first
  “standard” framerate for filming movies was about 16 frames per
  second, although they didn’t measure it in frames per second back
  then. The 24fps framerate basically boils down to an off-the-cuff
  compromise, as Schubin explains. According to Schubin, movies weren’t initially measured in frames per
  second, but feet of film per minute. As an aside, this is where the
  term “footage” came from. 16fps came about because of the “60 feet per
  minute” standard. Filming was done at a rate of 60 feet per minute
  which provided around 16 frames of movie per second. While filming was done at 60 feet per minute, playback was often
  anywhere between about 80-100 feet per minute (about 20-28 frames per
  second). This was in order to speed up the film. It allowed the
  theatre to be able to play more movies per day, and get more paying
  customers through the door. When movies started to add sound, though, problems arose. The theatres
  were still able to play at pretty much any framerate they wanted to.
  But, 16fps movies sped up to 28fps would have actors sounding like
  Alvin and the Chipmunks. So, a new standard must be set. Schubin says that an engineer from Western Electric named Stanley
  Watkins went to meet with the Warner Brothers chief projectionist,
  Frank Rich. Watkins asked Rich, “What rate do people show movies at?”.
  The answer showed quite a range. The major first showings of movies typically played back at around 80
  feet per minute (around 21.5fps). The little theatres that wanted to
  get more shows in would play back anywhere up to 100 feet per minute
  (about 27fps). Watkins thought for a minute and said “Ok, let’s
  compromise on 90 [feet per minute]”. This second story seems to be supported by this blog post, which offers some more details: Anyway, someone decided it would be a great idea to add sound. How hard could it be? In fact, several companies tried to be the first to bring sound to the movies, hoping to capture the market. Funny thing is they all insisted on capturing at the same frame rate they displayed at. If you didn’t, the pitch would be all wrong and everybody would sound silly. And forget about music. Some picked 80 feet per minute (the already established speed for projection), some picked 85 feet per minute, and some picked 90 feet per minute. First one to get a working system was Warner Brothers Vitaphone. It was used in the 1927 “The Jazz Singer” which was the first feature length film with sync dialog and is considered the official start of the “Talkies.” The Vitaphone engineers had picked 90 feet per minute, or 24fps as their capture and projection speed. If one of the others had been first, we easily could be shooting 21.33fps or 22.66fp as a standard today. So sometimes you get lucky. [...] Movietone, which used technology that put the audio as an optical track on the film had many advantages, but it was a little late out of the gate. Because Vitaphone was first, the engineers of Movietone decided to match the Vitaphone frame rate."
Did Batman break his one rule?,"Batman has more than one rule, but the one line that he refuses to cross - the one thing that would turn him from a crusader into a villain - is that he does not kill. Only taking Christopher Nolan's Batman into consideration then yes, he did break this rule by directly causing the fall that accidentally killed Harvey Dent.  Let's look at the scene:  Batman is shot, Dent is safe, and the boy's fate is undecided, but Batman can't let a coin determine that fate. He lunges at Dent and the boy and all three go over the edge. Despite his armor, Batman is injured and not at full strength. He is only able to save the boy before he himself falls after Dent. Crashing through more debris than Dent (who was pushed far enough out that he was clear (and who may have survived had he not been in such a badly burned condition)) Batman gets more injured on the way down and lands near Dent.  Later on when talking to Gordon, Batman says: ""You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain. I can do those things, because I'm not a hero, like Dent. I killed those people. That's what I can be."" ----- ""I'm whatever Gotham needs me to be."" It's a great and powerful scene, but in its essence, it's one man (Batman) pushing another man (Dent) off a building and killing him (while saving an innocent boy), then taking the blame for not only Dent's death but the deaths caused by Dent as well. Batman is not just telling Gordon that he killed Dent, he is saying that he killed those people too. Batman feels directly responsible for their deaths and in Harvey's case, he is directly responsible.  This is the true genius of Nolan's Batman; he's not only real and plausible, he is constantly trying to figure out what he's doing, why is he doing it, and has he gone to far? Nolan made Batman break his most important rule. A lot of fans don't want to admit that Batman killed. An accidental killing doesn't count as breaking his rule they say, but to Batman it does count. It will haunt him. The deaths Two-Face caused will haunt him. He takes the blame for everything that happened. He pushed Two-Face off of a building and Two-Face died. The line has been crossed. How will Batman deal with that? How will he deal with being a criminal? The next movie will definitely deal with this but it is a huge step for Batman.  Nolan has created a realistic Batman. In Batman Begins we got to see what makes a man become a Batman. What training, what psychological problems, what Gotham's corruption had to do with it. When fighting Ra's al Ghul, we started to see a bending of the rule not to kill. Leaving Ra's al Ghul on the train was not killing in Batman's mind because Ra's al Ghul had survived a seemingly unsurvivable situation before, plus he had planned meticulously. If Batman could survive it, then he assumed Ra's al Ghul could as well.  At the start of The Dark Knight we start to encounter a basic problem with his rule: if Batman doesn't kill, why do criminals need to fear him? By the end of the movie Batman has killed and has taken the blame for more killings. This not only adds to the myth of the Batman but it directly affects his mental state. Throughout The Dark Knight we see him wrestling with how far he should push himself, what is his limit, what keeps him from being the Joker?  Then he breaks his most important rule and it seems to define him more. Did he plan to kill Two-Face? No. Did he directly cause his death? Yes! He did it in the only allowable way, to protect the innocent, and he did so by accident, but he still killed and still broke his rule.  Now we have a whole new Batman going into The Dark Knight Rises. One who has killed. One who has become a villain. Yet he is more sure of himself and what he stands for than ever before."
What is the origin of Scooby-Doo's name?,"Here is a video of Fred Silverman, CBS' head of daytime programming back in 1969, discussing the creation of Scooby-Doo. Starting at about 1:40, he describes hearing ""Strangers in the Night"" while on a plane and conceiving the Scooby-Doo name on the spot: On the plane, I couldn't sleep -- y'know, it was a Red-Eye, and I'm listening to music -- and as we're landing, as we're going in for the landing, Frank Sinatra comes on, and I hear him say ""Scooby-dooby-doo"", and it's at that point I said, ""Yeah, that's it! We'll take the dog, we'll call him Scooby-Doo, move him up front, and it'll be the dog show!"" So this is about as authoritative as you can get: Scooby-Doo's name was inspired by the Frank Sinatra song, and not the Kinks song. As you note in the question, and as others have noted in the comments, ""scooby-dooby-doo"" may not have been the actual lyric, but having been listening to it through tinny 1960s speakers, Silverman clearly misheard it.

"Was a supercomputer really needed in ""The Martian""?","The consensus on Space Exploration.SE where this same question was asked is... Answer by Mark Adler Well, developing low-thrust trajectories does take more computation than impulsive trajectories (e.g. like Voyager, which was done with rather primitive computers). You have no choice but to run many fully integrated trajectories. However it would not take a supercomputer of the future, or even a supercomputer of the present to search for and find trajectories like that. In fact, Andy Weir used his home computer (whatever that was, but likely not even a small cluster) to find and check his trajectories. Answer by DuffBeerBaron The short answer is no, the calculations do not require a supercomputer. Any modern laptop has the computing power to handle the scenario. The long answer is that the particular orbit depicted in the movie is what's called a Planetary Cycler, which cycles between two bodies (Earth/Mars). You can use gravity assists at each body to put your spacecraft on a return trajectory to the other body. These gravity assists can be augmented with maneuvers as needed. BUT YES Answer by Loren Pechtel Calculating an energy-optimal orbit for a simple thing like Earth->Mars is no big deal. Even using low-thrust engines doesn't add much to it. It would be tedious but you could do it on a calculator. However, that's not what they needed in the book & movie. The objective wasn't to get there as cheap as possible, the objective was to get there as fast as possible given the available energy. There's no standard solution for this, you're simply going to have to try a huge range of possible orbits and see what's best. That's why you want a supercomputer. Modern deep space craft often use paths that take some pretty extreme calculating. Consider Messenger: 6 planetary encounters and 5 deep space burns. They obviously simulated a huge number of possible paths to find the one that got them there the cheapest."
Why do people repeatedly hit the phone hook switch when disconnected?,"I believe that by 1970 (at least in most places), this behavior did not really accomplish anything very useful, but would have been more of a habit. However not too much earlier, operators would have been used extensively when completing calls.  Repeatedly pressing the hook would cause a light in the office to flash, directing the operator to pick up.  Since the operator might be able to assist with some types of dropped connections, the learned response to an unexpectedly dead line would be to call her in by cycling the hook.  "

What's the point of actors occasionally directing a TV show episode?,"Directors have, ultimately, artistic control over the final product.  While acting can be a satisfying endeavor, the true artistic vision of a story comes from a director.  There is also a degree of control over that final vision that no other role has.  Many of those involved in acting want to either take a turn at, or, ultimately become directors. Robert Redford and Clint Eastwood are actors who have achieved as much acclaim for their directing as their acting, and both them are considered huge just for their acting. Chris Evans, known for ""Captain America,"" doesn't even like the life of an actor/star, as much, and even though he's young and, probably, at his peak of star power and earning potential, he's publicly stated his intention to leave acting (for the most part), preferably to direct, instead.

Explanation of Jules' ending monologue,"This question has already an accepted answer, but I feel the need to answer anyway, because I have a very different point of view.  I'll use the same breakdown that phwd uses. See now I'm thinkin', maybe it means you're the evil man. And I'm the
  righteous man. And Mr. 9 Milimeter here, he's the shepherd protecting
  my righteous ass in the valley of darkness. The simplistic and egotistical version.  Ringo is trying to harm him, and can be classified as simply bad.  Jules is free to do whatever he wants. Or it could mean you're the righteous man and I'm the shepherd and
  it's the world that's evil and selfish.  Now, I'd like that.  But that shit ain't the truth. Assume that Ringo is a good man, and is forced to his path out of pure desperation in an unjust world.  Jules can protect and guide him, as he knows much of the world.  As Jules said, he would like that.  Jules would like to believe that he is a good person, and could help others with his new-found spirituality.   The truth is you're the weak. And I'm the tyranny of evil men.  But I'm trying.  I'm 
  trying real hard to be the shepard. Jules recognizes that Ringo isn't a truly bad person at the core: he doesn't want to hurt people (as mentioned in Ringo's speech), he loves his girlfriend, etc.  He is weak, and takes the easy way out by robbing people, but doesn't want to actually hurt people. But that's not the life that Jules has led.  He hasn't tried to avoid hurting people...he has killed many people and thought nothing of it.  Jules has come to realize that he has led the truly evil life.  But he wants to change.  He knows it won't be as easy as just saying it.  (""Now, I'd like that. But that shit ain't the truth."")  He has to live it.  And he starts by showing compassion, restraint, and mercy by not only letting Ringo live, but by letting him keep the money...giving him a lesson not of strength, but of generosity."
Why did Varys remove his rings?,"Removing valuable item was a sign of him knowing his coming fate. He knows that he will be executed now or we can say burned alive. From IGN When Varys heard a door open and the footsteps of soldiers approaching, that was the sign that his time had come to an end, so he decided to burn the letter he was writing to destroy the evidence of his plan and then prepare himself for death by removing his finery. Removing one’s valuables before imminent demise is a gesture we’ve seen in other stories before. It’s sort of a ritual of accepting one’s death, a way to prepare for what’s to come. The same article also covers fan theories too, one of the popular ones is the poison ring left for Tyrion or someone else to finish the job. Same poison theory is covered by gamespot too and go deeper: Zooming in on Varys's rings and brightening up the image doesn't reveal any conspicuous blue crystals. In fact, the ring we get the best look at seems to have represented Varys's loyalty to the Targaryen queen--it appears to be this ring from jewelry retailer Mey's official partnership with the show. The retailer calls it an ""allegiance ring,"" and their site claims that Varys, Tyrion, Jorah, and Grey Worm have all worn one since Season 7. It was designed to look like a dragon spine. In taking it off, Varys is symbolically shedding the symbol of his loyalty to Daenerys. But Varys is still loyal to Jon, who he now knows is also a Targaryen. Even though we didn't see the obvious blue poison crystal as Varys removed all his rings, the show seemed to focus on their removal just long enough that it might be important in the finale. After SO8E06:  poison ring theory has been debunked by the absence of that plot in later episodes so it seems it was only allegiance ring and he removed as he was going to die."

"In the ""300"" movie, in the final battle, Why didn't Leonidas kill Xerxes?","Because Leonidas and Xerxes were actual historical figures that have well documented histories. Xerxes lived through the battle.  Also The Battle of Thermopylae is a well-documented event. Taking artistic license, like having a spear graze Xerxes’ face is one thing.

In the context of the movie only: Leonidas did try to kill Xerxes, but it was a long, difficult throw. The (artistic) tragic part to this is that, if Leonidas had thrown a slight bit softer, the spear would have plunged a few inches lower, and the throw would have gotten Xerxes in the chest (and probably kill him). And so Leonidas dies having missed because he “tried too hard” to get distance on his throw. The following clip explains why Leonidas knelt (to shed his equipment in a passive manner) as preparation to make a difficult spear shot.

Why is Spaceballs specifically numbered Chapter XI?,"The only thing I can think of that is specifically related to the number 11 is possibly some kind of obscure joke about Chapter Eleven Bankruptcy. This might be a bit of a stretch, but it wouldn't be the first time a joke in a Mel Brook's movie seemed a little vague. Some evidence supporting this idea:  It also seems that others have made the same connection to this being a joke about bankruptcy: Opening on ""Chapter Eleven"" (a nice joke about bankruptcy), a familiar title crawl informs us that Planet Spaceball, led by President Skroob (Mel Brooks) has used up all of its air and plans to steal the air from the Planet Druidia, led by King Roland (Dick Van Patten). Another theory is that it is a joke playing on the confusion of audiences when The Empire Strikes Back opening crawl included the title ""Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"" while the original release of Episode IV did not include the episode number and was simply known as ""Star Wars"". IMDb's FAQ for Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope gives some insight on the history of this and the confusion of audiences: When the film was originally released in 1977, it was simply referred to as ""Star Wars""; though supposedly, George Lucas had intended to include ""Episode IV"" and ""A New Hope"" in the opening crawl, but Twentieth Century Fox did not want Lucas to do so because they thought it would confuse audiences, since there were never any other episodes released before it. After the commercial success of the original Star Wars, Lucas was able to continue with the multi-film epic he originally envisioned. The first sequel, The Empire Strikes Back, was released in 1980 and bore the full title of ""Star Wars, Episode V, The Empire Strikes Back"" in the title crawl, although it was referred to only as ""The Empire Strikes Back"" as the title of its commercial release. It was the ""Episode V"" appearing in the opening crawl which originally confused those members of the audience who had not been made aware of what Lucas was explaining, that the original Star Wars was now to be understood to be the fourth part of a nine-part series. The original Star Wars was re-released in 1981 with a new title ""Star Wars, Episode IV, A New Hope"" in the title crawl. This title appeared on all subsequent re-releases and versions from then on (though the original version was released on DVD in 2006, which shows the title crawl in its original form). All subsequent Star Wars films have followed this new naming structure, although ""Star Wars"" often refers specifically to the 1977 film.

Why does Scarecrow in The Wizard Of Oz get the Pythagorean Theorem wrong?,"There is a version of the script that had more to say to make it obvious that it was intentional, according to: Hollywood Science: The Next Generation, From Spaceships to Microchips (ISBN 331954215X, 9783319542157; Kevin R. Grazier, Stephen Cass; Springer, 2017) So I went back to the scripts I’ve got here, and we can specially credit Noel Langley with that part of the script. I’ve got a draft dated April 18, 1938 and these are changes to a script he already did. —perhaps the blend of chemistry with geometry in that manner was too obvious. That line does, however, remove much of the doubt that the Scarecrow’s faulty exposition on the nature of the isosceles triangle is intentional on the part of the writers, and it also makes it clear that, in essence, the Wizard did very little."
Why is James Bond less tech savvy in the Daniel Craig movies?,"I don't think it had any plot driven change.  The Bond franchise was feeling threatened by newer spy movies (such as the Bourne series) which have more action, (slightly) more plausible plots (compared to ray-gun satellites etc), and have less comedic elements. A reboot with a new younger actor and a deliberate step away from some of the conventions of the franchise (gadgets & moneypenny for example) were their answer. They tried to take  it this direction before - a Licence to Kill was a deliberate attempt with a drug-smuggling and revenge plot-line, but wasn't well done.  They then decided to switch back to more 'classic' Bond approaches with Brosnan."
Why doesn't Deadpool's healing ability heal his skin?,"Its the same as his comics counterpart: After the healing factor was given to him, it made his normal cells as

"How could Jon Snow do what he did in ""Oathbreaker""?","...it doesn't really matter what the rules would strictly say about Jon's status: Castle Black has just been, essentially, invaded by an army of wildlings and a giant. He's their chosen leader. It doesn't really matter if he orders the execution as Lord Commander or conqueror, the result is the same. The rules are as irrelevant at this moment as the fact King Robert wasn't the next in line to the throne when he put himself on it. Varys put it rather well: Power resides where men believe it resides Alliser could have protested against this, but chooses not to because he still sees Jon as the Lord Commander, and accepts his defeat. From a transcript: Alliser: I had a choice, Lord Commander. Betray you or betray the Night's Watch. You brought an army of wildlings into our lands. An army of murderers and raiders. If I had to do it all over knowing where I'd end up, I pray I'd make the right choice again. Jon: I'm sure you would, Ser Alliser.  Alliser: I fought, I lost. Now I rest. But you, Lord Snow, you'll be fighting their battles forever. Alliser is very absolute and black-and-white, not the type to quibble about interpretations. He'd probably rather hang than try to get off on a technicality. As head steward, Bowen Marsh (the first of the four) would be the most likely to raise a technical objection - but strict conformity to the rules is clearly not his focus at this moment: You... you shouldn't be alive. It's not right. He's a bit too distracted by the whole ""the man I murdered is back from the dead"" thing to worry about whether the man he murdered is, technically speaking, overstepping his authority. It'd take a ballsy lawyer to say ""You lost the authority to execute me when I murdered you!"". ...it's hard to say whether this would bother him. He's always been someone torn between doing what the rules or honour say (e.g. not joining Robb's army), bending honour to do what he thinks is right (e.g. trying to assassinate Mance during negotiations), and just doing what he wants to do (e.g. Ygritte).  But we've got reason to expect undead Jon to be colder and harder than he was before, based on what Beric said about his own returns from the dead back in season 3: Every time I come back, I'm a bit less. Pieces of you get chipped away. Also, in the books:  It seems like the longer someone is dead, the colder they come back. A certain lady who was dead a rather long time, who had been rather compassionate, comes back distinctly stone-hearted... Beric was never dead longer than minutes I believe, this lady was dead for days; it stands to reason Jon would be somewhere between the two. Jon was never entirely above bending the rules when it suited him, and a potentially vengeful undead Jon would seem to be even less likely to worry about such details.  The way he walks straight out with only the slimmest of attempts to justify himself... My watch is ended ...is a pretty good indication that he worries less about such details. As is one of the very first things he says after coming back: I did what I thought was right. And I got murdered for it. Regarding Jon's status at the Wall:  It's confirmed that there's disagreement and confusion about whether Jon is Lord Commander or not: a Brother delivers him a letter, addressing him as Lord Commander, and he hesitates, denies the title, but takes it anyway. There's also debate about whether his vows still apply. Regarding Jon 2.0's personality compared to the original model:  Based on his conversation with Sansa, he seems to be more lost than vengeful, compared to his old self: possibly less purposeful and driven, rather than more. It certainly seems like he came back ""a bit less"", but not in the cold, grim, hard and wrathful way I had suspected based on the analogous character from the books."
How was the deserted London scene in the movie '28 Days Later' filmed?,"Normally, movie producers would obtain permits to shut down roads around city filming locations. However, this is not usually permitted in London (even huge productions like Bond get very limited privileges in London), unlike a lot of America cities. Although, it seems that the producers were able to get some road closures, but under very limited conditions. To get around this, the empty London scenes were shot very early in the morning - sunrise in London is about 5am in the summer, and there is a long dusk before true sunrise which gives a decent amount of light. In fact, the dusk light (the golden light you see in some of the stills you posted) was probably used to provide an additional sense of eeriness to some scenes, along with some filtering/grading to reduce its effect in others. Before we started the main shoot we took a week in July, beginning each day at three or four every morning and would wait for the sun to come up We were able to shoot for an hour or so before the city got too busy for us to hold back the traffic. It was very exciting, and when you see the whole of Westminster Bridge and the embankment all closed for you, and the traffic stopped, and you can't hear anything, it was thrilling but strange as well. Source: 28 Days Later : About The Shoot A lot of the scenes are filmed in the inner cities of Westminster and London (the City of London itself is a square mile in the middle of Greater London), and these are mostly commercial and government offices - not a lot of residential areas - so there was not a huge number of people waking up and heading to work. However, even in the wee hours of the morning, Westminster and London and the surrounding areas are not completely empty. I think if you look carefully there is at least one brief shot of a moving bus in the distance. Mostly, the crew would reset and try for another shot if something like that happened. I remember reading around the time of the movie coming out, that a bigger problem were drunken revellers spilling out of nearby bars and clubs - the production crew hired a number of attractive young women to distract and guide people around the shoot."
Can someone explain the sequence of events in 'Primer'?,"Primer is a very complex movie and hard-to-impossible to understand in the first watching. This is due to the fact that we only see a small part of the actual happenings in the story, and the scenes are not in a chronologically correct order. This is hard to spot, as the scenes seem to fit after each other, but sometimes they are reruns of a scene that is replayed by time travelling older versions of the characters, thus resulting in strange behaviour or dialogues. One thing to look out for is the earpiece Aaron is wearing in some of the scenes. The Aaron from the future has recorded all earlier conversations, travelled back in time, replaced his earlier self and tries to recreate the dialogues this way, sometimes failing (e.g. in the basketball scene, where he misses the throw). So every time you see an earpiece, you know that this scene is not in chronological order. I would recommend reading this very good essay, studying the timeline posted in OddCore's answer, and then rewatching the movie once or twice. It helped me understand the movie to a point where I can more or less tell what is going on."
"Was the original ""Pink Panther"" movie intended to be a comedy?","From NNDB: Edwards' most famous work, The Pink Panther, was released in 1963, with Peter Sellers as Inspector Jacques Clouseau. The part had originally been cast with Peter Ustinov, but that actor reneged at the last minute, and Sellers stepped in, with his suggestion that the character be ""bumbling"", which, of course, changed not just the character, but the nature of film comedy. And from a Review by Clarenc Beaks: The Pink Panther (1963) began life as a star-studded caper comedy intended to be anchored by David Niven as the debonair jewel thief Sir Charles Lytton, aka ""The Phantom,"" a man audacious enough to carry on an affair with the wife of his tireless, if thoroughly inept, pursuer, Inspector Jacques Clouseau. And had Peter Ustinov, originally cast as Clouseau (and, coincidentally, batman to the higher-ranking Niven in World War II), not backed out of the production, following Ava Gardner's lead (who had been cast as Clouseau's philandering spouse), it's entirely possible that there would have been no Pink Panther franchise (though a great thespian, Ustinov was hardly anyone's idea of an explosive comedic talent). But when Peter Sellers came on board as the incompetent inspector, the picture was suddenly given a raucously funny performer who easily could run away with the proceedings. So it seems it was intended to be a comedy from the beginning, but quite a different style of comedy than what it became once Sellers got involved."
Why does Gus walk away from his car?,"From this source: ""Walt was right when he said that Gus is always 10 moves ahead. Gus didn't need to be right about his car being sabotaged; he was just smart enough to know that he was walking into what would be a perfect trap, and one he’d happily spring if the tables were turned. So he walked away."" Basically Gus wasn't sure if his car had been rigged to blow, but he knew if he was trying to kill someone it would have been a perfect way of achieving this. He is clearly very good at reading situations and this lead to him being so successful in such a dangerous industry."
Why were sloths chosen to depict DMV workers?,"One reason the scene works so well on repeated viewings is that it's essentially a sketch. The scene is just as funny on its own as it is within the context of the movie, and that's due to its brilliant concept.  Everyone who's ever been to the DMV knows how painful an experience it is. It takes forever, and to those forced to wait for hours, it seems as if the employees are being slow on purpose. Therefore, in a world populated by animals, the famously slow sloths would of course be the sole employees of the DMV.  Refer this for more info."
Why did Ramsay strike him?,"We can see the answer in what happens immediately after. It's textbook Ramsay manipulation, and it nearly worked. Ramsay was surrounded by loyalists to Jon's faction who immediately aimed at him. If he'd shot Jon, his men would have fired immediately without hesitation, killing him before rushing to try to save Jon. But Jon, their leader, is still alive, and Ramsay's talking, not posing an immediate physical threat - so they wait for Jon's order. This gives Ramsay an opportunity to do what he does best: manipulate honourable fools, and exploit emotional weaknesses.  He challenges Jon to a one-to-one fight, a challenge no sane person would ever accept in these circumstances - but Jon is easy to manipulate and enraged from just having seen a big friendly giant get shot in the eye. Jon charges, seemingly accepting the duel. Jon's men don't know what to do. This is duel, right? You don't interfere with duels.  If Ramsay had succeeded in shooting Jon here, Ramsay would get another opportunity to manipulate. He could confuse Jon's men's sense of honour using the fact they'd seen him beat Jon in a one-on-one duel that Jon had seemingly accepted. And a subtle detail: to my eye Ramsay seemed to be aiming at Jon's sword arm shoulder: had he hit, he could even make a show of being merciful to a disablingly wounded Jon, putting himself in a good negotiating position.  Could it work? Could he talk his way into exile, or possibly even divide what remains of Jon's ramsharkle army and turn the factions against each other (Wildlings and Night's Watchmen, Northerners and Vale knights)?  Maybe, maybe not - ill-disciplined leaderless men are unpredictable. But he'd have better odds this way than if he'd simply shot Jon then been immediately felled by a hail of arrows (and possibly, ripped in half by an angry wounded giant)."
Why is it so easy to become king of Wakanda?,"It's not THAT easy.  But the process is their tradition.  Remember, the ruler of Wakanda is also given the powers of the Black Panther and is expected to protect the country from outsiders etc - so combat skills are definitely a requirement. However, when a King dies, the King's first born takes over - much like in any monarchy.  The big difference here to most monarchies is that they invite open challenges from the tribes that make up Wakanda's people.  Each tribe has to nominate a challenger if they wish to challenge for the throne.  None of the tribes wishes to challenge T'Challa's claim except for M'Baku of the Jabari tribe. Killmonger has the ability to challenge for the throne because he is ""of royal blood"" - he's the son of T'Challa's uncle, who was King T'Chaka's brother.  If he wasn't of royal blood, then his challenge couldn't be accepted and would be deemed invalid. Conor McGregor couldn't take a shot at it as he's not Wakandan, so he couldn't be nominated by a tribe, and unless he could prove some royal connection to T'Challa, he's an invalid challenge as well."
How do they phrase casting calls when casting an individual with a particular skin color?,"You say what you need... that's it. I've worked in casting... for both speaking and non-speaking roles. The laws preventing hiring based on race/gender/etc don't apply to casting. If you need a crowd of black men as they would have for casting crowds in Selma, then you advertise that you're looking for black males with certain physical attributes (height/weight/age) and ask them to submit photographs and a resume. If ethnicity isn't important but you want to be certain to get a wide range, you can add something like ""all ethnicities are encouraged to submit""... but it's really not necessary. There are no in-system ""secret"" keywords because it's not necessary. You post calls for what you need. You will inevitably get submissions from people who don't fit your call but that's par for the course with any job posting. Some people will use color terms (black/white) and others will use ethnic-centric or regional terms (Hispanic/Caucasian/South Asian/Middle Eastern) and often you'll find the terms mixed together."
"What does the woman from the future mean when she says she's ""in insurance""?","She is ""insurance"" that the virus will successfully be spread around the world.  The key is that the scientists were never interested in stopping the virus in 1995. As Cole says early on, ""I just have to locate the virus in its original form before it mutates.  So scientists can come back and study it and find a cure.  So that those of us who survived can go back to the surface of the earth."" But later Cole decides to stay in 1995, and by the airport scene, he has given the future scientists the slip by cutting out his teeth. Except Cole leaves a message from the airport, leading the future scientists back to him -- with a two-part plan: Cole's message did not identify the virus spreader, so Jose's task at airport is to give Cole the gun and then watch who Cole goes after. When Catherine runs up and says she's figured out it is the redhead assistant to Dr Goynes who spreads the virus, Jose fades out of the scene, having got what he needed. (for confirmation see scene as written in production draft of script) From there, the scientists need to make sure Cole does not actually prevent the virus from being spread because that would dramatically disrupt the timeline. To prevent the disruption, the lady scientist is sent as back-up who -- if Cole somehow manages to stop redhead-ponytail guy -- can grab the briefcase, take the flights, and make sure the virus still gets spread around the world (which seems to end up being unnecessary because redhead-ponytail gets on plane OK) Luckily for the scientists, airport security shoots Cole when Cole tries to shoot the redhead guy. (The scientists may have provided Cole a non-working gun to encourage this outcome.) More evidence:"
How does one identify Valyrian steel?,"According to the Game of Thrones Wiki page about Valyrian steel: Valyrian steel is recognizable from its sharpness, as well as a distinctive rippled pattern visible in blades made from it While it's hard to detect sharpness from eyesight alone, the ""distinctive rippled pattern"" can be detected easily by those who know where to look for it. Couple of examples where it's easy to spot such patterns:  "
Was the Gotham Hospital scene a goof-up?,"Had a look at the special features on my Blu-ray of The Dark Knight (Special Features, Focus Points, Hospital Explosion), how the scene was planned and filmed is described in some detail. The scene was shot essentially as it appears, the only computer graphics used was the addition of two rows of glass windows at the top of the building. The delay between the two explosions was deliberate, this was to allow Heath Ledger to be much closer to the building.  The debris that you see flying around is actually pieces of soft cork, fired out of metal drums. The flying glass is stunt glass / breakaway glass, with each window shattered individually with its own charge.   The Focus Point doesn't explicitly say whether or not fiddling with the remote was Heath Ledger's idea. It does say: We rehearsed endlessly with Heath that morning. We walked him out, got him to do exactly what he was going to do, Chris Corbould [special effects supervisor] calling the explosions, where they would take place. We rehearsed it, I think, about twelve times. So if Heath Ledger did improvise with the remote, it sounds like he did it in rehearsal rather than on the spot with things exploding all around him."
Why were the villagers and the axe-wielding hitman brothers crawling towards a shrine?,"They are visiting a shrine of Santa Muerte (Saint Death). In Mexico, she is a popular folk saint/deity who is the patron saint of (among other things) drug dealers and smugglers, and is often invoked to protect against violent death. Traditionally, a worshiper would crawl on his knees on his way to visit the shrine."
What was wrong with John Rambo’s appearance?,"John explains it when talking to Trautman: Rambo: Nothing is over! Nothing! You just don't turn it off! It wasn't my war! You asked me, I didn't ask you! And I did what I had to do to win! But somebody wouldn't let us win! And I come back to the world and I see all those maggots at the airport, protesting me, spitting. Calling me baby killer and all kinds of vile crap! Who are they to protest me, huh? Who are they? Unless they've been me and been there and know what the hell they're yelling about!
Trautman: It was a bad time for everyone, Rambo. It's all in the past now.
Rambo: For you! For me civilian life is nothing! In the field we had a code of honor, you watch my back, I watch yours. Back here there's nothing!
Trautman: You're the last of an elite group, don't end it like this.
Rambo: Back there I could fly a gunship, I could drive a tank, I was in charge of million dollar equipment, back here I can't even hold a job parking cars! Rambo is not hiding that he is/was a soldier. Teasle is aware of the feelings people in his town might have toward the war and its participants, and he expects that this particular soldier is aware of it too. So he concludes that, by openly showing that he is/was a soldier, he is looking for confrontation of some kind. Edit: I've read somewhere a talk with David Morell, author of the book First Blood is based on. He said that in the world he's showing, and which, to his knowledge, existed, there are two kind of veterans of the Vietnam War. One that are aware of things they have done and are ashamed and hide the fact they were abroad. And one that are raised in this very American culture of being proud for serving your country because it can't be wrong. And this is what troubles Rambo. He has, what we would call, cognitive dissonance. He can't understand how people think his involvement was wrong and bad when he did what he did for his country AND for the citizens of his country. In his book Rambo dies as a sign that everything that was wrong with the Vietnam War and that what it did to people (US and Vietnamese alike) should die too."
Why do people call Morgan Freeman's character Red?,"Well, it is kinda explained on The Daily Beast, In the book, Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding was a ginger-haired, middle-aged Mick. Harrison Ford, Clint Eastwood and Paul Newman were all considered for the role that went to Morgan Freeman. Darabont alluded to the unusual casting choice by having Red jokingly reply to Andy’s inquiry about his nickname with the line, ""Maybe it's because I'm Irish."" Happily, they opted to not follow the quote with audio of a studio audience laughing. Anyway, it was derived from his actual surname of Ellis Boyd Redding, or 'Red' for short, as revealed in his first parole hearing in the film. Borrowed from comments: The physical characteristic of red hair is most common in the Irish. And for non-native speakers, ""ginger-haired"" means ""red-haired"". Credits to @G&C, ""red-haired"" is used to describe orange hair colours because orange is (relatively speaking) the newest colour name in the 7-colour spectrum (besides indigo), so the term ""red-hair"" literally precedes the use of ""orange"" as a colour."
"If Agent Smith is just an AI program, then how could he end up in the real world?","If you think our brain as just a CPU, and memory storage, you'd think of yourself as your memories + your thinking capacity. When you hack into the Matrix, you connect a jack to your head, and you basically send yourself inside the Matrix, where you are represented by an avatar of how you think you should look (without plugs, grown hair, etc), where yourself is reduced to code, very much like an AI (running in a human body). This self is tethered to the real body in the chair. If at any time you loose the connection (remove the head plug, or loose power on the ship) yourself in the Matrix dies.  In short, the plug translates the brain thoughts and memories to Matrix code, and translates Matrix code back to the brain. Agent Smith infects Bane's avatar in the Matrix. While his virtual representation changes to that of Agent Smith, it's still very much Bane's Body and mind running ""Bane's avatar"" on the Matrix. When Bane wakes up in real life, his mind is infected with Agent's Smith. Agent Smith's code was translated into thoughts and memories on Bane's brain."
Does Mia mistake Vincent's heroin for cocaine because it's in a baggie rather than a balloon?,"Yes, what Vince buys is absolutely heroin.  Yes, Mia absolutely believes what Vince has is cocaine. But wait.  Do they really look the same?  I thought heroin was brown (as in, ""Mr. Brownstone"", the Guns And Roses classic), and coke was white? Well, low-grade heroin (from the Middle East) is brown.  It'as ideal for smoking because it's not very soluble and burns at a lower temperature. High-grade heroin (from the Far East) is white.  Much more pure.  Ideal for injecting or snorting.  Yes, you can snort heroin.  In small amounts. Vince, if you recall, asked for the high-grade stuff.  Unless you have specific tools at your disposal (like a microscope or a burner), it's very difficult to tell high-grade heroin and cocaine apart.  So, usually, you put heroin in a balloon and coke in a bag.  Most drug users will know the distinction.  However, if it's not your stash it's always best to ask or do a small taste test, because they have distinctive tastes.  Mia, likely, just saw the bag and assumed it was coke."
How do actors avoid looking into the camera?,"It's only difficult to not look into the camera for you because you're not used to being around them. If someone's taking a photo or video of you, you're ""trained"" to look at the camera because it's generally a portrait-style shot. Actors are trained to not look at the camera. Looking at the camera is called ""spiking the camera"" and it means that you've just ruined a shot and you have to start over... congrats, you just cost the company money. As the TV Tropes article points out, editors don't always catch these, so you may see them in films and TV: A specific form of Breaking the Fourth Wall accomplished merely by looking directly at the camera. Usually done by accident, by amateur actors who happen to notice a camera is pointed at them. The trouble here is that the editor didn't catch it, allowing the character to make eye contact with the audience. Typically a film or live TV trope, especially in dramas.  Trust me, even for new extras, you've had ""don't look at the camera"" so drummed into your head from the second you set foot on set, it's running non-stop through your mind that it's the only thing you're thinking about. On set, directors will give actors a specific eye-line for where to look. Usually they're looking at another actor... the person they're doing the scene with. This is beneficial for performance reasons. If the person they're acting opposite isn't available due to scheduling or they're in  makeup, or something else, they often have someone else there to deliver lines and act as eye line. Sometimes they're looking at a thing off in the distance... building, animal, ocean... whatever. Sometimes they're looking at a piece of colorful tape that's stuck to part of the camera or other piece of equipment (this is generally used when the talent is almost looking at camera)... And, in CG films, they're probably looking at a colorful tennis ball on a stick being controlled by someone off camera.  And, finally... and probably most importantly...  if you're good at acting, you're so involved in what you're doing that everything other than the person/people you're acting opposite simply fade away into the background. If you're doing it right, the cameras, director, lights... everything else... it just goes away and it's just you and that other person having a conversation or fighting a monster or  watching TV...

Meaning of the Silence of the Lambs poster,"This award-winning poster art conveys many of the movie's themes and plot points: Clarice's skin is pale (in stark contrast to the darkness surrounding her) and blue like a corpse while her blue eyes had turned red, representing the film's themes of death, danger and virtue confronted with a malvolent influence (Lecter's eyes are red in the books, and another poster featuring his face employed a similar color scheme). The moth with the skull pattern is a death's-head hawkmoth that's found in one of the bodies. Buffalo Bill inserts a moth's cocoon to the mouth of one of his female victims. Moths represent change in the movie, and other than explicitly representing Buffalo Bill's desire to change, it could certainly be argued that Clarice also transforms during the investigation. The skull on the moth actually replicates In Voluptas Mors [Warning: Nudity], a photo conceived by Salvador Dali of seven naked women[*] that form a skull. This not only suggests the lewd nature of the crimes seen in the movie, which involve female bodies, but also the complexity involved (Lecter is an extremely cultured man and a skilled painter). The moth also covers Clarice's mouth to allude to that titular Silence she so desperately needs. [*] [As a point of interest: Before the plot starts in both book and movie, Buffalo Bill as a serial killer (since he's responsible for other, unrelated murders) had already kidnapped 5 women, skinned them and dumped their naked bodies in rivers. Later on, Starling would attend the autopsy of his 6th victim, and eventually save Catherine - which would've been Bill's 7th victim.]"
What is the main theme of The Dark Knight?,"The Dark Knight, in my view, is an epic description of the Joker's character. There is no other theme to the movie. Just as 'Batman Begins' was centered mainly around the characterization of the Batman. I observed a similarity and a difference between the Joker and the other mob bosses/bad guys. The similarity is that, both the bad guys and Joker have anti-social ideas. The difference lies in what level of sophistication the players employ. The other guys want to kill Batman and prey on the fearful. Joker is different. He just wants to kill everyone else. He also wants to prove that everyone is inherently un-altruistic / sadistic. That is why he conducts the experiment on the ferry with the prisoners and the convicts. This is classic prisoners' dilemma. He also succeeds in employing Harvey Dent, the supposed hope of Gotham City, the only DA brave enough to prosecute Gotham's criminals, and turn him against Gotham. These are a battery of experiments that he performs - just for the thrill of finding out what happens."
"How did Hitchcock enforce the ""no late admission"" policy for Psycho?","Although the movie studios had considerable sway and influence over theatre owners at the time they could not insist that the owners maintain the policy of ""no late admission"". It's possible that they could have included a clause into the contracts to this effect but it seems that the studio went for persuasion instead. What happened was the the studio created a ""policy"" of ""no late admission"" and demonstrated to the theatre owners that the policy was good for business. There was heavy marketing of the director's ""requirement"" that viewers watched the whole film from the beginning. The studio created a ""movie"" as part of their press pack which was given to theatre owners to promote the policy. It can be found on YouTube. 

 There were ""preview / demonstration"" showings... Showings of the film began on a tightly-controlled schedule in theatres in New York, Chicago, Boston, and Philadelphia. And a firm ""no late admission"" policy was put in place. You either saw the film from the very beginning, or you didn't see it all. Signs appeared in front of cinemas reading: ""We won't allow you to cheat yourself. You must see PSYCHO from the very beginning. Therefore, do not expect to be admitted into the theatre after the start of each performance of the picture. We say no one -- and we mean no one -- not even the manager's brother, the President of the United States, or the Queen of England (God bless her)!"" source All in all, it seems that by convincing the theater owners that the policy would actually increase revenue they persuaded them to ""enforce"" the rule as it was to everyone's benefit.

"Why does Deadpool say ""You're welcome, Canada,"" after shooting Ryan Reynolds in the end credits?","Ryan Reynolds has repeatedly said that he is less than happy with his appearance in the 2011 ""Green Lantern"" movie - he even admits that he has never seen it. Ryan Reynolds provided this explanation to EW, highlighting how although there were a lot of people working hard to make Green Lantern successful, Warner Bros was more concerned with releasing the movie rather than making sure the script was perfected before starting. That meant there was never an opportunity to nail down what the movie's tone was supposed to be, making the final product feel generic So Deadpool, by killing Ryan Reynolds (a Canadian born in Vancouver) before he accepted his role in the Green Lantern, saved the whole country from the embarrassment of a Canadian actor in the movie."
Why is the swordfight in The Princess Bride so good?,"Cary Elwes's As You Wish: Inconceivable Tales from the Making of The Princess Bride gives a lot of detail about why the sword fight turned out so well.  Neither Elwes nor Mandy Patinkin had a sword-fighting background. But they worked with excellent trainers: Peter Diamond was a good three decades into what is generally regarded as one of the most legendary careers of any stuntman or stunt coordinator in both television and film. As a sword-trainer he had worked with both Errol Flynn and Burt Lancaster. And in the previous decade alone, he had served as stunt coordinator on the original Star Wars trilogy. For you “Wookieepedias” reading this, the Tusken Raider that surprises young Luke Skywalker on the Tatooine cliff top with that horrifying scream? That was Peter. He had also been the stunt arranger and coordinator on movies like From Russia With Love, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and Highlander. Classically trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, Peter had also appeared in front of the camera, not only as a stuntman but sometimes as an actor as well. That’s him as the German soldier Indy notices in his side mirror climbing along the side of the eighty-mile-an-hour speeding truck without a harness in Raiders. Peter logged more than a thousand credits before passing away in 2004, at the age of seventy-five. He was vibrant and actively employed until the last year of his life. Bob Anderson was also a native of England and also something of a national hero, having served in the Royal Marines during World War II and as a representative of Great Britain on the fencing team in the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki. He later became president of the British Academy of Fencing and a coach for the British national team. His expertise as a swordsman eventually took him to Hollywood, where he became a sought-after stuntman and fight coordinator. The man’s résumé was breathtaking, from coaching Errol Flynn like Peter in the 1950s to choreographing fight scenes for several James Bond films in the 1960s, and working alongside Peter in From Russia With Love and (Star Warrior alert) on the Star Wars trilogy. That is Bob using the dark side of the Force as Vader in all the light-saber sequences. Bob also passed away, in 2012, at the age of ninety, but worked until the last, serving as “sword master” for Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings trilogy. Elwes, Cary; Layden, Joe. As You Wish: Inconceivable Tales from the Making of The Princess Bride (Kindle Locations 927-942). Touchstone. Kindle Edition. He gives a sidebar to Mandy Patinkin, who talks about the training he did even before he and Elwes began rehearsing together: Goldman wrote in the introduction to my character that he is “the world’s greatest sword fighter,” and I figured, that’s what I’ve got to learn how to do. So I immediately got in touch with Henry Harutunian, who was the Yale fencing coach, and we worked together for two months. He taught me the basics of fencing. I was a righty, and he taught me first how to fence with my left hand; we worked the left before the right, and I actually became a better left-handed fencer than a right-handed fencer. Elwes, Cary; Layden, Joe. As You Wish: Inconceivable Tales from the Making of The Princess Bride (Kindle Locations 948-951). Touchstone. Kindle Edition. They started out practicing forty hours a week, and in pretty much any spare moments during the production, they were practicing. So the answer is: Rob Reiner hired the best in the business to train Patinkin and Elwes, and they put in a lot of time learning the techniques."
How does a rifle fire backwards?,"While I am not a gun expert, it would be safe to say that while normal rifle cannot be modified to shoot bullet backward, it is possible to modify the rifle to make it hurt the shooter. All you'd need is an obstructed barrel and powerful enough bullet:  This is the photo from a real life accident - the shooter wasn't killed but seriously wounded."
What is Mycroft's job?,"His official position is never stated, either in the TV series or the canon Doyle stories. Essentially, in the TV series, he is a troubleshooter for the British establishment granted (or assuming) great powers and abilities. In line with the the Doyle stories, he is referred to by Sherlock as follows: ""He is the British Government – when he's not too busy being the British Secret Service or the CIA on a freelance basis."" A Study in Pink This is very similar to the Doyle description... ""Practically he is the British government [...] the most indispensable man in the country."" He apparently serves as a sort of human computer, as stated in ""The Bruce-Partington Plans"": He has the tidiest and most orderly brain, with the greatest capacity for storing facts, of any man living. The same great powers which I have turned to the detection of crime he has used for this particular business. The conclusions of every department are passed to him, and he is the central exchange, the clearinghouse, which makes out the balance. All other men are specialists, but his specialism is omniscience. We will suppose that a minister needs information as to a point which involves the Navy, India, Canada and the bimetallic question; he could get his separate advices from various departments upon each, but only Mycroft can focus them all, and say offhand how each factor would affect the other. They began by using him as a short-cut, a convenience; now he has made himself an essential. In that great brain of his everything is pigeon-holed and can be handed out in an instant.

Hollywood movies that no longer exist in any form,"Oh good lord, yes. List of lost films (Wikipedia) The Scorsese Film Foundation estimates that more than 90% of American films made before 1929 are totally lost. The Library of Congress estimates that 75% of all silent films are lost. Overall, 50% of American sound films made before 1950 are considered lost films. (film preservation) Films may go missing for a variety of reasons. The big culprit is the use of nitrate film until the early 1950s. Nitrate films are highly flammable, and will decay into a powder or sticky goo that can spontaneously combust in the storage-shed conditions they were commonly stored. A fire destroyed the entire vault of pre-1935 negatives at Fox Pictures, and a fire in 1967 decimated MGM's early content. Kodak introduced a nonflammable film in 1909, but chemicals used to keep it pliable evaporated too quickly, making the film dry and brittle. Until the preservationist movement fully kicked in, as much as half the 400,000 short sponsored films made in the US were lost, often thought of as simply disposable, or older versions were disposed of once upgraded. These are typically films made for educational, training, or religious purposes that were popular from the '40s through the 1970s. Many silent films were also simply discarded as ""useless"" once talkies took over entirely. Most mainstream movies from the 1950s through today survive due to increased preservation efforts and more stable media, but even today films are lost. Some of Jackie Chan's and Sammo Hung's first roles, including Big and Little Wong Tin Bar, have been considered lost. Ed Wood's 1972 film, The Undergraduate, has been lost along with his 1970 film, Take It Out In Trade, which exists only in fragments without sound. Most of Andy Milligan's early films made between 1965 and 1988 are considered lost. Many adult films and low-budget B-Movies go unnoticed until the participants become notable, then many of their early works are simply gone. Lost films are anything in which no part of a print is known to have survived. That does not include the much larger category of incomplete films where only bits and pieces remain."
Do the actors really go nude in the shooting of the movies?,"That's really up to the actor (if they have enough clout).  Very often it is written into contracts whether an actor will go fully or partially nude, regardless of whether their on screen character does so. During filming it is not unknown for filmmakers to use body doubles for close up shots, and many times during mid to long shots an actor might request to wear skin tone pieces which cover their genitals or nipples. *As an example - here is Megan Fox (who will not do fully nude roles) wearing flesh-colored nipple covers and 'briefs' for a supposedly nude swimming shot in the film Jennifer's Body.* "
Why does Batman talk to himself in the batvoice?,"Despite frequently being ridiculed, according to the (now made unavailable) production notes for Batman Begins; Wayne is incapable of speaking without the Bat-voice when he is wearing his Cowl. According to original drafts for the film: ""High-gain stereo microphones are concealed in the ears, allowing Batman to eavesdrop on distant conversations,"" the notes describe. The mikes can also amplify Batman's voice and broadcast it through a discreet speaker in the suit, giving his voice that distinctively gruff, disembodied sound. While the original script included a scene that went over these
  Bat-details, mentions of Batman's embedded vocal distorter wound up
  being cut from the final film. (Still, the Batsuit's tiny speakers
  remained visible upon close inspection.)  In discussing how he realized the mindset of Batman, Bale notes that his Batvoice contributed to him winning the role: ""I got there. They put me in Val Kilmer's suit. It didn't even fit properly, and I stood in it and I went 'I feel like an idiot.' What kind of guy walks around, dressed like a bat? And is then going to go 'Hello, how are you? Just ignore that I'm dressed as a bat.' Of course, he's meant to be doing this. If you look at the history of the guy and the pain that he went through. I went 'I can't do this in a normal voice. I have to become a beast in order to sell this to myself.'"" Whilst he isn't exactly 'going method' for the role of Batman, Bale indicates that for the character of Wayne, putting on the Batsuit is assuming a certain persona, as opposed to merely wearing a disguise. In order to sustain the mindset of 'the beast', its plausible that when he dons the suit he becomes Batman, and this is a psychological state of which he is unwilling or unable to simply 'switch off', voice included.  Update: 'The microphone built into the suit' aspect of Batman's voice has since been validated by it's onscreen inclusion in Batman Vs Superman: Dawn of Justice"
"Why was Bruce's silence referred to as a ""Walt Disney""?","Is there a reference I'm not getting? i know Walt Disney pioneered sound cartoons, so is it meant to be ironic? At one point in time, it was rumored that Walt Disney had been cryogenically  frozen upon his death, so that he could be reanimated in the future. This, however, did not happen.. In 1972, Bob Nelson, who was at that time the president of the California Cryogenics Society, is quoted saying the following: ""Walt Disney wanted to be frozen. Lots of people think that he was, and that the body's in cold storage in his basement. The truth is, Walt missed out. He never specified it in writing, and when he died the family didn't go for it. They had him cremated. I personally have seen his ashes. They're in Forest Lawn. Two weeks later we froze the first man. If Disney had been the first it would have made headlines around the world and been a real shot in the arm for cryonics. But that's the way it goes."" source To provide a bit more dialogue from Bruce Almighty which further supports this: DIRECTOR: We've got a Walt Disney. CONSOLE OPERATOR: Frozen solid."
Why wasn't the poltergeist Peeves in the Harry Potter movies?,"They filmed some scenes with Peeves in the first film, but he was cut before the film was released. The character wasn’t revived for the later films. I found a few interviews that touch on the topic of Peeves. First, there was an interview with BBC Norfolk with Chris Rankin, who played Percy Weasley, where he explains that they actually shot scenes with Peeves, but they were cut from the film: What's the longest time you've ever spent shooting a scene? The longest scene I've ever shot was on this first film. It was the scene with Peeves the Poltergeist. We shot it in Gloucester Cathedral cloisters. Sadly it never made it to the final take although I hear Chris Columbus is going to be making a director's cut in which it will be reinstated. This would have been Philosopher’s Stone, and he was played by Rik Mayall. I’m not aware of that director’s cut being released, or any of that footage being widely available. So why were those scenes cut? There’s an interview with Chris Columbus, who directed the first two films, which makes it sound as if it was just Apart from casting, what was the biggest challenge putting the film together? Was it the sheer scope of the thing? […] I loved the book so much that it was extremely difficult to cut elements out. One of my favourite characters never made the film – Peeves, the annoying, sort of, mischievous poltergeist. Those sorts of things, there was just too much to film. Our first cut of the film was about 3 hours and 20 minutes. As other posters have said, Peeves didn’t play a particularly prominent role in the books: although he gets a few lines, he’s not critical to any plot points. If they were trying to shed material, you can see why Peeves would be one of the characters who gets cut. Alternatively, there’s also an interview with Steve Kloves, who wrote all but one of the films, who offers his take on why Peeves was dropped in the final cut: On a different note, what about some characters in the books who never appeared on screen? What ever happened to Peeves? Peeves was always an issue. Chris Columbus was determined to put him in the first movie. I think there were even some technological problems with him initially, and [not] being satisfied with how he looked. He was always a bit tangential. I think [Argus] Filch, in a way, became that energy in the movies. And he was actually sort of beloved at a certain point, Filch. So I think to have Peeves, it would have felt like we were doubling up on that. It's not exactly the same but it's a bit like that. But he was a character we all loved."
How was the DeLorean perceived in 1985?,"In regards to the movie: So how was Doc Brown's reveal of a DeLorean perceived by 1985 audiences? Was it seen as a joke? An eccentricity of Doc Brown? A symbol of luxury or frivolity or stupidity? The DeLorean fits with Doc Brown, thematically speaking. Everything you say about the car: Notorious for poor quality, being badly made, and a huge expensive flop applies to Emmett Brown as well, barring the success of the time machine which is irrelevant as he would obviously already have bought the car by then. Much as the DeLorean was a ridiculed failed futuristic car built by a now-disgraced designer, Doc Emmett Brown was a disgraced nuclear physicist and perceived to be mad as a coot. He spent his family fortune on his failed inventions, losing tons of money in the process (there's the reasonable fan theory that he burned his own manor to collect insurance. The fire is mentioned in a newspaper article in the movie). It's not that surprising based on his general demeanor, but people dismissed him as a crazy old man. It's very fitting for Doc to choose this car which (like its creator) had spectacularly failed and was the laughing stock of those who knew it. This is a fairly common trope: a character chooses the option that describes themselves well. When buying a pet, a social outcast will pick a lonely animal. When buying a car, the crazy failed inventor picks a crazy failed car. It's an easy way to provide both exposition (if the character isn't well known yet) and thematic congruence (if the audience already knows that both are similar). Breaking Bad is a great second example here. Walt's car, much like himself, is a boring and bland car, and even though it's perfectly capable and has no glaring issues, it just completely failed to take off in the modern market, underselling even relative to cars with less features and worse reviews. Sound familiar? I suspect you know most of this already, but I'm adding it because the conclusion relies on it. In regards to the car itself: did the first BTTF change the perception of the DeLorean? Sadly, DMC had already gone out of business by then. On top of that, a cocaine scandal left the DeLorean's creator (and thus legacy of the DeLorean itself) heavily tainted. On October 19, 1982, the same day DeLorean's factory was announced to be closed, the man behind the car was arrested in a cocaine trafficking bust. He had been set up by his neighbor, an FBI informant, and was caught at an LA hotel saying ""it's better than gold"" after being given a large case of cocaine by the undercover FBI agents. He was acquitted in August 1984, successfully claiming governmental entrapment, but the damage to his reputation and finances had been done. There were no more cars to sell, so there wasn't much to gain for the movie. However, there is some silver lining here: Thanks to the film, the DeLorean was elevated to icon-status, with licensing for toy cars reportedly paying DeLorean's bills. In conclusion: So it would be fair to separate the conclusion in two parts: the car itself had already irreversibly failed, but it found a second life as a pop movie icon, and it still is to this day. Due to the similarities between Doc Emmett Brown and the DeLorean (as perceived in 1984), the car fit with the movie thematically, both in reputation (for Doc's character) and looks (for a sci-fi movie). You can argue that for most people, the real car and the movie icon had little to no overlap for them."
At what point is the orchestra told who the Academy Award winner will be?,"When everyone else does - when the winners are announced. I can't find an answer originating directly from the Academy on this, but Time covers the 2014 Oscars and had an article which stated: • A small team of people (about six people, not including Rosas and
Cullinan) split up the ballots so that nobody is counting an entire
category, which means nobody knows how the different entries stack up.
Those subtotals are added up by Rosas and Cullinan [two accountants]. By Friday evening,
the two accountants will know all the winners. • Though they won’t
disclose how many vote are received, there are about 6,000 voting
members of the Academy. All of the counting is done by hand. “It’s
old-school,” says Cullinan. “It’s as boring as it sounds. You have
lots and lots of stacks of little pieces of paper.” • All of the
categories are counted several times, and extra if there’s a tie
(which has happened). There has never been a post-awards recount
required. • The Academy provides triplicates of cards listing each
movie in every category. Rosas and Cullinan put the winning cards in
the envelopes; the losing cards and extras are destroyed. • Two
identical and complete sets of cards are put in two identical
briefcases. This year, PwC has introduced a new style of briefcase —
seen above — which is the first one to bear the Academy’s logo as well
as the accounting firm’s. • Having rehearsed their blocking on
Saturday, Rosas and Cullinan will travel to the show separately, in
cars with security details. They carry the briefcases down the red
carpet, pausing for interviews, and each take their places on opposite
sides of the stage. As presenters come on from either side, they’ll be
handed the right cards. This process is backed up in several other places, including the Journal of Accountancy: Secrecy is paramount. Team members from PwC meet at an undisclosed
location, and each accountant tabulates only a portion of the votes so
he or she won’t know the final results. Only Ruiz and Cullinan put
everything together in the end to determine who the Oscar winners are,
and they commit those results to memory. The winners’ names are not
typed into a computer or written down, to avoid potential lost slips
of paper or breaches of security. In the final hours before the Oscars
ceremony, Ruiz and Cullinan will quiz each other to make sure they
have accurately memorized the winners in each category. They then will
look through the preprinted cards for all of the nominees, select
those that list each of the victors, and stuff the envelopes. Both
will head to the ceremony on Sunday carrying the correct set of
envelopes. If one gets hung up in L.A. traffic, the other will also
have the results in his or her briefcase. Once at the event, both will
be backstage to hand the appropriate envelopes to the celebrity
presenters during the live event. So inferring from what both of these articles say, the orchestra find out when most of the world finds out - when the winner is announced. This means they will likely have rehearsed multiple pieces of music for each winner. As @sanpaco says in his comment above, this is certainly not uncommon for a highly professional musical outfit."
Why does Westley say Rodents of Unusual Size don't exist?,"He says this to keep the Princess calm and moving forward -- which is their best chance of surviving. He is concerned she might do something irrational like go back or take off in some random direction. He knows that just maybe they will be left alone, and his ploy will succeed. If not, then he has no control over it anyway, and will have to deal with it at that time.  He has also grown into his role as the Dread Pirate. He pulls that role off because it suits him naturally. What would the pirate do? He would down play it and essentially write if off as something to not be concerned about. Also, it makes for good comedy. He says they don't exist, and then he is wrestling with one of them. I remember heartily laughing at this one."
Why did Dormammu keep his promise?,"If he didn't keep his promise, it's a matter of time Dr. Strange will again bind him in the loop. Remember Strange still has the Time Stone. Dormammu was exhausted so he couldn't risk to get in the time loop again. In the time loop, he wasn't able to figure it out how he kept coming back after dying so many times. So, it wasn't wise to break the promise until he finds a way to break Strange's magic."
"In Back to the Future, how did Marty get the timing right with the lightning strike?","We know that the timer went off several seconds before Marty floored the accelerator. We know that Marty quite literally hooked the line at precisely the correct time. Therefore the only valid conclusion is that Marty accelerated faster than Doc calculated/anticipated/intended. Thus there are only two valid explanations: (1) Doc planned for Marty to accelerate at a rate less than the car's maximum acceleration. This leads to the obvious question: How would Marty know how fast to accelerate? We can suppose that he did some test runs off screen, or we can attribute it to movie magic (""he eyeballed it!""). (2) Doc miscalculated the maximum acceleration of the car. Although a genius, perhaps there were aspects of the car that he had no way of determining in advance. Or maybe there was less fuel in the tank (less mass to push) or better road traction than he anticipated (although the roads seemed pretty slick, IMO). Either way, if he did make a mistake and the timer was set to assume maximum acceleration, then Marty was very lucky. There is a third option (Marty was always supposed to wait X number of seconds after the timer went off), but that isn't directly supported by anything canonical in the movie. Other thoughts: The flexibility of the hooking mechanism or any other such variance in exactly when Marty hit the cable is negligible. He clearly left the starting line many seconds late. Any question about whether the flexibility of the hooking mechanism impacted his arrival time would only have an impact on the order of milliseconds and may thus be discounted for the purpose of this question. The speed of the lightning through the cable is obviously shown to be quite slow for visual impact in the movie. Obviously in real life it would have traveled faster than that. In any event, Doc would have been able to calculate the speed of the lightning through the conductor, so let's assume he was accurate there. Unfortunately any discussion surround whether the lighting struck at ""precisely"" 10:04:00 or sometime between 10:04:01 and 10:04:59 is a red herring. The fact is that the movie depicts the lightning as striking immediately after the minute hand moves to 10:04. It's not made clear in the movie how 1955 Doc knows that it will be ""precisely"" 10:04:00. (My guess: clock engineers in the intervening years investigated the clock, observed that it was ""precisely"" 10:04:00, and then documented that fact in the flyer that Marty received. But exactly how that information came to Doc is beyond the scope of the question the OP asked.) Regardless, 1955 Doc is correct -- lightning did strike at precisely that time."
Why does James Bond keep demanding a vodka martini that is shaken but not stirred?,"There are several reasons why Bond would order his drink 'shaken, not stirred'. Firstly, he might prefer a colder drink, as shaking a martini will certainly result in a colder beverage. However, this causes the drink to lose its clarity due to the tiny ice chips and is often frowned upon by 'connoisseurs' who claim this 'bruises' the gin. Secondly, it is recorded that Ian Fleming was a fan of of shaken martinis - particularly ones made by Gilberto Preti, a bartender in Dukes Hotel, London. If you are looking for a scientific reason, then it is claimed that a shaken martini results in a drink with marginally more antioxidants in it - which must make it a bit healthier :)
There are a few more reasons cited in this interesting article from the Royal Society of Chemistry, including the breakdown of the oils found in cheaper vodkas from Bond's era."
Did they torture and kill a monkey during the filming of Andromeda Strain?,"Torture is a strong word but it could easily be described as mistreating the creature but it does seem to have been done under the supervision of the ASPCA. In fact...from IMDB apparently from the Robert Wise documentary on the making of the movie The monkey was ""killed"" by being placed in a large set filled with carbon dioxide. When the monkey's cage, which contained oxygen, was opened the animal was rendered unconscious by the CO2. An assistant director was off camera and brought a breathing apparatus to the monkey, who recovered immediately. but A few additional details about the controversial death scene of the monkey in the laboratory:"
Did 007 exist before James Bond?,"According to the wiki, Bond is the only 007 in Ian Fleming's Bond stories: James Bond is the only agent 007. In the novel You Only Live Twice, Bond was transferred into another branch and given the number 7777, suggesting there was no active agent 007 in that time; he is later reinstated as 007 in the novel The Man with the Golden Gun. But the Bond stories from Anthony Horowitz's novel, he takes it from another agent: In Anthony Horowitz's continuation novel, set before the events of Casino Royale, an unnamed agent 007 is murdered, which leads to James Bond taking over the code-number in Forever and A Day, thus marking his first ever assignment as a 00-agent. It's never explicitly said in the movies, but the first Eon Production Films 007 movie was Dr. No (1962) which is an adaptation of Ian Fleming's novel, so we can safely assume that the movies have the same backstory as the novels."
Why was Being John Malkovich based around John Malkovich?,"Charlie Kaufman explains it in an (video) interview with Charlie Rose (skip to 21:00): I don't know... I thought it was funny. It's hard to explain, but I
  thought it was funny, but not jokey. Because [John Malkovich] is a serious actor, he
  is a great actor, but there is something odd about him and there is
  something behind his eyes that you can't see. And I thought that was a
  good person for this. And then I think his name is perfect for the title... when we trying to get the movie made... we didn't know if John was going to do it and Spike [Jonze] and I sort of tried to make a list of other possibilities and there are lots of good actors but nobodys name sounded good in the title... so... it was important for that reason. As John Malkovich explains in this (video) interview, even though he liked the script from the start, he asked Kaufman  if he would make that movie about someone else, that I would like to direct it and we would produce it. Only several years after that the movie finally got made. This is also mentioned on the IMDb trivia page: John Malkovich was approached about this film several times and loved the script, but he and his production crew felt that another actor would fit the role better.  Malkovich offered to help produce the film, and aid Spike Jonze in any way, but refused to star in it.  Eventually after a couple of years Malkovich's will was worn down and he agreed to star in the film."
When/Why did American television change from primarily episodic to primarily serialized?,"I would hazard a guess that, if you were a kid in the 70's/80's that you may just not have watched many of the serialized shows. (of course, I was a kid in the 80's and remember watching all of these...)  Off the top of my head, from the 80's, you've got:   These were all shows that had long story arcs and episodic consistency..."
"What was the first movie to introduce ""blue wire or red wire"" bomb disposal?","A lot of people seem to think Juggernaut is the earliest film to use the ""wire dilemma"" trope.  I found references to it everywhere from Amazon reviews to rap lyrics.  Slightly more reliable references include: Movies you should own: Juggernaut (Terror on the Britannic) The first film to develop the 'red wire/blue wire' dilemma, it's a tense piece directed by Richard 'Superman II' Lester, with dialogue by Alan 'Beiderbecke' Plater, that while featuring an all-star cast is in reality a mesmerising monologue by Harris and a musing on the nature of death. It's a movie you should own. JUGGERNAUT (1974) - a very British disaster movie There's a scene in the film that's famous, but you probably don’t realise it was shown here first. Where the crucial decision has to be made – to cut the blue wire or the red wire. It's also the oldest film listed in Televison Tropes - Wire Dilemma article."
What is it called when a movie breaks the illusion of fantasy?,"It's widely known as Breaking the Fourth Wall. Breaking the fourth wall is when a character acknowledges their fictionality, by either indirectly or directly addressing the audience. Alternatively, they may interact with their creator (the author of the book, the director of the movie, the artist of the comic book, etc.). Wikipedia elaborates about the fourth wall: The fourth wall is the imaginary ""wall"" at the front of the stage in a traditional three-walled box set in a proscenium theatre, through which the audience sees the action in the world of the play. The concept is usually attributed to the philosopher, critic and dramatist Denis Diderot. The term itself was used by Molière. The fourth wall illusion is often associated with naturalist theatre of the mid 19th-century, and especially with the innovations of the French director André Antoine. The restrictions of the fourth wall were challenged in 20th-century theatre. Speaking directly to, otherwise acknowledging or doing something to the audience through this imaginary wall – or, in film, television, and video games, through a camera – is known as ""breaking the fourth wall""."

They're noted as being incredibly dangerous predators. We see a skeleton of one while C-3PO is wandering in the desert before the Jawas pick him up. Obi-wan Kenobi mimicked the bellow of one in order to frighten off the sand-people just before his first appearance in the film."
"""Whatever doesn't kill you, simply makes you stranger"" - what does it mean?","I think it's important to look at (one of) the Joker's origin stories. From The Killing Joke: You see it doesn't matter if you catch me and send me back to the asylum... [...] I've proved my point. I've demonstrated there's no difference between me and everyone else! All it takes is one bad day to reduce the sanest man alive to lunacy. That's how far the world is from where I am. Just one bad day. You had a bad day once, am I right? I know I am. I can tell. You had a bad day and everything changed. Why else would you dress up as a flying rat? You had a bad day, and it drove you as crazy as everybody else... [...] Something like that happened to me, you know. [...] My point is, I went crazy. When I saw what a black, awful joke the world was, I went crazy as a coot! You can see this philosophy behind so much of what the Joker does throughout the movie, notice how many of his crimes involve getting relatively innocent people to commit atrocities. He does whatever he can to give them that one bad day that will push them over the edge. While Batman's sufferings have definitely left him alienated from the regular populace (stranger), they've also made him the man he is (stronger). The Joker's goal is just to corrupt people, to leave them as twisted and messed up as he is. This is particularly evident with Harvey Dent to whom the Joker gives personal attention. You can see his glee in corrupting Gotham's ""White Knight"". Basically, while the Joker has no problem with killing people, he loves it when he can make them as strange as he is. Most of his plans are set up so that one way or another, he'll get an outcome that makes him happy."
Does Sheldon Cooper have Asperger's Syndrome?,"According to the character's actor, Jim Parsons the answer is a confident ""no"", however he does happily admit (and has extensively spoken about) Sheldon's 'asperger's-like' characteristics. JP: When I was first asked about it, I literally hadn’t… Well, I’d heard of the disease. Do they call it a disease? I don’t want to be…  AVC: A disorder. JP: Disorder, thank you. How ridiculous now, looking back, that I said that. I’d heard of the disorder but I didn’t know what it was at
  all. And when I asked the writers if Sheldon had Asperger’s, they
  said, “No, he does not. That’s not what we’re doing.” - AVC Interview and Q. As the show’s gotten bigger, you’ve been adopted by more than one
  community. Rather than say “Hey, do you want to be a spokesman for,
  you know, Pepsi and we’ll pay you X?” people say, “You are now the
  spokesman for Asperger’s.” How do you deal with that? JP: Asperger’s came up as a question within the first few episodes. I got
  asked about it by a reporter, and I had heard of it, but I didn’t know
  what it was, specifically. So I asked the writers—I said, “They’re
  asking me if Sheldon has Asperger’s,” and they were like, “No.” And I
  said, “OK.” And I went back and I said, “No.” And then I read some
  about it and I went, OK, well, if the writers say he doesn’t, then he
  doesn’t, but he certainly shares some qualities with those who do. I
  like the way it’s handled. - Adweek Interview Similarly, the show's co-creators Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady head
indicated that from a writing perspective, the decision was taken not
to have him positively indicated as having a specific condition
because it would make it easier for them to change his character if they needed
to: ""We chose not to diagnose Sheldon,"" says ""Big Bang"" co-creator Chuck
  Lorre. ""Big Bang"" co-creator, Bill Prady, who based Sheldon on computer
  programmers he used to work with, has said they were afraid that if
  they labeled Sheldon an Aspie, they would have too much responsibility
  to depict the condition accurately within a sitcom. - NJ.com Prady also stated in an interview with Slate that Sheldon's quirks are uniquely ""Sheldony"" without necessarily being part of a wider condition. ""I just think of his actions as 'Sheldony.' Some things feel instinctively correct for his character,"" says Prady, who recalls one software colleague who couldn't go anywhere alone that he hadn't been to before. ""He'd say, 'I can't go to 47th Street Photo by myself.' And it was maybe three blocks away. It was never questioned. Quirks were never challenged—they were simply accepted as a quality of the person.""
  ""Are these things Asperger's?"" he asks. ""I don't know."""
How do actors make eye contact with CGI characters?,"If you talk to actors that do a lot of CGI, the answer is ""not very easily"". (Ian McKellan famously almost quit filming The Hobbit because most of his work was acting solo, since they had to CGI in the hobbits later to make them short.) However, there's a couple of techniques that pop up frequently in CGI-heavy movies: The ""tennis ball"". Often an actual tennis ball, but not always. Some small prop will be held at what would be eye-level for a CGI character, and the actors play to that. Because the CGI is added in later, the FX team will just adjust their graphics so that the character shows up where the actor is actually looking, as much as they can. This technique is also used when actors need to maniuplate (touch, hold, pet, etc) CGI creatures, to give them something tangible to work with.  Stand-ins. For CGI characters that are mostly human-sized and human-shaped, often times the actor doing the motion-capture will just act through the scenes (dressed in a motion-capture suit) and be digitally replaced later on with their character. This was done in your example, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, with live actors playing the turtles (click this still image for the video):  Sometimes they will combine the two techniques. In Age of Ultron for example, James Spader in motion capture gear plays Ultron throughout the movie, but early on the character becomes much bigger than a human. For those scenes, they positioned a set of red lights over Spader's head so the actors (in this scene, it's Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson) would remember to look well above Spader's head when talking to Ultron (again, click for video): "
Why are there not any MRI machines available in Interstellar?,"According to Interstellar's screenwriter Jonathan Nolan: Revelation 2:  The death of tech in the film, like GPS and MRI machines, is based on informational extinctions in history. Jonah Nolan: Kip and I spent a memorable afternoon with some fantastic scientists that Kip pulled together to talk through all the different ways human life could be extinguished or hobbled on our planet. It was a very depressing afternoon. [Laughs] I remember being struck by the fragility of life here. Everyone who has grown up in the West and has been fortunate enough to live through a rather peaceful period, every year everything seems a little better. It's hard for us to imagine periods when things go backwards, but they do very, very frequently.  Just in the last 2,000 years, we can identify at last half a dozen periods in western culture where technologies were lost that ancient civilizations had that we still don't fully understand exactly, so you know that there's been knowledge lost since as early as the Middle Ages. What we know about that period survives because of beautifully transcribed manuscripts out on some rocky island on the North Sea. Although it's not our experience, it's frighteningly easy to imagine technology backsliding. So it is basically an unexplained item that is in part thrown in there to indicate the downward spiral of the world. This review explains this concept: A script by Nolan and his brother Jonathan sets the stage, creating a near future world where crops are failing—wheat is gone, okra is on the chopping block, and all farmers can grow with any reliability is corn—and the planet is becoming a giant dustbowl. They accomplish this visually with looming sand storms, as well as through small hints, mentioning food riots, hinting at hard times in the recent past, and painting a society that needs farmers more than engineers. In all of this there are a handful of nice touches, like how the New York Yankees are basically a high school baseball team, and though you’re never sure what happened, you get enough to know that the world has changed. Better now than it was, there’s no military, and things are relatively peaceful, but they blame for the disastrous near collapse of civilization on rampant technology, like MRI machines that could have saved Coop’s wife, or wasteful spending on things like space exploration—it’s now taught in schools that the moon landing was fake."
Why does Obi-Wan say that he'll become more powerful if Vader kills him?,"He is referring to the fact that he will become one with The Force - a technique only a handful of jedi have learned.  As a 'spirit' he will continue to guide Luke, and thus become somewhat omniscient - subsequently becoming more powerful. You might say as an older man, he had become physically weak, but once bonded with the Force he becomes greater than the sum of his parts."
"What do the spear and watermelon jokes in ""Airplane!"" mean?","Overall: These are visuals meant to exaggerate the chaos in a disaster movie's control room much like the various people panicking in it as well as literal s#!% hitting a literal fan. But more specifically: The Spear: As commented above, I always felt this was also a callback to the stock-footage indians that were chasing Kramer in the end of this previous scene: 

 The Watermelon: I always felt this was a comical visualization of McCroskey words (note that it falls when he says 'right down to the ground' and matches his gesture) and a juxtaposition suggesting that the plane will crash in a splat, rather than land, on the ground."
"Game Over, Man...Game Over! - What's the source?","It was the idea of Bill Paxton. As it was told to UPROXX by Bill Paxton himself, (emphasis mine) I'm not great at improvising on the spot. The stuff I improvised was stuff that wasn't in the script, but it was stuff that I'd throw at Jim [Cameron] in a rehearsal.  Jim is a  — his mind's like a steel trap. He'd remember something I'd said when we were rehearsing at a scene we were shooting 2 months later. He'd say, 'You said something when we rehearsing to Sigourney. You said something about the express elevator to hell…put that in here.' That was kind of cool, that was kind of fun. 'Game over, man,' was really the background of the character. I figured…[Hudson] was kind of the enlisted version of Gorman who was the officer, [played by] Bill Hope. He probably came up on video games and back in those days you always … I don't think they do it anymore because I don't play video games but it always at the end of your quarter, [it said] 'Game over.'…'Wow, has anybody ever used that, I wonder? Because it's good.' I had no idea it would catch on."
Is this bar slide trick shown on Cheers real or a visual effect?,"Practical effect Funnily enough, the answer is the fourth comment on the YouTube link you posted.  This comment links to Ken Levine's blog (Cheers screenwriter) describing how this trick was performed. This is referring to the “Endless Slumper” episode of CHEERS from season one, written by Sam Simon and directed by James Burrow. I’ve included the video of the show.  Well worth watching the whole thing. Anyway, here’s how Jimmy and his crack crew did it: A thin clear plastic filament was attached from the corner of the bar to the handle of the mug. Ted slid the mug. As it reached the elbow the filament tugged at the handle and swung it around the counter. Needless to say, the studio audience went nuts.

Why is Gandalf referred to as Mithrandir?,"Gandalf is one of the Istari - practically immortal creatures put in middle earth to guide and help its inhabitants.  He is therefore very long lived and has picked up a lot of different names or nick-names to different people at different times. Mithrandir is a Sindarin phrase meaning Grey Pilgrim or Wanderer (ref: Tolkien Gateway). Sindarin is the everyday language of Elves and therefore the name that Galadriel uses for him. Gandalf, or Gandalf the Grey, or Gandalf Greyhame are just some other names for him - I don't think we are told that any of them is distinctly his name.  Gandalf appears to be the common name used by Dwarves and Hobbits for him at the time of The Hobbit, hence the name we think of him as having."
Why did the girl try to kill herself in the 2009 Sherlock Holmes film?,"I never saw a definitive explanation, but there are three theories: Hypnotism (a person with Blackwood's personality and charisma is likely to be a good hypnotist). This is somewhat confirmed by the script (after Holmes stops Blackwood): The girl has snapped out of her trance, and is backing away from them as best she can Somewhat related to the first possibility, please note that the cult members frequently allow the cult leader to exercise nearly total control, up to suicide (see Jim Jones for one of the more dramatic examples, that gave name to the ""drinking cool-aid"" expression).  Also, while extremely rare in actuality, sacrifice has happened on the more extreme end of BDSM circles and is an unexpectedly popular thing for many in BDSM as a fantasy. The ""victim"" was an actress who was supposed to act like she was about to kill herself, considering that Blackwood pretty much arranged for his own arrest."
Is Batman Begins based on any Batman comic or was it entirely written from scratch?,"Batman Begins is a combination of stories from the Batman mythos, as well as an original story. According to Wikipedia, the starting point for Batman Begins was a story called ""The Man Who Falls""; Jim Gordon was based on the character from the story ""Batman: Year One"". Neither of these stories featured Ra's Al Ghul, who is a significantly different character than the one featured in the comic (both Ra's are leaders of a large group of assassins, and both have a large respect for Batman, but the Ra's in the comics is depicted as being hundreds of years old, regenerating himself in a pool of liquid called ""The Lazarus Pit"". It remains to be seen if the Ra's in the movie makes a similar comeback or not). The film The Dark Knight uses elements from the story The Long Halloween, though again the story is mainly an original story. It was also related that Heath Ledger, who played The Joker, locked himself in his hotel room for weeks to try and get to the core of the character of The Joker, even writing a journal of The Joker's 'thoughts'.

What was the purpose of Saito's presence during the inception job?,"Saito wanted to be present to ensure that the job went his way and that the team was successful.  Having already experienced a failed attempt at information theft (when Cobb and co tried to steal information from him), Saito wanted to put every little thing into his favor, and the best way to do that was to be present at every step. A good example of this is during the planning phase: ARTHUR On a 747 the pilots are up above, first class is in the nose so nobody
  walks through the cabin. We'd have to buyout the whole cabin, and the
  first class flight attendant- SAITO We bought the airline. Everyone turns to Saito. SAITO It seemed... neater. COBB Neater, huh? (gets to his feet) Well, now we have ten uninterrupted
            hours. Also, Saito is the key for Cobb to enter the US without getting arrested.  When Cobb's wife killed herself, she thought they were still in the dream, and she wanted Cobb to join her.  As such she set it up so that it looked like Cobb killed her, hoping that he'd kill himself to follow her.  He is still a person of interest in his wife's death: COBB  If I get on this plane and you haven't taken care of things...
  when we land I go to jail for the rest of my life. SAITO  Complete the job en route, I make one phone call from the
  plane... you will have no trouble clearing immigration. Source If Saito wasn't on the plane when the plan completed, there's a chance he might not have had enough time for Cobb to call him, tell him the job is done, and then for Saito to call his contacts.  Again, being in person was the most sure way to hold up his end of the bargain."
Did Neil Armstrong really do this on the Moon?,"This is addressed explicitly in the biography First Man: The Life of Neil A. Armstrong, by James R. Hansen, which the film is based on, and whose author is presumably the Jim mentioned in wcullen's answer. Armstrong never released any information about the contents of his [Personal Preference Kit]. He agreed to do so for publication in this boo, but reported that he was unable to find the manifest among his many papers. [...] ""I didn't bring anything else for myself,"" Neil would declare. ""At least not that I can remember."" As for Janet, the only thing taken to the Moon for her was the olive branch pin. ""He didn't ask me if I wanted to send anything."" Perhaps surprisingly, Armstrong took nothing else for family members--not even for his two boys, a fact that still distresses Janet. ""I assumed he had taken things to give to the boys later, but I don't believe he has ever given them anything. Neil can be thoughtful, but he does not give much time to being thoughtful, or at least to expressing it."" Another loved one that Neil apparently did not remember by taking anything of hers to the Moon was his daughter, Karen. What could have made the first Moon landing more meaningful ""for all mankind"" than a father honoring the cherished memory of his beloved little girl, by taking a picture of the child, dead now over seven years (she would have been a ten-year-old), one of her toys, an article of her clothing, a lock of hair, her baby bracelet? Astronaut Gene Cernan, just before he left the lunar surface on Apollo 17, had written the initials of his nine-year-old daughter, Tracy, in the dust. Buzz Aldrin carried photos of his children to the Moon. Charlie Duke left a picture of his family on the surface. What if Neil did something for Muffie but never told anyone about it, not even Janet, because it was of such an intensely personal nature? How much more would posterity esteem the character of the First Man? It could have elevated the first Moon landing to an even higher level of significance. Among those who feel so are Neil's sister June, who knew her brother as well as anyone. ""Did he take something of Karen with him to the Moon?"" was June's rhethorical question. ""Oh, I dearly hope so."" Perhaps the mystery will be solved when humankind returns, as it surely will, to Tranquility Base. As mentioned in the existing answers, this makes the incident a plausible educated theory, but I do find the added context w.r.t. Neil's living sons to be certainly relevant. I'm bothered by the exact textual match between Hansen and Singer's report of June Hoffman's response. Were they both present in the same interview? Did she give a word-for-word exactly identical response on two separate occasions? Is either of the two accounts a paraphrase of the other? (Just things to consider.)"
Why do low production studios intentionally release similar films shortly after a big banner?,"To capitalize on the success of its predecessor. Even IMDb said the same in their trivia section: The movie is being released on November 13th, 2018 to capitalize on the release of 'Overlord', which premieres on November the 9th. The same applied to Operation Dunkirk (2017) too. And this is not a new thing, there is a category of such movies called Mockbuster. A mockbuster is a movie created with the intention of exploiting the publicity of another major motion picture with a similar title and/or subject. Mockbusters are often made with a low budget and quick production to maximize profit."
Why did Tony Stark use a normal flip phone?,"He could have used any modern technology mobiles why a flip phone? Per the events of Captain America: Civil War, the Avengers had broken up as a whole, and Captain America was considered by the government to be a fugitive. Towards the end of the film, Capt. sends this phone to Tony (delivered by Stan Lee), with a note that included the following at the end: “So no matter what, I promise you, if you need us, if you need me, I’ll be there.”  It's a basic flip phone because they're arguably more durable and less vulnerable to malfunctioning than the average smartphone, and the battery perhaps lasts longer too. Also, if the only needed function of the phone is to place a call - and it is - then, Captain America didn't need to get a smartphone (or equivalent). since Captain America's phone # is clearly visible to Tony (and the audience at one point.. 615-sth-sth), then, Tony could have just saved Capt's number into his own system, instead of carrying the flip phone around (unless there's special security features also applied to the phone)."
Why do movies think the speed of sound is as fast as the speed of light?,"Because they fail test screenings. The general movie audience does not respond well to realistic depictions of explosions or cannons at a distance. From the other SE, a partial excerpt of a great answer (that you should upvote as well): Most film is art, not life/reality. Sound designers have to match the visual art on screen with the sonic art of their mix, and that usually includes a certain amount of ""realer than real"", suspending some of what we ""know"" about physics in order to tell the story in a way that translates to this 2-dimensional, 2-sense media. Case in point, when we see some big impact on screen, such as a lightning bolt, we as audience members expect to hear it, much as we expect to hear the starship Enterprise whooshing by at warp speed, even though there's no air (and thus no air movement to create the ""whoosh"") in space. We also expect to see it match up with the visual effect on the screen; this both increases the overall impact of whatever just happened, and keeps us suspending disbelief that we're not watching a movie, we're looking through a window into another universe. Hearing a delayed sound effect might jerk us out of the director's world and wonder what's going on with the media system, and once we've left, it's hard to get us back. The speed of sound delay would also, even in the ideal, make us feel further from the action. You see a lightning bolt hit a distant mountainside. 3 seconds later, you hear an ear-splitting thunderclap. While that might be totally accurate to the scope of the shot, in the ultimate ideal of the audience totally suspending reality and believing they're physically in this world you've created, they'll be thinking ""damn, I'm glad I'm not over there"", when in cinema the location of the camera can jump from place to place as needed, and the very next jump cut could put the audience right in the thick of the aftermath of that thunderbolt. You'll also see sound designers architecting a ""double explosion"". They'll engineer a big, powerful explosion sound right at the moment you see it, then the visual effects guys will put in a massive shock wave, and as that passes by the camera the sound designers will add an extra ""whoosh"". Or, with a slight delay (and a really fast shockwave), the designers will engineer a small crescendo to the big boom, so you know it's coming. These little audio tricks aren't what you hear in comparable ""real life"" events, but then again, neither is the sound of a movie punch or a movie explosion compared to the real thing. Slightly related, the Mythbusters episode 165 ""Blow your own Sail"" had a clip titled ""Sounds Bogus"", where they compared actual explosions to movie ones: In a recent episode of ""MythBusters"" on Discovery Channel, show hosts Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman worked with Meyer Sound to investigate whether the ""big bangs""—specifically gunshots and explosions—heard in movie soundtracks are sonically faithful to the real events. The episode, entitled ""Blow Your Own Sail,"" was aired on May 11, 2011. For the recent episode, [the hosts] reunited with ""Honorary MythBuster"" and Meyer Sound Staff Scientist Roger Schwenke, with the goal to compare highly accurate, on-the-scene audio recordings to their Hollywood counterparts. ""Real gunshots and explosions are too loud to reproduce exactly in a theater and would damage people's hearing,"" says Schwenke. ""So the question is: are movie sound effects simply the real sound played back at a safe level, or have they been changed in ways other than just level."" The results showed that the sounds are faked in movies. So aside from making the sounds seem ""real"", there's a safety concern too."
What if a head shaving scene gets messed up?,"It takes a couple of minutes to shave a head, so assuming nothing gets messed up when the initial cut with the shaver is made, any mistakes can just be edited around. If there is a significant mistake when the initial cut is made I assume filming could be stopped, hair could be patched and start the shave again - probably from a different spot. Where some performance is required, like Natalie Portman crying in V for Vendetta (

) they will have some dry runs to get the performance to the director's liking.  Then, it's amazing how only having one chance focuses everyone's mind and even if there is a mistake or if something unexpected happens everyone will know they just have to keep going - such mistakes can give a scene an unexpected dynamic, or make it seem more natural, if Portman sneezed would it ruin the scene?  No, the actor doing the shave would simply act like and uncaring guard and impatiently move her head back into position and continue."
Why did Borden do that to his wife in The Prestige?,"Nobody would have been able to get close to the engineer (Fallon): if they had then they would have realized that he was Borden's twin. So it's not that they had to switch, it's that they both agreed to only live half a life. Not only could they not appear in public together, when one of them was Borden the other couldn't go out as Borden, it could have raised suspicion and ruined his reputation. So Borden got married, and when it was his twin's turn to live his life he had to keep up the pretense that he was married in order to not raise suspicion. The twin then fell in love with their assistant (Scarlett Johansson's character) but could only be with her half of the time and in secret. So they agreed to both live half of their existence for their act, half of their time as Borden, and half as Fallon. If they would have told either of their loves, the wife or the assistant, there was the possibility that they could have revealed the deception they had kept a secret for so many years."
How does Captain America know about Iron Man's parents' fate?,"You have to refer to Captain America: Winter Soldier movie for that.

"What country is the movie Babe set in, in-universe?","No location is ever mentioned in the movie. In fact, the sequel Babe: Pig In The City has Babe travelling to a city called “Metropolis.” In that movie, you can see structures that resemble the Golden Gate Bridge, Sears Tower, World Trade Center, Sydney Opera House and Christ The Redeemer, among others. So, it’s safe to say that there was no intended country or location for the movies."
How and why did Disney reuse animation?,"The reuse of animation in this way is attributed to director/producer Wolfgang Reitherman, and was reportedly done because the animation had already proved to work well in its previous use. From The Real Truth About Disney’s “Recycled Animation” (Medium crosspost), as reported by Jim MacQuarrie regarding an interview with Floyd Norman about a similar viral video (emphasis mine): He nodded, laughed and said, “That was Woolie Reitherman.” A quick check of Wolfgang Reitherman’s IMDB page confirms that nearly every Disney film shown using recycled footage in these videos is one he directed, most notably the Jungle Book, Robin Hood, the Sword in the Stone, Winnie the Pooh, 101 Dalmatians and the AristoCats. “It’s actually harder and takes longer to redraw an existing sequence,” Norman told me, “it’s a lot faster and easier to just do new animation, and it’s a lot more fun for the animators. But Woolie liked to play it safe and use stuff he knew would work. That’s all it was.” Milt Kahl, another of Disney's ""Nine Old Men"" among Norman and Reitherman, confirms in a 1976 interview with Michael Barrier and Milton Gray: Barrier: I can't see how the re-use of animation saves money. Kahl: It doesn't. The funny thing is that most of the time they spend more money trying to figure out how to re-use it than they would [animating the scene from scratch]. I'd rather see it animated from scratch; even if it's a little bit amateurish, at least it's fresh and new. This primary-source reporting was then cited in the Wikipedia article on Wolfgang Reitherman, as notes 15 and 18 respectively: During his tenure, he [Wolfgang Reitherman] frequently used ""recycled"" or limited animation from prior works, presumably because it was a safer method for a quality product, though it was in fact more labor-intensive15, not because it was supposedly cheaper.16,17 Reitherman's use of recycling animation proved to be controversial within the studio as animator Milt Kahl lamented its use stating ""I detest the use of—it just breaks my heart to see animation from Snow White used in The Rescuers. It kills me, and it just embarrasses me to tears.""18 It is possible that Reitherman's original motivation was saving money or tightening deadlines, and that the animators took a cynical or futile view, but in any case the practice is associated specifically with Reitherman and in available interviews fellow animators felt it was less about money than about using what had worked in previous films. For what it's worth, MacQuarrie's postscript update cites different reasons for Beauty and the Beast, in a conversation with Gary Trousdale that still cites Reitherman's precedent: “The scene from Beauty and the Beast that we re-used was done for time, but not money. (well…time IS money, but that’s another story). We were just days from our final deadline to deliver, and we had an entire dance sequence (the last scene of the movie, not the ballroom) to do. Everyone was booked and busy, and we knew damn well that Woolie had established this precedent, so we took the Sleeping Beauty dance, re-sized and re-positioned it, and gave the note ‘Note to Clean-up: clean up Aurora as Belle, clean up Prince Charming as Beast.’”"
Why do movie teams shoot alternate endings?,"There is a wide variety of reasons as to why a movie might have alternate endings. The original ending tested poorly during screen tests:
In this case the director had a specific ending that made it through production, but was received negatively by test audiences, forcing the studio to re-shoot the ending to better please the target audiences.
An example of this is DodgeBall: A True Underdog Story (2004) which originally had Average Joes losing at the end. (Discussed here) The script wasn't completed when the endings were shot:
in this case the details of the script are still being worked on, so the crew shoots multiple endings with the hope that one will eventually be used as the final, official ending. The original ending was seen as too graphic or violent especially studio is trying to hit a specific rating (usually PG-13 instead of R), so the ending will be slightly edited:
An example of this was Thelma and Louise (1991) (discussed here). Only a tiny tweak here, but a fairly significant one — the first ending showed Thelma and Louise's car tumbling all the way to the canyon floor, no doubt getting pulverized in the process. Harvey Keitel's character finds the Polaroid that blew out of the car and looks at it as a helicopter heads down into the Grand Canyon to survey the wreckage. As you probably know, the updated ending is a wee bit more hopeful — we see their car drive off the cliff, but not the aftermath. The studio or the director specifically wants multiple endings: the only example I can think of for this is Clue (1985) where the movie was shot with three different endings, each one would be randomly selected during each showing. Leaving the audience guessing which ending they would actually get."
Why do old gun fight scenes sound so weird and cartoonish?,"To answer this, let's take a quick look at Merriam-Webster's definition of ""art"", specifically the section on synonyms: ART, SKILL, CUNNING, ARTIFICE, CRAFT mean the faculty of executing well what one has devised. If we look at the art of foleying—for this is what we're talking about—it's sort of interesting to note that it's always been at least as much a fashionable thing as a technological thing. In the earliest radio and recording days, there were very simple techniques used to foley, though I think nowadays we tend to underestimate how cunning the early artists got. This Mystery Science Theater 3000 sketch is one of my favorite lampoonings illustrating your very question. Now, why does anything sound the way it does in a movie? Do they record the actual thing in the actual environment and then play it? Almost never. And when that is done, it generally sounds cheap and lacks any kind of emotional impact which is after all the point of effects and movies generally. Let's take a really blatant example that will reflect back on the gunshot question. In the '50s, a realistic rocket sounded like this. Fairly close given the limitations of the technology, right? And Rocketship X-M is mostly silent in space, but not completely—because boring!—and then in the late '60s with 2001 and Planet of the Apes, you got a lot of silence in space.  Then, of course, Star Wars comes along and all of a sudden ships are screaming through space right and left, and basically destroys the ""silent space"" thing for all but the most serious of sci-fi. The audience's expectations were forever changed. Gun and fighting sounds present a bigger, subtler problem. If you've ever heard a fight, for example, you know it doesn't sound anything like a movie. If you've been in proximity to a gun, you know that not only does sound equipment not capture it, you probably wouldn't want to be in a theater where it was duplicated (as it would hurt your ears terribly). So, if you're a foley, what do you do? You're not working in a vacuum. You can't just ""be realistic"", because—to answer your question finally—the audience won't buy it. What you have to do, most of the time, is what the audience expects. At the time, those KAPOING, POW and ZOINK sounds were shorthand for ""this is an exciting and dangerous (but also fun) gun battle"". I often wondered where the ricochets were coming from, myself. What had been hit, and where had the bullet been deflected?  But you really answered your own question: Gun battles sounded like that because that's how gun battles sounded. It's why cars of the era were guaranteed to explode into fireballs when shot with bullets—because that's what cars are supposed to do when shot. The more provocative thing to realize is that movies today are just as artificial in their tropes and effects, and a few years from now audiences will look back on current year movies and be just as amused."
In what order should a newcomer watch Star Wars episodes?,"The Machete Order seems to be a great idea. It is a variation of the method @Nobby suggested, but it leaves out Episode I completely. So the order is: IV, V, II, III, VI The article is long but worth reading, it makes a lot of great points.  A little extract on why Episode I is unnecessary: Episode I is a failure on every possible level. (...) Luckily, George
  Lucas has done everyone a favor by making the content of Episode I
  completely irrelevant to the rest of the series. Seriously, think
  about it for a minute. Name as many things as you can that happen in
  Episode I and actually help flesh out the story in any subsequent
  episode. (...) Every character established in Episode I is either
  killed or removed before it ends (Darth Maul, Qui-Gon, Chancellor
  Valorum), unimportant (Nute Gunray, Watto), or established better in a
  later episode (Mace Windu, Darth Sidious). (already added it as a comment, but I think it deserves its own answer)"
"Is this character hallucinating in ""Stormborn"" (S07E02)?","""That's not you"" is a reference to Season 1 of Game of Thrones, in which Arya tells her father, Ned Stark, ""That's not me"" in response to her having to  go to court and marry a prince. 

 Eddard Stark: You will marry a high lord and rule this castle, and your sons shall be knights and princes and lords (smiles) Hmm? Arya Stark: No... That's not me —Game of Thrones, S01E04, Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things After this touching moment with Nymeria, in which she pleas for her to come with Arya to Winterfell, she realises that Nymeria belongs with her pack, out in the wild, not as a pet or companion, and she comes to this realisation poetically, by using a variation on her own words, ""That's not you"". This has been confirmed to be the official answer by the production crew in behind the scenes or commentary blogs/programmes like HBO's official Making Game Of Thrones website:  Back in Season 1, Ned Stark comes across his younger daughter balancing on the stairs in a Red Keep hallway. Sitting together, he offers Arya a glimpse of what her happy future could be: marriage and children. Knowing herself even then, the young girl looks at her father and simply says, “No, That’s not me.” Now in Season 7, Arya asks her direwolf to come home with her, but is rejected by the creature. Disappointed at first, she realizes that, just like her, Nymeria is not meant to be tamed. —Making Game of Thrones Blog, ""Did You Catch This Thrones Throwback in ‘Stormborn’?"" As well as by series creators, David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, in HBO's Inside the Episode, in which they explore the episode. 

 David Benioff: This scene hearkens back to Season 1. [...] D.B. Weiss: ""That's not you"" is a direct reference to what Arya herself said to her father when her father painted this picture for her of the life she could have as the lady of a castle, and marrying some lord, and wearing a nice frilly dress. Arya is not domesticated and it makes total sense that her wolf wouldn't be either. And once the wolf walks away, at first she's heartbroken to have come this close, then she realises that the wolf is doing exactly what she would do if she were that wolf. —Game of Thrones: Season 7 Episode 2: Inside the Episode (HBO)"
Making nature documentaries: scripting then filming or the other way?,"This article is a very interesting read on nature documentaries. It seems that yes, generally, a nature documentary does at least some scripting first. For example, on the BBC's documentary series 'The Hunt':  The Hunt took three years to film; the beautiful sequence of a blue whale eating krill took two years. The first year, the water was too murky for any of the footage to be usable.  From this source on the making of Planet Earth and Planet Earth II: Anderson, a part-time mountaineer, had been one of the crew who, 10 years ago in the mountains of  Pakistan, captured on video a snow leopard hunting — the first ever footage of its kind — for the first Planet Earth. For the sequel, he was expected to pull it off again, this time tracking down those rarest of central Asian predators in the mountains of Ladakh in India.  Also, for less big productions (from the first article again):  Small budgets and limited time mean that filmmakers use captive animals for hunts, chum waters to send sharks into feeding frenzies, and otherwise sensationalize footage, giving audiences a false impression of animal behavior. I also once watched 'Wilde dieren in Wildlands', a making of a nature documentary made by a Dutch Zoo. Here, they had a very clear idea of what they wanted to film: leaf-cutter ants transporting leafs and naked mole-rats huddling together for warmth amongst others. It was interesting to see how the cameramen would go about staging such shots. Again, this confirms that the general idea about which shots to include comes first, and the actual trying to film those shots latesr. "
Why does James Bond use his real name?,"The use of monikers such as M and Q is, IMO, more to do with tradition and traditional anonymity than secrecy. (See my answer to another Bond question for more on this.) You can see colleagues mingling socially (the opening scenes of Licence to Kill come to mind) and Bond pops up to M's flat on a couple of occasions. M, Q, and Miss Moneypenny are all invited to Bond's wedding in OHMSS, and the scene, IIRC, begins with ""Your Royal Highnesses"". I'd say that this out-of-office mingling isn't done without knowledge of their real names. Furthermore, M is often a well known political appointee just like the head of the real MI6. The first M was a Sir Miles Messervy. James Bond too has an alias within MI6—he is 007. I don't think/consider Moneypenny to be a codename. (The question of why Bond does not use an alias outside MI6 is a good one. While the correct answer to this is, of course, ""because it's the movies"", there is a rather feeble in-universe explanation for this. James Bond's front when he is out on the job is that he is an employee of Universal Exports, a shell company created by MI6. Presumably, this also explains his frequent travels abroad and general worldliness. However, when this alias does not suit his purposes, he happily takes on other personae such as that of Sir Hilary Bray (OHMSS), James St. John Smythe (aVtaK), et al.)"
Have GoT's showrunners reacted to the poor reception of the final season?,"After scanning several search platforms for several minutes I have concluded that no such interview exists, although they must be aware of the dislike. Some of the cast have responded and put out their opinion about the last season one of whom was Euron Greyjoy (Pilou Asbæk) ""The diversity of the fans and the passion they bring to the table is
  admirable, and you want to have all of it. ""You want to have the ones that go, 'This is the greatest show ever
  made,' and you wanna have the people that go, 'I hate this show. I've
  always hated it. I want the books now.' ""You cannot satisfy one billion people, it's not possible. But you
  want to have them commit to the show, even if they don't like it.
  There was a guy called PT Barnum who said, 'There's no such thing as
  bad press, there's only press'."" ""And I welcome everyone – people I agree with or people I disagree
  with,"" he continued. ""And I have on social media been discussing Game
  of Thrones with fans and I will continue to do that, because you owe
  the fans information and they need a place where they can ask
  questions about what they like or dislike and it's totally cool, it's
  passionate. And you've gotta love that. ""Besides that, for me, the twists and turns were logical, because this
  is Game of Thrones, and people have to die. And I would be very, very
  surprised if we end up with a happy ending next week. I know how it's
  gonna end, so I'm not gonna say a word. ""But Dan (Weiss) and David (Benioff) have delivered for seven seasons
  admirable content and I would say they have delivered extremely well
  again this season. But again, you can't please everyone.""  ‘Game of Thrones': Euron Actor Pilou Asbaek on Why a ‘Very Important’ Scene Wasn’t Shown on Screen - TheWrap Seeing as the actors are now defending D.B. Weiss and David Benioff it is evident they are aware of the dislike but don't care to comment. Other than this (thanks to @KRyan) it seems like some other cast members are shying away from commenting of what they think about the eighth season as shown in this little compilation. 

 I'm having trouble with transcribing some of the content seeing as there is so much background chatter, but it mostly consists of cast and crew members uncomfortably laughing off the question, ""Are you happy with how things ended?"" Some more quotes are available about the Cast's thoughts about season 8 over here."
"Why is the movie titled ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind""?","My interpretation is well represented by the term ""ignorance is bliss"". 
The point of the film is to create ""spotless minds"" by removing the memories that cause turmoil, jealousy etc. 
""Eternal sunshine"" is a metaphor for ongoing peace, happiness and carefree. 
So in full ""Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind"" is describing the happiness and joy one can experience once the negative experiences (or ""spots"") have been removed from your mind. "
How did Mr. Bean manage to make money?,"He works.

Why exactly did Walt leave Gray Matter?,"The question is answered very well here in an AMC blog posting an interview with the actress who played Gretchen: Q: What’s it like have Bryan Cranston curse at you? A: Oh man, he’s a good actor. But it was easy because Vince Gilligan told us exactly what went down between the characters off screen: We were very much in love and we were to get married. And he came home and met my family, and I come from this really successful, wealthy family, and that knocks him on his side. He couldn’t deal with this inferiority he felt — this lack of connection to privilege. It made him terrified, and he literally just left me, and I was devastated. Walt is fighting his way out of going back to that emotional place, so he says, “F— you.”

What happened to the bodies in American Psycho?,"Bateman is a psychotic schizophrenic and none of the events depicted actually happened. Looking at the evidence presented by the movie, we see Batemen commit acts that anyone as high profile as him could not have done without raising at least some questions. During the film we are presented his crazy subconscious mind that allows him to easily obtain a threesome with two prostitutes while physically beating them, going into what seems to be murderous rampages over business cards as well as seeing an ATM that tells him to insert a kitten instead of a card. All of these events can be explained as happening inside Bateman's mind rather than in real life. In reality, one could argue the only true act that happened during the film was breaking off his engagement with Evelyn due to his realization of his psychotic visions becoming more and more intense as the film goes on. In the end, Bateman seemingly kills dozens of police officers, something that would not easily be forgiven, forgotten, nor without being the talk of the town and also among his socialite 'friends'. Even his 'confession' is aluded to by his lawyer as a laugh as they believe Bateman is too reserved to commit such acts. This further portrays him as actually battling inside his head most of the time, instead of a physical representation of his acts. It can be argued that while his psychotic visions are occurring, he is actually just sitting, silently, slightly catatonic while these play out inside his thoughts."
"Are there any rules around when something can be described as ""based on a true story""?","There are no rules as to when or how the term ""Based on a true story/real events"" can be used.
Sometimes it is a legit claim, but sometimes it is a pure marketing decision to fool the audience. Basically you have 4 types of movies that make this claim: The fake true story The fictionalized true story The altered true story The real true story   An additional case was mentioned by Steve-O in the comments (slightly paraphrased): Movies that were ""based on a true story"" but where certain details were fictionalized because producers thought the actual facts were deemed too hard to believe by the audience. This is actually a variation of the 3rd case: The altered true story.
The normal case is that, to make the movie more appealing, the true event is exaggerated.
But there exists a reversed version, where the true event is made less awesome.  An example of this case can be found in Public Enemies
The scene where John Dillinger escapes jail and takes 3 people hostage with a wooden gun is factually incorrect.
It was actually 17 to 33 people (depending the sources asked. Either the jail administrator or Dillinger himself).
However the director, Michael Mann, believed that this would be too unrealistic. As mentioned in the comments Fargo is another prime example of the 1st case.
A movie that is advertised as ""a true story"", but was completely made up.   However this is a nice example for another reason.
The ""true story"" claim was so successfull that many people believed that the money from the movie was really buried somewhere.
Which lead to the urban legend around Takako Konishi, a Japanese woman who supposedly travelled to the USA and died of exposure to the extreme cold while looking for the buried money.
Because this in turn created a movie of case 3, the altered true story, called Kumiko the Treasure Hunter. Which tells her story, but is largely fictionalized."
Is Forrest Jr. actually Forrest's son?,"There are probably a lot of opinions about this. My opinion is that he is.  But one thing I am sure of is that there are two clues in the movie. Their inclusion into the movie plot indicate that the creators wanted you to conclude that Little Forrest is in fact Forrest's biological son. When Forrest first finds out about being a father, he asks if he can be with Little Forrest. He goes over to him, sits down, and they both start watching TV. From that point on their actions are identical: They get caught up in the show at the same time, AND they tilt their heads slightly to the left at the same time. Later on, we see that they both love the same things naturally. Little Forrest loves to fish. Once again they get caught up in the sitting ""action"" of fishing with their heads tilted slightly to the left. Please observe this YouTube clip that shows the father and son tilting their heads to the left. Forrest, the father, goes to his son at around 4:20 minutes; they tilt their heads at around 4:38 minutes.  

 In this YouTube clip, we see at 1:11 minutes that Little Forrest has a knack for ping pong. At 1:18 minutes, both father and son are fishing and again have their heads tilted slightly to the left.

Why do the lights go out when someone enters the dining room on this ship?,"Because they have a limit switch on the door, which does this automatically when enabled.  It's manually set by crew as part of dog-zebra procedure, or relay-controlled from the bridge.  The underlying purpose is to darken the ship to avoid sighting by the submarine at night.  This is done in a ship's state known as  Dog Zebra material condition in the US Navy, and other navies have similar procedures, as do merchant marines, for the same reason.  In movies/TV, the most well-known example of material conditions is the ""Set Condition One throughout the ship"" callout, used in in Battlestar Galactica 2004 and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (on Klingon vessels), both Ronald D. Moore joints.  If you're wondering... X-ray, Yoke and Zebra are elevating levels of securing internal hatches and valves to improve watertightness. ""Dog"" is an amendment to ""Zebra"" that means ""also do not emit light"". "
Why can Arya still use the faces?,"In the show, Jaqen still uses his name, which hints at the fact that a name is ""earned"". The No One ordeal is, as @KutuluMike said, a test. By the end when Arya kills and scalps Waif, Jaqen tests her again by saying ""So a girl truly has become no one?"" Arya passes the test by saying ""A girl is Arya Stark from Winterfell."" It was at that moment Jaqen smiled quite knowingly and thus Arya had earned her name from the Many-Faced God and became a Faceless Man. The season finale episode only confirms her initiation into the Guild of Assassins by the fact she is still able to use the magic given only to Faceless Men by the Many-Faced God."
"How old is Charles Muntz during ""Up""?","According to Disney Wikia: Considering that Muntz is in his early 20's and Carl is 9 at the beginning of the movie, and that Carl is 78 by the time he takes off with his house, Muntz could be over 90 years old when they meet. And there is a link to a tweet from Lee Unkrich (director of Coco and Toy Story 3) in which it states: At the beginning of the movie, Carl is 9, Muntz is 23. Per Pete. (Pete being Pete Docter, co-director of Up) If at the beginning of the movie, Muntz is 23, and it has been 69 years. Then Charles Muntz is 92 when he meets Carl."
Why does Walt leave his watch at the gas station?,"On talking bad aired directly after the finale Vince Gilligan stated it was down to a continuity error.  When they shot the flash forward scene in the first episode of season 5 Walt wasn't wearing a watch. Therefore they had to have it removed. He also said there was an ""artsy fartsy"" which was that Walt didn’t need the watch anymore as he was about to encounter Jesse, who gave him the watch, for the last time. But ye. The primary reason is the continuity error."
What accent did the actors use in Black Panther?,"From State.com (emphasis mine): Beth McGuire: Visually, that’s where we were. Linguistically, what we did is we honored the genealogy of the precursor to Black Panther—Captain America: Civil War. T’Challa’s father, T’Chaka, played by John Kani, is in the previous film. John Kani is from South Africa and he’s Xhosa, and he’s playing the king of Wakanda. So, Ryan and I went back-and-forth and talked about it, and I said it just makes sense. If that’s who you started with, that’s your king of Wakanda, that’s who it is, that’s the language. And so we did. We chose Xhosa, and it’s a very challenging accent, but it was kind of the kosher thing to do if we’re going to look at the genealogy of who they started with in the Marvel story. What was interesting, also, was that the young T’Chaka is played by John Kani’s real son, Atandwa Kani, in real life. So they picked the accent associated with the actor's real-life ethnicity/national heritage, to be particular the Xhosa people's accent. Note: Beth McGuire is dialect coach in Black Panther"
Where is Jon going?,"In S08E04 The Last of the Starks, when Jon is saying goodbye to Tormund, he tells Tormund that the freefolk are welcome to stay in Winterfell but Tormund tells him he will take his people beyond the Wall where they belong, where they like to wander around. He also says to Jon to come with him beyond the Wall as Tormund believes Jon has got the North in him. The real North.    Tormund: I am taking the Freefolk home. We've had enough of the South.
Jon: This is the North. Freefolk are welcome to stay.
Tormund: It isn't home. We need room to wander. I'll take them back through Castle Black as soon as winter storms pass. Back where we
  belong.
Jon: (looks at Ghost) It's where he belong too. A direwolf has no place in the South. Will you take him with you? He'll be happier up
  there.
Tormund: So would you.
Jon: I wish I was going with you. This is farewell then.
Tormund: (hugs Jon) You never know. You've got the North in you. The real North. When Jon is sentenced to a life of serving the Night's Watch, he goes there and finds Tormund.    At this moment, the North is an independent kingdom with Sansa as the Queen. Jon is done serving his people, doing his duty. If he stays at Castle Black, he would have to be a Lord Commander possibly.    But he decides to just go away from his vows and duties and promise and just be free for once in his life. Free from all the burden of expectations of who he is supposed to be.   Edit 1:- based on comments
1. It is very unlikely that Jon is going beyond the Wall for ranging. The Night King and Army of the Dead are defeated. There are no threats to range for. Also, he was the only one from the Nights's Watch going with the Freefolk.
2. As suggested by @krb, Jon turns back one last time towards the Wall with a melancholic look, a bittersweet look if you will, towards the realm he guarded for so long.   Edit 2:- Interview with Ramin Djawadi (Music composer for Game of Thrones)  Renfro: Did you have any conversations with showrunners David Benioff and D. B. Weiss about what is going on with Jon specifically? I feel like the shows ends on this optimistic note, where he's half-smiling and there are children around him. The children's presence felt really important in that scene, because it's this mark of the future and possibility. At the same time it's a little sad, because he's going into exile, basically, and leaving behind his past life. Were there conversations about that? Djawadi: Yeah, absolutely. The idea is really that he stops and he looks back, and then the main title starts, and it's the idea of a new beginning. It's supposed to be positive and yeah, like you said, the fact that there are children around and [other] people — he's not just by himself.
Originally [he was] with the Night's Watch, and you're not allowed to have a wife and children and all that, but this is him going out there with the wildlings, and you can interpret it like he's starting a new life. He's a changed man, and he's leaving the past behind, and so it's definitely supposed to be something positive. There are many possibilities now — that's how we can look at it."
Why did Vader passively accept being killed and replaced at Palpatine's command?,"I think you've completely misinterpreted that scene. Vader is not just passively standing there and watching the Emperor torture Luke to death, and far from showing how evil Vader had become, the scene is actually the point at which Vader comes back to the light side. Have another look at the scene (thanks to @Paulie_D for linking it). From the moment the Emperor begins torturing Luke, Vader finds himself torn between his loyalty to the Emperor, and his love for his son. He looks at the Emperor, then down at Luke. Then back at the Emperor, then down at Luke. He knows he has to choose between them, and he chooses Luke: he picks the Emperor up and throws him to his death, at the cost of his own life. 

 The 2011 Blu-Ray version makes it more explicit, dubbing over a small ""No"" as he watches Luke get tortured, and then a louder ""NO!!"" as he moves forward and seizes the Emperor. It's quite apparent that, at that moment at least, he does care about Luke. It's also worth noting that Vader was never actually that loyal to the Emperor in the first place. As early as Episode 3, he was planning to overthrow him and rule with Padme (which of course, did not happen): ANAKIN: The Chancellor is weak! I can overthrow him! He tries it again after he learns that Luke is his son. His entire motivation for trying to turn Luke to the Dark Side is so that they can overthrow the Emperor and rule together: DARTH VADER: Join me, and together we will rule the galaxy as father and son! As for why Vader seems to simply accept his fate when the Emperor orders Luke to kill him, there are three reasons: DARTH VADER: It's too late for me, son. TL;DR: Vader did care about Luke, he wasn't just standing there and watching him get tortured to death, and while he served the Emperor, he wasn't as blindly subservient as you believe him to be."
How do they film movies that take place in a single season?,"Principal photography, where the actors are in front of the camera, usually takes less than 3 months. But principal photography is just one part of producing a movie. The whole process can take a year or more. Movie production is generally broken into 3 stages: Pre-production: The script is finalized, crew and cast are hired, there are rehearsals, teams build the sets and scout locations, make costumes, props, apply for permits, etc. This usually takes several months. Principal photography: The actors are on sets, or on locations, being filmed. This takes 1-3 months, typically. Post-production: Edit the film, score the film, add special effects, ADR (recording the audio of voice-overs and the like), marketing, etc. This is often the longest part of a film's production schedule, commonly taking 6 months or more. So principal photography can easily be completed within one season. But it doesn't even need to be. As others have pointed out, much of what you see is ""movie magic"": fake snow on the ground, the actors pretending to be cold when it's actually summertime, etc. Also, the environment only needs to look like a particular season for shots taken outdoors! If the actors are indoors, they can shoot that at any time of the year that they want."
Why hasn't the elevator been fixed?,"It's just a reoccurring joke that management is lazy and how extensive the damage was. The elevator was damaged due to a malfunctioning experiment of Leonard's (He wrongly calculated the mixture for the experimental rocket Fuel he was developing), which Sheldon recognized as going critical so he placed it in the elevator. It exploded inside and took out the entire elevator cab. (The Staircase Implementation, Season 3, Episode 22) The cost of a new elevator cab (and maybe the motor/hydraulic system and everything else) and structural repairs to the elevator shaft for a ~8 story building like that would be in the low to mid 6 digits. And would be a labor intensive multi-month project. From a New York Times Article on modernizing an Existing, working elevator system: In a six-story building, a standard elevator modernization (frequently involving replacement of the cab rather than remodeling it) costs about $100,000, including consultant fees, said Joseph Caracappa, an elevator consultant ... A project in a 6- to 12-story building generally costs around $125,000, while anything taller will require roughly $150,000 to $175,000. [He] on my building’s project, said that these figures assume that some components won’t need changing. Our 89-year-old drum-hoisted elevator, being well past its sell-by date, needed everything, which is why our job cost substantially more. Also, we spent about $20,000 on the interior finishes, on the higher side of a range from $7,500 to $30,000. That's putting a regular fix at < $200,000. An explosion would likely add much more cost to it.  Between the High Cost, the amount of work required, and not having anyone to blame/sue/recover the cost from, it's understandable why the elevator has not been fixed."
Why does Hollywood not use foreigners in foreigners' roles?,"This is not entirely the case from what I have seen. More frequently, a specific type of character (Russian, for instance) is played over and over again by the same, small, group of actors well known in the entertainment community. The same Russians get the same Russian parts. The same Italians get the same Italian parts. If the part is too small to bother, or the actor sought is not available, studios don’t bother trying to develop new talent for a one shot deal. They would rather go with someone who can get close to acting the part. And, they will count on the audience suspending their belief for the sake of the storyline. The belief being that it is better entertainment to have good acting than realistic portrayal. Especially when the portrayal of the character must be exaggerated for the audience to get what would normally be subtleties. Case in point, I like action movies. Combat movies are shot predominantly with actors who have never been trained in combat. Instead, they go through a crash course on combat techniques. Then, their scenes are choreographed for the maximum visual effect. The audience impact is valued over the actual realism. Even if it means that certain effective combat techniques are replaced with those that would go against actual training, be ill-advised, or be down-right disastrous  in actual combat. When actual combat veterans are cast in speaking roles, the realism of combat scenes increases. But, the acting and dialogue quality suffers. It is not in the combat veterans’ skill set. Can it be taught/learned? Yes, at the expense of time. But, it is much easier to teach an actor how to act like the character at the expense of realism."

What is the point of the Red Thread/Tape around evidence or newspaper clippings?,"The practice is called link analysis, and its purpose is to show us how certain people may be related to each other or specific events. It's not done so much by hand anymore in the manner you see, though perhaps this is still the case in some underfunded backwoods police bureau. These days we use highly sophisticated software like IBM i2 Analyst's Notebook or other visualization tools like Neo4j that effectively does all that stringy stuff. We use it extensively in busting fraud rings. Suppose we see a ton of local victims claiming credit card fraud. Using these tools we can map out what they all have in common (they all ate at the same restaurant over the course of a week) and cross-reference with some other data set (like employee shift schedules at that restaurant). Then we find a connection between each victim and perhaps discover a bartender who served all of the victims. And so on... It is my understanding the CDC uses similar tools to track epidemics."
"Did Roger Rabbit exist prior to the film ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?""","Roger Rabbit originated not as an animated character, but rather as a literary character in the 1981 book ""Who Censored Roger Rabbit"", where he played a sidekick to Baby Huey. This book was later adapted to the film ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", released in June of 1988. However, Roger makes at least one appearance as an animated character before the release of the 1988 film. He made a cameo in Sport Goofy in Soccermania, which came out in 1987. This was the only pre-film appearance I could find. He also makes several appearances that postdate it, notably in November 1988, where he appears in ""Mickey's 60th Birthday"", where he mistakenly uses a stick of dynamite for a candle and blows up the set.  There are also a couple of appearances (""New Character Day"" and ""Buster and Babs Go Hawaiian"") in Tiny Toons Adventures that also postdate the film release."
Why is there a disclaimer about not accepting money from tobacco companies at the end of movies?,"According to the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement, 1998, tobacco companies cannot pay for tobacco brand placement in movies.  Additionally, there is a history of litigation for “negligent advertising”: Negligent advertising - the tobacco companies failed to warn consumers of the risks of smoking cigarettes By my non-lawyer reasoning, there appears to be certain risks in accidentally portraying a movie as somehow advertising a tobacco product. Because it would be an accident, they have no way of being completely sure that they did not make a mistake. But they can include a disclaimer saying they did not get paid for any tobacco advertising. If they did not get paid, there was no advertising contract because there was no consideration (a legal term indicating that something of value, like money, exchanges hands in order to have a legal contract). There even has been research associated with trends in showing tobacco products in movies as a result of the Master Settlement Agreement. There has been a marked decline in the number of movies with TBAs [tobacco brand appearances] released after the MSA [Master Settlement Agreement]. However, the greatest absolute decrease occurred in R-rated movies, and the decrease seen in movies rated for adolescent audiences was not statistically significant."
"Is lens flare shot organically, or added in post-production?","According to the Business Insider article Why 'Star Trek' Has so Much Lens Flare it was all done in-camera and it was all intentional. ""There are so many movies from my childhood that had those that when we were shooting 'Star Trek' I remember saying to Dan Mindel, the DP [director of photography], 'It would be so much fun if we' — I didn't think we were going to have quite that number of them, but it became this thing, and it was ridiculous,"" he said. Abrams recalled Mindel bringing in these giant powerful halogen spotlights called ""best in show"" on set and they would use them while filming. ""It became this weird kind of artform of how to make the perfect lens flares with different kind of lenses,"" said Abrams. ""And it was just this thing that sort of felt like it was a kind of visual system for the movie."" So unfortunately there isn't a version without the lens flare. Abrams did apologize for the overuse of lens flare after his wife complained that the lens flare was so bad in Star Trek Into Darkness she was unable to distinguish who was on screen."

Kill Bill colour changes to Black and White,"Kill Bill is basically a homage to dozens of films from the past, which were generally shown in black & white on television to cut down on the gore. The same happened to Kill Bill to be able to achieve an R rating and be released in theatres. IMDB's trivia section confirms this: The black and white photography is ultimately an homage to '70s and '80s US television airings of kung fu movies. Black and white (as well as black and red), were used to conceal the shedding of blood from television censors. Originally, no black and white photographic effects were going to be used (and in the Japanese version none are), but the MPAA demanded measures be taken to tone the scene down."
How does Thanos know where all the infinity stones are?,"Quite possibly because he orchestrated things so that the stones would be revealed. At the end of Age of Ultron when Thor is going to leave he says: Thor: I have no choice. The Mind Stone is the fourth of the Infinity Stones to show up in the last few years. That's not a coincidence. Someone has been playing an intricate game and has made pawns of us. But once all these pieces are in position... Source: Transcripts Wikia > Avengers: Age of Ultron consider also that it was Thanos which gave Loki the Staff which had the Mind Stone in it and had hired Ronan the Accuser to find Power Stone, or at very least the Orb know it was in it Ronan: I promised Thanos I would retrieve the orb for him. Only then will he destroy Xandar for me. Nebula, go to Xandar and get me the orb. Ronan: The orb is in my possession, as I promised. [Korath holds up the orb in his hand]
Thanos: Bring it to me.
Ronan: Yes, that was our agreement. [Ronan takes the orb from Korath] Bring you the orb, and you will destroy Xandar for me. However, now that I know it contains an Infinity Stone, I wonder what use I have for you.
Thanos: Boy, I would reconsider your current course. [Ronan opens up the orb and looks at the Infinity Stone inside]
Korath: Master! You cannot! Thanos is the most powerful being in the universe.
Ronan: Not anymore. [suddenly Ronan embeds the Infinity Stone in his warhammer and absorbs its power into his body] You call me ""boy!""

"""A galaxy far, far away..."" -- from where?","It is difficult to answer this without the “opinion” sin, but Star Wars was very dear to Lucas. It was a story he had worked out in his head for a long time and written several drafts for. It's also based on many things from the past. The Force is loosely based on ancient religions and martial arts. “Energy is in all things, let it flow through you.” “Sense danger.”  I have read in the past that it is particular to a religion from Thailand, I think, but I could not find a source to back that up. The story is based on the movie The Hidden Fortress. Lucas has said this. It is a story from historic Japan. The theme and the lead character’s journey is strongly influenced by Joseph Campbell’s book A Hero with a Thousand Faces. Campbell’s point, if I can summarize, is that the Hero’s story is almost always the same and it is something everyone can related to. Pretty much everyone relates to Luke, they might like Han better, they might like Leia better, but they relate to Luke. The story felt, to Lucas, familiar and ancient. He did not want to approach it as a brave new world or interesting future, which is how Star Trek, as one example, kind of approaches its world. Lucas felt like he was retelling an old story, not presenting a future. A long time ago in a place far away, or something similar to those words is often used at the beginning of fables and it is familiar to most movie-goers. It has a story-telling ring to it, and those words have been used in Aesop and other story-telling venues. I believe Lucas wanted to start out by giving the movie viewer that familiarity. He did not want the first impression to be a space-ship chase. He wanted the first impression to be “This is an old fable.” because that is what it was to him. Then he followed that with a magnificent space-ship chase, which was a brilliant contrast in my opinion, and wonderfully backed up by the orchestral music. The whole approach was brilliant. But I think his reason for doing it went beyond the contrast. I believe, he genuinely wanted to begin by telling the viewers “this is a fable”, because that is what long ago and far away suggests. He wanted to begin his movie with that familiarity. And, just to add, “Rescue the Princess” is also straight from countless fables. The movie still works as a futuristic looking space adventure, but it has got its roots in fable."

Why did Lucius interrupt Bruce during their Sonar/Submarine discussion?,"Was it just a subtle bit of humour to subvert the audience's expectations that they were going to compare it to bats using sonar to navigate? ...but it's also a not-so-subtle nod towards the fact that, even if not spoken out loud, that Lucius Fox isn't stupid and knows exactly what Bruce is doing with the technology.

Did the Fresh Prince producers ever consider reshooting the title sequence?,"As explained in this deliciously in-depth article: “When it was time to shoot the main title, we went with the people
  behind the video of ‘Parents,’” says Andy Borowitz. Scott Kalvert came
  in with a treatment that deliberately stayed in line with what had
  inspired the show. “The idea was ‘Parents Just Don’t Understand,’
  ‘Girls Ain’t Nothing But Trouble’ and ‘The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air’
  were all somewhat the same song and video,” says Townes, who appears
  in the video as one of Smith’s basketball buddies. “We basically took
  our experience of making records and videos and turned it into the
  intro of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.” Note that this doesn't mean they used the same actress: According to Townes, there’s also another casting rumor to clear up.
  Apparently, the mom in the “Parents Just Don’t Understand“ video and
  the “Fresh Prince” intro are not the same person, despite claims."
What format do movie theaters now use?,"Whilst there are some cinemas that still retain use of 35mm projectors, it's fair to say that these are only used for special events. Modern cinema, by which I mean the industry that distributes and exhibits mainstream content (so any new releases), are exclusively distributed in digital format. In early 2002, Hollywood sought to standardize this technology for the incredible advantages it possessed. Digital projectors have been industry standard since 2005 in the UK, but much earlier in America and China. Due to its cinematic heritage and relative size, the UK is almost always used as the 'control' in rolling out cinematic technologies. It is usually measured as an experiment, and just as the introduction of sound, colour and 3D cinemas required refits and refurbishment, this is now happening with digital distribution.  The rest of the world is moving in exactly the same direction, but with different levels of immersion in the cinematic process. Many cinemas use a system called DCP which is literally a USB pen that gets shipped around inside a case. It improves accountability on behalf of cinema-pirates, as each Pen has a certain number of licences on it. A slightly more old fashioned variation of this is large portable hard-drives, but these are being phased out of circulation too. A DCP is simply a file that requires activation from a licence. The DCP is signed for by the cinema, and then the projectionist is given the licence activation code to allow the content to be played. Some cinemas have a licence retainer, or master licence for content. Because most multiplex cinemas are part of an exhibition chain, they are typically less vigilant in safeguarding their content, and will handle the management of their content internally, negating such stringent protection.  Increasingly, satellite technology is being explored in order to reduce the cost of distribution (which has already more than halved in the past 10 years). Under satellite systems, the film is literally downloaded from a secure server and the film is activated for use via satellite; projectors can even be controlled remotely through the satellite, which centralizes the entire process externally. This is a method that has been spearheaded in the UK by such projects as National Theatre Live and Opera Live. Whilst they do broadcast globally, they remain a minority interest for exhibitors (although a growing one, due to their success). The legacy of these projects will not, however, come from their content but by their method of distribution. Even now, many distributors are promoting their ease of use as leverage to persuade developers to pursue satellite distribution as it reduces the overheads dramatically. As with many instances of private enterprise, the real driving force behind satellite distribution is the revenue stream it creates, and the relative immediacy of this income.  It's the worst kept secret of most cinemas that the most lucrative single-income source is the adverts that are exhibited before a feature. To explain: a single multiplex may have an opening weekend for a particular film that takes a significant box office. To take this quarters tentpole (Avengers:Age of Ultron) as an example;  A 12 screen MP may take an optimistic BO:W/E of £36k (approx $55)... so if a film has legs for a month and its returns are inevitably diminishing week by week, we're looking at a best case scenario of £70k ($100,000 dollars): and let me stress this would be an absolute wet dream for a cinema to make these numbers on a single film. Advertisement, by comparison? for a modest 5 screen art house cinema, you're looking at an annual income of about £200K ($300K)... and that is, most importantly, guaranteed.  Adverts don't need to be good; infact, they're often awful. They don't rely on word of mouth, critical acclaim or any amount of audience reception. They're a guaranteed revenue stream that will double the best possible B/O of any film, they're value increases proportionately to box office takings: they (sadly) represent the backbone of modern cinema. Here's the hook: almost every advertisement content company in the world is moving not only in the direction of digital content, but they're universally moving towards satellite. Why? because, comparitively, it costs pittance. With the exception of implementation (which usually consists of a satellite receiver and something called a [LANSAT processor][4] [Loca-Area-Network-SATellite]), this type of distribution entirely cuts out the cost of getting the content to cinemas. Distributors simply author a file, fire it out over their satellite connection for their respective exhibitors to download (or stream if its live content: hence satellite and not unpredictable fibre/internet connections) and deal with any potential problems through modifying the coding; which is in itself rare. If we compare this to traditional methods of P&P (Print and postage), the gains are obvious. Film has to be printed onto celluloid, which is costly and creates only one copy. If you want to open in every cinema in the US (unlikely, but lets pretend this example is a Star Wars Scenario) you're looking at 40,000 prints. Now try and imagine a global box office...so quadruple it, at least. You also have to factor in the cost of transportation of said prints, degradations and recirculation, repair (the days of 35mm splice jobs are long gone, and not soon missed) and, most overlooked of all...insurance. Many people realise that films stock used to be made of the incredibly flammable silver nitrate, as demonstrated during the finale of Tarrantino's Inglorious Basterds. During these early days of cinema, the relative hazard of transporting these prints was absorbed by the distribution companies. When insurance firms became common practice, this cost was phased onto them... and when the film stock changed and became less hazardous, what did the insurance firms do.....? Not give a f%!k.  Even up until digital content distribution, insurance companies refused to acknowledge that the relative risk of transportation had diminished, and were able to charge disproportionate costs for film distribution; a practice that continues with 35mm, although it's a dying market so prices are dropping significantly. Satellite distribution has removed all these overheads completely, and there is simply no feasible alternative on any medium to large scale operation. It's fair to say that most if not all cinemas are now fitted with digital projectors, and within the next 20 years (as they become satellite compatible) we will probably see the extinction of the projectionist: they'll become something that's wheeled out on special occasions to demonstrate a vestigial technology, to show off its novelty. That's more or less the case now, actually.  [4]: http://lansat.com/ a brand name"
'Yeah but it's a dry heat' - reference to another film?,"It's an old joke/cliche dating back many years but it's not movie related In Arizona, Texas and other parts of the west, the temperature often averages over 100 degrees during the summer. “But it’s a dry heat!” is the clichéd response that some natives give, explaining that it’s more tolerable without humidity. “The thermometer frequently registers 120 in the shade, but it’s a dry heat, and one doesn’t notice it at all” was cited in print in 1910 to jokingly describe the heat in Southern California.

Why the stoic acting style in 2001 Space Odyssey?,"I have watched all of Stanley Kubrick's movies. He wants you to know that he's in control of the pace of the movie. You'll be fed each line when he's ready to feed it to you. All of Kubrick's movies tend to have a lot of white space, empty space where no one is doing or saying anything; they are merely existing. Listen to the non-human pace of Nicole Kidman's character (in Eyes Wide Shut). You are hanging on every word. Kubrick creates tension through his use of pace. The actors aren't being stoic. They are moving and speaking at a real life pace, not the pace of normal movies."

"Why are trailers called ""trailers""?","As it happens, Priceonomics has already investigated this: Built in the early 1900s, the United States’ first permanent movie
theaters featured only one screen. Things worked a bit differently
back then: you’d pay your nickel, take a seat, and watch a continuous
loop of a feature (mixed with cartoon interludes) for as long as your
heart desired. In 1912, Broadway producer Nils Granlund was hired as the advertising
manager for a chain of East Coast movie theaters owned by entrepreneur
Marcus Loew. Here, Granlund produced the first-ever trailer -- a
one-minute spot for the upcoming Broadway show, The Pleasure Seekers
-- which featured mainly cut up clips from the production’s rehearsals. The advertisement was shown to audiences after the feature
film, rather than before it. That's for a Broadway show, but movies followed: That same year, in Chicago, an early film visionary by the name of
William Selig decided to apply 19th century society’s interest in
print serials (stories published in installments) to films. What
resulted was a 13-episode film serial called “The Adventures of
Kathlyn.” As with print serials, it was important for Selig to end
each segment on a suspenseful note, so as to encourage people to come
see the next one. To do this, he decided to include a brief teaser of
""next week's"" installment at the end of each one. But when did they start appearing before the main movie? Most film historians contend that at some point in the late
1930s, theaters began showing movie trailers before the feature film
rather than afterward -- most likely because serial-style films were
on their way out, and patrons often left the theater immediately
following the film. Showing the trailers before, while the audience
was obviously captive, proved more effective. And yes, people have tried renaming them: “[Studios] have tried calling them ‘previews,’ or ‘prevues of coming
attractions,’” reasoned a Paramount producer in an interview--
but society has, so far, refused to accept anything other than what
it’s used to. Go read the whole article, it is fascinating."

What is the Ancient One's mistake?,"Question: What is the Ancient One's mistake? Before explaining, it's important to mention/keep in mind that the Ancient One has the ability to see the future (but only so far). Going into the events of The Avengers (as shown in Avengers: Endgame), the Ancient One most likely foresaw Banner asking her for the Time Stone. However, as the OP quoted, it's the duty of the Sorcerer Supreme to protect the Time Stone at all costs. That being said, her initial intent was to not give the stone to Banner. The reason why the Ancient One didn't already know about Strange's actions (i.e., Strange willingly giving the stone to Thanos) during the time of her and Banner's conversation is because she died in Dr. Strange; and, just as she told Strange right before she died, she wasn't able to see past that moment in time (nor was she able to see Strange's actual future... only its possibilities). ANCIENT ONE: I've spent so many years peering through time, looking at this exact moment. But I can't see past it. I've prevented countless terrible futures. And after each one, there's always another. And they all lead here, but never further. ... I never saw your future. Only its possibilities. So, her coming to learn about Strange actions in Avengers: Infinity War was new information to her, and, with her knowing that Strange is the best Master of the Mystic Arts, she then says that perhaps she made a mistake [in judgement] when initially not wanting to give the Time Stone to Banner (and then immediately gives it to him)."
What did the title of Silence of the Lambs refer to?,"It refers to a conversation between Clarice and Hannibal Lecter. In order for Lecter to help with her investigation, he demands she tell him information from her personal life, to satisfy his curiosity.  Her story begins with her upbringing in West Virginia with her father. He was later shot. She lived with her mother, but was sent away to live with her uncle as she couldn't afford to keep her. Her uncle owned a sheep and horse farm, and she learned one night that the lambs on the farm were slaughtered - in horror, she ran away. This story is covered in the script. Note the highlighted part towards the end: Clarice (voiceover): Lambs. The lambs were screaming... Dr. Lecter: They were slaughtering the spring lambs? Clarice: Yes...! They were screaming. Dr. Lecter: So you ran away... Clarice: No. First I tried to free them... I opened the gate of their pen - but they wouldn't run. They just stood there, confused.
  They wouldn't run... Dr. Lecter: But you could. You did. Clarice: I took one lamb. And I ran away, as fast as I could... Dr. Lecter (voiceover): Where were you going? Clarice (voiceover): I don't know. I had no food or water. It was very odd. I thought - if I can even save just one... but he got so
  heavy. So heavy... Clarice (voiceover): I didn't get more than a few miles before the sheriff's car found me. The rancher was so angry he sent me to live at
  the Lutheran Orphanage in Bozeman. I never saw the ranch again... Dr. Lecter (voiceover): But what became of your lamb? (no response) Dr. Lecter (voiceover): Clarice...? Dr. Lecter: You still wake up sometimes, don't you? Wake up in the dark, with the lambs screaming? Clarice: Yes. Dr. Lecter: Do you think if you saved Catherine, you could make them stop...? Do you think, if Catherine lives, you won't wake up in the
  dark, ever again, to the screaming of the lambs? Do you...? Clarice: Yes! I don't know...! I don't know. The Catherine referred to is the U.S. Senator's daughter who is kidnapped and who Clarice is trying to locate. The implication is that by saving Catherine, by saving this innocent girl (innocent like the lambs), she'll no longer be woken by the howling of the lambs in her dreams - the lambs she was too weak to save. Instead, she'll have saved the innocent and she'll be able to sleep in peace."
Why were the bells ignored in S8E5?,"While some will argue she has become as mad as her father, I will argue she has all her mind.

And as Machiavelli says:  From this arises the question whether it is better to be loved rather than feared, or feared rather than loved.

  that is horrible to lots of people. However, she is not totally emotionless, and it's true that there is rage inside her when the bells tolls. Because at this moment, she realised that she could have easily take Kings Landing, two seasons ago.  She realized she could have dealt with the Night King threat after becoming Queen. She lost two dragons, Jorah, Missandei, and a big part of her army, while a simple attack with only one dragon was enough. She realized all those previous sacrifices were useless. While it seems odd that the same character rule in a quite different way between two realms, this is not unrealistic. Bruce Bueno de Mesquita, political scientist and game theorist, studied the reign of Leopold II, King of Belgium and Congo. The exact same person rules these two kingdoms in very different ways, but there is a reason for this: the power was not held by the same people/structure. Two different kingdoms, two different ways to conquer/keep the power.  Abstract 
  From 1885 until 1908 Leopold II was not only the King of Belgium but also the personal owner of the Congo Free State. The policy outcomes during his reign turned out to be fundamentally different in the two countries: Whereas in Belgium he improved living conditions, in the Congo he established a brutal tyranny. This paper analyses the reasons for these different leadership styles of Leopold II by means of the 'selectorate theory'. The selectorate theory explains policy outcomes as a function of governance institutions. It assumes that the ruler maximizes his own utility which means first of all to sustain himself in power. Under Belgium's governmental institutions Leopold II required broad support from the general public but in the Congo he only needed a very small group of supporters. To reduce the possibility that Leopold's different leadership styles were caused mainly by racism his period is compared to the reign of the Congolese leader Mobutu Sese Seko. 
Leopold II and the Selectorate: An Account in Contrast to a Racial Explanation, Bruce Bueno de Mesquita The same thing can be said for Essos and Westeros. In Essos, she is seen as a liberator and can earn the love of her people, whereas she is seen as a conqueror in Westeros, and must rule with fear"
Is Bran literally the world's memory?,"What Bran is referring to is his ability to use greensight to see the past, something he has been able to do at will since inheriting the role of Three-Eyed Raven. For example, he was able to look back and see Jon's true lineage. Bran seems to imply that this ability is unique to the Three-Eyed Raven - He'll come for me. He's tried before, many times, with many Three-Eyed Ravens. This could also serve as an explanation for Bran's purpose as the Three-Eyed Raven, to be ""the world's memory."" Samwell also comments on the importance of Bran's ability - Your memories don't come from books.
  Your stories aren't just stories.
  If I wanted to erase the world of men, I'd start with you. So, the answer is no, the world will not literally forget everything. However, there will be no one left who can ""remember"" everything."
Why was the Ancient One so hesitant to teach Dr. Strange the art of sorcery?,"So why was the Ancient One hesitant to accept him in Dr. Strange? AO: You think I was wrong to cast him out.
BM: Five hours later he's still on your doorstep. There's a strength to him.
AO: Stubbornness, arrogance, ambition. I've seen it all before.
BM: He reminds you of Kaecilius.
AO: I cannot lead another gifted student only to lead him to darkness. So, she threw him out and presented hesitance to teaching him because he has a gigantic ego and thinks he knows it all, and because just recently she had lost another pupil to Dormammu (not to mention that he insulted her and was quite aggressive when they first met). Lastly, even if the Ancient One was able to see some moments of the future that are certain to happen (i.e., Strange becoming the best Master of the Mystic Arts), it's still important/necessary to play out the events that lead up to it."
What is the meaning of Teddy's last dialogue in Shutter Island?,"To Live as a Monster If he accepts his guilt and becomes sane he will become the Monster. His delusions are his brains way of removing this guilt and hiding the fact that he ignored his family, did not act on his wife's mental illness, allowed her to murder their children and then murdered her. By accepting what the doctors are telling him he will need to go on living in the knowledge that he allowed terrible things to happen and did terrible things. The doctors will be able to treat him without a lobotomy but he will be fully aware of the crimes he committed.  To die as a good man In his delusion he is a good man. He truly believes that he is on the side of law and order and that he is doing right. If he chooses to continue to believe this he will be lobotomised and will no longer have relevant brain function to question what he did or did not do. The death is not literal as the other answer suggests. It is about the fact that if he continues to believe he is this good man he will be lobotomised and effectively ""die"" believing in this. He will not die in a literal sense until later, but he will do so in the belief he was a good man.  What is most exciting and cathartic about this decision is that this appears to be a moment of lucidity where he understands what has happened and is not in thrall of his delusions. He at this point of lucidity makes the decision that he can not live with his crimes and would prefer to lie to his doctor as he knows this will result in his lobotomy.  By making the statement to his doctor he makes him aware of this also and by virtue of this you could also argue that he is being a good man by electing to be punished as well as the belief in his delusion that he is good.

What is Jack Nicholson tossing aside in this scene in The Shining?,"Aluminium plate rings, used for separating dinner plates between plating up & serving; keeps the food warmer for longer. Plate rings have a characteristic bottom lip which will 'hook' over the plate beneath, & sloped or slightly curving sides, to meet the moulded ring on the underside of the plate stacked above, preventing slippage.
They may have lids, though more usually another empty plate would be placed on top.  For serving - room service etc - a version with an integral lid would be used instead.  Here's a blow-up of the best frame I can find showing 2 of the rings - sloping sides, curved top, external bottom lip; precludes the possibility of cooking ring, baking tin or pie-dish upside down.  For comparison to the most likely alternatives…
Baking tins or pie dishes would have a flat lip on the inside, to provide stability for the flat base insert.
A cooking or mousse ring would have no lip at all & also have parallel sides to enable the food to slip out more easily. Sandwich [cake] tin - flat lip to keep the insert stable  cooking or mousse ring - parallel sides, no lip, edges bent & formed to the outside to keep the inner face as clean as possible.

How do they make tattoos in movies?,"They're actually just glorified 'lick & stick' - thin 'not quite plastic' decals adhered to paper backings, which are wetted with a mixture of water and alcohol and applied to the skin. 
I imagine they're very similar to the ones you can find on the cosmetics counter in some chemist's (though I've never used those, so that's a guess). They will start to rub off if mistreated, but at the end of the day, alcohol and cold cream will remove them properly. How I know - I've had to wear them a few times myself... they itch ;-) I managed to Google this...
The company 'Tattooed Now' is one that makes these decals.
Customized Tattoos shows some still on their paper backing and
How to Apply... gives pretty much the same info as I précised above.   Seems they did actually make the tattoos for Point Break, and a few other high profile movies. This site - Love to Know : Movie Tattoos - has a bit of background on the history of movie tattoos - which used to be done originally in ordinary stage make-up, then later in an alcohol-based skin paint; but they were very laborious & had to be touched-up frequently."
Why are laugh tracks only used in TV series but not in movies?,"The usage of laugh tracks in a TV show dates back to early television and the necessity of shooting a scene multiple times. While the performances of cast and crew could be tailored to fit the scene, the ""audience laugh"" - the aural cue to the viewer that something funny had happened - couldn't be controlled as easily. Once audiences had seen that scene once or twice, the laughter would either be at the wrong time or too short, or worse no one would laugh at all since they'd seen the ""punchline"" multiple times.  The main reason behind the usage of laugh tracks is to replicate the experience of being with an audience while viewing. Watching TV at home is usually a solitary experience, so film-makers attempted to recreate the atmosphere of a theater by introducing laugh tracks. Eventually this expanded to include a range of emotive aural cues - applause lines, the ""awww"" moment, cheers and whistles during romantic scenes, etc. More specifically, though, why are laugh tracks not used in film when they are so prevalent in TV? Largely because films are intended for the theater, and in the theater the viewer will be surrounded by an audience. In the theater, the rule is ""laughter begets laughter"", so if you can make a few people laugh or applaud, other audience members will pick up on that and produce genuine laughs as well. The same can be said of comedy shows or political rallies that use ""plants"" to generate the same effect - a few paid supporters who will laugh or cheer at the right time, thereby encouraging others to do the same. The same ethos applies to laugh tracks stimulating laughter in the ""at home"" audience. "
How were Opening Titles and End Credits created before Computers?,"Usually, if we talk about credits without any movie scene in the background, it was done by using a long sheet of paper or plastic or other material they want with credits written on it. Artists used different type of fonts and texts as required. Then this sheet is rolled in front of a camera where it is recorded and added into the movie. They also used various types of fonts and color themes to convey the genre and/or subject of the movie in the title cards. If we talk about the credits with some movie scene running in the background, it was done using an Optical Printer. This is also used in layering for special effects in old era. An optical printer is a device consisting of one or more film projectors mechanically linked to a movie camera. It allows filmmakers to re-photograph one or more strips of film. The optical printer is used for making special effects for motion pictures, or for copying and restoring old film material. Common optical effects include fade outs and fade ins, dissolves, slow motion, fast motion, and matte work. More complicated work can involve dozens of elements, all combined into a single scene. From this Canva article, film titles – the graphic image or sequence at the opening of a movie – were simply hand-illustrated cards photographed and inserted into a film. Today, they are much like a mini-movie showcases the art of graphic design with filmmaking."
"What happened to the humans in ""Cars"" (that is if they ever existed)?","However...there is a semi-official answer... The Cars franchise has never offered an official explanation for any of these mysteries. But there is an internal document at Pixar that has never been shared with the public that answers some of these questions, and lays the ground rules for this unusual cinematic universe. It’s called “The World of Cars Owner’s Manual,” and it was written by Jay Ward, the Creative Director of the Cars universe. Screenrant Ward was asked where do the cars come from and gave this response. ""If you think about this, we have autonomous car technology coming in right now. It’s getting to the point where you can sit back in the car and it drives itself. Imagine in the near-future when the cars keep getting smarter and smarter and after one day they just go, 'Why do we need human beings anymore? They’re just slowing us down. It’s just extra weight, let’s get rid of them.' But the car takes on the personality of the last person who drove it. Whoa. There you go."" Ward acknowledged that some of them rules are occasionally broken...but Number one on the list: “You’ll never see the doors open,” Ward said. “Because the brain and the eyes are in there, we don’t want anything falling out of the side.” The interview continued... Ward did offer  one other possible explanation for the world of Cars. “[Cars 3 production designer] Jay Shuster did a great drawing a long time ago of a meteor hitting the earth,” Ward said, then mimicking a “Poof!” sound effect. “And all the humans are gone and all of a sudden the cars start rising up and moving around.”"
Where does Sherlock get his money?,"In the TV Series, Sherlock calls himself a Consulting Detective.  Whilst it is not completely certain that this involves payment, it is certainly conventional for you to pay a consultant in any sphere.  Watson is also involved, and spends some of his time blogging about Shelock's successes, presumably not just to enhance his reputation but to 'improve sales' It is true that Sherlock cannot be bought, he will not take a boring well paid assignment for example - but there is a specific example where he is paid.  In The Blind Banker, Sherlock's old university friend who is in a senior position at the Bank offers the two of them a significant fee - Sherlock walks out disinterested in such petty matters but Watson, the more practical one, collects the cheque. Finally, it is implied that Sherlock is from a wealthy family.  It may be the case that he has inherited money.  EDIT: Actually from later episodes in Season 3 it seems that while his family are not poor, they don't seem to be ridiculously wealthy - so this can be discounted. In terms of scientific equipment - Sherlock is probably not above 'blagging' equipment off people, borrowing it for an extended period to help his work."
Does Babyface Nelson represent anyone from The Odyssey?,"George ‘Babyface’ Nelson is Achilles.  You can read about it in Achilles and Baby Face Nelson: Modernization of Character in O Brother, Where Art Thou? by Carrie A. Alhelm-Sizelove. Nelson, like Achilles, is a person who fights for his ego and to gain fame. As Achilles fought in the Trojan war for fame, George is robbing banks during the Great Depression not to help the poor people but to get known. There is no deeper motive behind their doing. And George’s Achilles’ heel is his baby face. "
Why did three actors play Darth Vader?,"David Prowse definitely did not have the right voice. He is from Bristol in the UK, and has a Bristolian accent, what would be described as in the UK as a 'west country accent'. To many ears this sounds a little parochial - most people would think this more the accent for a farmer than a galactic enforcer for the Emperor, however unfair that comparison might be.  However David Prowse was a body-builder, had acting experience so he had the right look at 6 foot 6 inches tall.  He was also from the UK where many of the scenes involving Vader were made. James Earl Jones is to a degree the opposite - he has an amazing voice, and although a more accomplished actor than Prowse, does not have the right bodybuilder physical presence and is (only) 6 foot 2 inches tall. Finally, why Sebastian Shaw and not Prowse for the final scene with Vader? They may have thought that Prowse, only in his late 40's, might look a little too young to be Luke's father, and the accent would have been too striking a difference to the 'in helmet' voice.  Of course with the later casting of Hayden Christensen as the young Anakin, the age would have been about right."
Why does T-1000 try to force Sarah Connor to call her son?,"The T-1000 had past experience of trying to imitate Janelle (John's foster parent).  It tried to pretend it was her when John rang to warn them.  But it took the wrong tone with John & he knew something was off.   So that attempt failed, and it got to confirm that when it checked the dog's name.   That, added to the damage it had sustained, probably convinced it that imitating a woman that was even closer to John would be a failure.  Hence, next strategy, torture compliance out of Sarah (which ended just as poorly, in the short time it had access to her)."
Are scorpions frequent in US suburb gardens or is this a plot exaggeration?,"The story of Honey, I Shrunk the Kids takes place in Fresno, California.  In that area of the state, scorpions are rare, but not totally unheard of.  No scorpion native to central California is considered dangerous to humans (this does not take into account shrunken children). The appearance of the scorpion appears to be that of an Indian Red Scorpion, but that would make it an escapee from an exotic bug collector rather than a native."
Was The Nightmare Before Christmas meant to be a Halloween or Christmas Movie?,"According to the film's director Henry Selick, it's supposed to be a Halloween Movie. According to The Daily Mail Henry Selick, 64, who directed the 1993 film recently spoke about its themes at a Q&A at the Telluride Horror Show in Colorado.
  He was asked whether the film is a Halloween or Christmas movie.
  Henry explained that, while Christmas plays a factor in the story, at the end of the day, The Nightmare Before Christmas is a story about Halloween And from Entertainment Weekly “It’s a Halloween movie,” Selick responded, finally putting the debate to rest. Why? According to this transcript the director stated: ""It's a Halloween movie,"" he said, definitively. He acknowledged that a lot of people liked the Christmas Town stuff waaaaay better than the Halloween Town (""They love Santa and say he's all-powerful,"" he said), but he had to tell the truth: this is a movie about Halloween, and the people of Halloween, and how they react to something like Christmas.

What God does Captain America believe in?,"In the MCU, I don't think Steve Rogers has ever explicitly declared his religion. The circumstantial evidence would suggest he's Christian or Jewish, with (IMO) the more likely case being Christian. As a final point, in the source comics, he's definitely Irish Catholic. He has discussed his upbringing as the son of an Irish Catholic family and how his family's faith made an impression on him. While the MCU Steve Rogers hasn't made the same claim (and is unlikely to do so explicity, I suspect) that would fit well with the rest of his character."
Did this character show any indication of wanting to rule before S8E6?,"This is just a plausible theory.    I was very disappointed that after training for so long to become this magical creature called Three Eyed Raven, Bran did nothing significant when it was expected of him. He plays no part in the fight against the Night King, no warging his way into the undead dragon to kill the Night King. He just sits there and pretty much everywhere else this season.    In order to seek closure for his character, I think he can see the past present and future. He knows what is about to happen, with the Night King, with Daenerys, with Jon. So he just plays along doing nothing, letting the present play out towards the future he has seen.    He says to at least 3 characters that everything they did brought them where they are now, where they belong. Jaime, Theon, and Jon. Every one of them says to Bran that they wish things had been different, that they could have chosen differently. But Bran says to all of them that they were exactly where/who they were supposed to be.    This makes me believe Bran is just letting the present plays into the future without interference.    A possible reason could be because he turned Wylis into Hodor by interfering in the past. So he's afraid or guilty.   He must have seen him be King. Hence he says he travelled all this way. When Tyrion says he doesn't want to be Hand, Bran says he doesn't want to be King either.    He says he came all this way to become King but he doesn't want to be King. So, he's letting the present play into the future without interference.    Bran knows, like Theon, Jaime and Jon, that things could have been different if they made different choices but he also believes the things he actually chose led him to where he is now, where he belongs. A King.    Does that make sense? Maybe only to me."
Is there any way for Wakandan people to regrow the Heart-Shaped Herb?,"Is there any way for Wakandan people to regrow the Heart-Shaped Herb? First, should we assume garden of the Heart-Shaped Herb is the only place to grow it? I bet we shouldn't, first we should know how it came into existence: “People who read the comics would be familiar with the Heart-Shaped Herb and the ceremonies that surround that,” Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige said to Entertainment Weekly. “That’s partially spiritual. We certainly don’t call it magic, but there’s Vibranium that has been interwoven within that soil and that land for thousands of years, so there are other things going on with it.”-  CBR So we got lots of Vibranium and we have extra ordinarily talented T’Challa’s sister Shuri, so she might be a hope in regrowing the Heart-Shaped Herb again or we can assume in the whole of Wakanda, there might be other places where natural grown Heart-Shaped Herb exists there. But it will be all speculation until we see it in any sequel itself. Or they can make synthetic one like comics : When Erik Killmonger used the Heart-Shaped Herb his body reacted badly and poisoned him. After he barely recovered he used his scientific knowledge to create a synthetic version that would grant anyone the abilities of the Black Panther. He later allowed Kaspar Cole to use the synthetic version to gain powers similar to the Panther. - wikia"
Why do the machines keep humans alive if they have nuclear reactors?,"Well, whatever the reason machines keep humans alive, it is definitely NOT because of humans' excellence in the role of batteries. However it is possible that the machines themselves are spreading that myth. (For example Morpheus would believe anything the Oracle says). That machines don't really need humans for power is revealed in the last part, when the Architect agrees to free all humans from the Matrix. The actual reasons may be much more complicated, and much more humane. The machines just don't want humans to become extinct, just like we humans are trying to protect Siberian tigers, as well as other endangered species. Even though a tiger may kill a human given the chance. However protecting humans is much harder than the tigers. You can't put them in a cage, because then their minds will degrade. You can't let them roam free, because they probably won't survive in the new world, or because they will probably keep trying to fight the machines until they kill themselves. Humans aren't very rational, you see. As a solution, the tandem Matrix - Zion was created. The Matrix is conveniently situated right next to the Zion so that people in Zion can focus the majority of their energy in ""freeing"" others from the Matrix. Also, quite conveniently, the Matrix lacks any real defense mechanisms. If there was just Zion without the Matrix, the humans would be trying to develop nuclear weapons or EMP bombs in order to launch the assault on the machines. Obviously they would fail, but they will also kill themselves in the attempt. If there was just Matrix without Zion, then such system would run a risk of collapsing and destroying the humankind if some unforeseen catastrophe occurs. The machines aren't really good at adapting to sudden changes. And they are vulnerable to other unpredictable factors (such as Agent Smith). The machines know that, but they can't do much about it. Now why do they need to destroy Zion every now and then? Well, first of all they probably don't see it as much of a big deal -- the population of Zion is comparatively low. Plus they want to keep them from acquiring too dangerous technologies. Plus in most cases the goal is not really destruction, but rather the threat of destruction. For example in the last movie, several EMP charges could have destroyed the majority of attackers. The machines know that, and they probably launched the attack with the goal of failing, but making humans more scared. The machines didn't foresee however that Agent Smith would be able to interfere and stop those EMPs. So in summary, it's all a well-orchestrated plan to keep humans busy, and alive."

"In Iron Man, why is Tony Stark fooled for so long?","Mostly the answer can relate to simple plot device, while one point strikes at me that you make.  You mention him talking to people in his company, but to me, it is vividly displayed that Tony Stark is essentially a playboy asshole, and not many people would be friendly to him.  Maybe a take-over was known, but not to the extent of trying to kidnap him in the middle of the desert during a demonstration was company-wide knowledge.   Also, just being a mechanical genius doesn't mean he is a people genius.  In his logical brain, thinking villain was actually against him the whole time would not cross his mind because he regards villain as a personal and family friend."
What happens to questions that aren't revealed during Jeopardy?,"According to this interview with Alex Trebek promoting The Jeopardy!

  there’s always an extra there for emergencies or technical problems.

  used later if you write that same category again or you really like

"Director's Cut, Editor's Cut, Theatrical Cut. What do these mean?","Wikipedia's Film Editing page defines many of these cuts. I will try to summarize the questioned ones here. Editor's Cut: An editor's cut (sometimes referred to as the ""Assembly edit"" or
  ""Rough cut"") is normally the first pass of what the final film will be
  when it reaches picture lock. Additional: The article says that editing starts right after photography starts, utilizing the dailies, so the edited product grows with the director's submissions. Director's Cut: When shooting is finished, the director can then turn his full
  attention to collaborating with the editor and further refining the
  cut of the film...where the film editor's first cut is molded to fit
  the director's vision. Additional: The Director and Editor mold the editor's cut by shifting scene order, reshooting, associating music, etc. until the Director is satisfied with his movie. Final Cut: (BTW - no glossary I looked into had a 'Theatrical Cut') Often after the director has had his chance to oversee a cut, the
  subsequent cuts are supervised by one or more producers, who represent
  the production company and/or movie studio. Additional: The article says sometimes disputes with producers arise forcing a tempermental director to sever ties with the final cut of the movie. IMDB lists these types as 'Alan Smithee' films, though other pseudonyms are currently allowed.This is just one article defining these -- there are a number of movie glossaries listed on Google to define these terms from (supposedly) film classes at .edu sites -- and generally speaking a ""Theatrical Cut"" refers to the original version released to cinemas."
How did Angier know not to appear in The Prestige?,"I guess he just recognized Borden from the people examining the apparatus while he stood in it and assumed that he will probably walk behind the stage (or maybe even saw him do that). The fact is, that Angier was at that point in time so much sunken in his wrath against Borden and the desire to know how his Trasported Man worked, that he didn't just do those Real Transported Man shows to make a good show and beat Borden success-wise. He actually planned this ""murder"" to happen some day to finally ""win"" against Borden, since he knew he would show up one day to look behind the stage and nobody would doubt that he murdered his enemy. But even if at first Angier looked like the one that always got framed and played wrong by Borden (and finally murdered, as is shown at the beginning of the movie) it was actually always Angier who took this fight from a job-related competition to a higher level, involving kidnapping and finally murder. This is also to some degree evident from his dialogue when he says: Cutter: What kind of booking are you after?
Angier: The one that Borden can't ignore. So he was prepared for Borden to show up some day and just needed to look out for him, the rest was already planned out perfectly."
Did Tyler Durden forget his name?,"In addition to Orion's answer, I'd add that while it's not specifically stated in the movie, I think it's implied well enough that the Narrator's name is not Tyler Durden. Tyler says at one point that the Narrator is ""slowly letting himself become Tyler Durden."" If his name was actually Tyler, this line wouldn't make any sense. I suspect the movie avoids telling us his real name as a clue that he and Tyler are the same person. It was very clever indeed. I still remember the first time I watched it and Marla is asking him his name, ""What's your name? It's not on your card. Is it Radith? Corneleus? Any of the stupid names you give each night?"" The bus passes in front of her, ending the scene so we don't get to hear the Narrator's answer . . . and it didn't phase me one bit. It just seemed like a neat way to end the scene. Fight Club is definitely one of my top ten movies of all time."
Why was Pepsi free in 1985?,"""Pepsi Free"" was a caffeine-free version of Pepsi introduced in 1982.  This product would have been familiar to Marty in 1985, but unknown to a soda jerk in 1955, hence the joke. In 1987, after the movie was released, Pepsi phased out the use of the name ""Pepsi Free"".  It is now known more descriptively as ""Caffeine-Free Pepsi"".  (From r/vintageads) In addition, a can of diet Pepsi Free can be seen next to Marty's clock radio in 1985.  Note that scene linked in the OP also has some wordplay on the word ""tab"", which can mean a running bill at a restaurant or bar but was also a sugar free soft drink introduced in 1963 (and is still around today).  Again, the scene plays on the differences between a word's meanings in 1955 versus 1985."
"""No Country for Old Men"", why is it called so?","First of all, the movie is based on the novel of the same name by Cormac McCarthy. Numerous times in the course of the movie you can see Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) expressing his thoughts on a moral corruption in society nowadays and often compares it to the time of his predecessors (""oldtimers""). One example quote taken from IMDB: I was sheriff of this county when I was twenty-five years old. Hard to believe. My grandfather was a lawman; father too. Me and him was sheriffs at the same time; him up in Plano and me out here. I think he's pretty proud of that. I know I was. Some of the old time sheriffs never even wore a gun. A lotta folks find that hard to believe. Jim Scarborough'd never carried one; that's the younger Jim. Gaston Boykins wouldn't wear one up in Comanche County. I always liked to hear about the oldtimers. Never missed a chance to do so. You can't help but compare yourself against the oldtimers. Can't help but wonder how they would have operated these times. There was this boy I sent to the 'lectric chair at Huntsville Hill here a while back. My arrest and my testimony. He killt a fourteen-year-old girl. Papers said it was a crime of passion but he told me there wasn't any passion to it. Told me that he'd been planning to kill somebody for about as long as he could remember. Said that if they turned him out he'd do it again. Said he knew he was going to hell. ""Be there in about fifteen minutes"". I don't know what to make of that. I sure don't. The crime you see now, it's hard to even take its measure. It's not that I'm afraid of it. I always knew you had to be willing to die to even do this job. But, I don't want to push my chips forward and go out and meet something I don't understand. A man would have to put his soul at hazard. He'd have to say, ""O.K., I'll be part of this world."" Even though Sheriff Ed Tom Bell doesn't appear on screen very often (compared to Chigur and Moss), he is the narrator and the protagonist of the movie. So, the title refers to the moral decline that gave birth to evil (Chigur) and depraved (Moss) individuals and made modern society unsuitable for ""oldtimers"". Some links:"
"Why is ""Captain Marvel"" translated as male in Portugal?","Ok, in English this is gonna be weird to explain, but as this link explains, it has to do with the official patent designation. In Portugal, there is the woman ""Primeiro-Ministro"" (Prime-Minister in Male form), and a woman ""Presidente"" (President). What is officially registered for the post is ""Capitão"" (Captain), and as Carol Denvers is a former air force pilot, that's what she is called. There is no ""Capitã"" for any post in the air force."
Why did Steve Rogers choose this character in Endgame?,"Although they are Russo's words, I don't agree to their reasoning. I do, however, agree with their decision to pass on the symbol of Captain America to Sam.    Bucky is fighting for the right side now but that doesn't absolve him of the crimes he committed. Him being brainwashed doesn't erase his sins.    At the end of Civil War Bucky is still a criminal in the world. He has taken refuge in Wakanda and is healing. He doesn't leave Wakanda and fights with the Avengers and gets snapped. When he is blipped after 5 years and fights and wins with the Avengers saving humanity, however great his contribution may be, he still committed murder in his past and will be questioned as a criminal if not by law then by the media.    Bucky won't be an unquestioned symbol of integrity. His past and PTSD won't allow him to make the right decision at all times that is expected of Captain America.    Sam, on the other hand, fits the role perfectly. A retired war hero, who helps others with their PTSD, who got back into the field to help Captain America, when no one else would, was branded a fugitive and traitor, but did the right thing everytime no matter the personal cost.    He's the perfect candidate in terms of Steve because he sees himself in Sam.    He's the perfect candidate for the world, with unquestioned integrity.    Also, Steve had seen Bucky's mental and physical suffering and would rather let him rest and live out his days as a normal being. To get a life. "
Empire Strikes Back - Scene in Dagobah with Darth Vader,"This is to reflect Luke's own darkness and how he must overcome it.  He sees Vader as the face of true evil which is why it is envisioned here as him.  Vader never actually appears there, physically.  When it is shown that Vader has Luke's face, this is to represent Luke's own fear of becoming as evil as Vader (if this scene occurred a movie later, it would more likely represent his fear of becoming like his father). I'm sure Yoda, as old and wise as he is, tells Luke to go in unarmed for either his own protection against himself and/or because he knows the cave is just where a lot of dark presence is and shows hallucinations to test Luke, rather than to physically fight anything/anyone."
Red's parole hearings in The Shawshank Redemption,"I'm not sure if I'd agree with parts of Wbogacz answer.  The Humility part specifically.  I always got a more resigned vibe from Red. He doesn't believe that the board will really grant his parole, and as such doesn't see the point in lying to them.  He is honest, sincere and expresses true regret for his actions, rather than trying to convince the board that he's been ""Rehabilitated"" as he did in the prior attempts. I don't think there was any intimidation either. If I recall the scene correctly, Red sat in a relaxed pose for the interview, not in a leaning forward threatening manner."
"What is a ""soap""?","TLDR: A ""Soap"" is a serialized show that's about ordinary people having interpersonal drama.  There's not a high concept, story arc, external villains, or greater purpose. Don't confuse ""serialized"" and ""soap opera"". What serialization isn't: From the 1960s to 1990s, in the vast majority of TV shows, every episode starts the same, and ends right there. Wesley has saved the day, Riker's latest fling has moved on, Sam Beckett has finished his work and ""quantum leapt"", Monk and Psych solve the case, etc. The show always reset back to starting conditions; no evolution ever happened, it's jokingly called ""Groundhog Day"".  That's because real money was made in syndication, and small stations don't want to deal with airing sequence, and want a show anyone can start at any episode and enjoy. If you catch the show every Monday at the laundromat (even though it airs daily), that should work. Non-serial: almost any sitcom, 2-1/2 Men, The West Wing (mostly), Star Trek: Next Generation Some shows threw away the opportunities for syndication, to tell a deeper tale in a big story arc.  The archetypal example being Babylon-5.  They became serialized - there are fewer (or no) ""Groundhog Day"" episodes, events cause irrevocable changes, and it's super confusing to join in the middle.   If you catch the show every Monday at the laundromat, you'll be totally confused - why is Babylon-5 fighting Earth all of a sudden? You're expected to watch from episode 1. This is a big difference between serials and soaps - you can't possibly watch a soap opera from episode 1; they're so hastily produced they didn't even keep the tapes. The prototypical soap opera was a show like General Hospital. These aired for 30 minutes every weekday.  They were cheap shows to begin with, and at that tempo, they pretty much had to be done live, or in a live (3-camera) format with very simple editing.  They were so cheap they didn't bother filming or videotaping the as-aired episodes.   Needless to say, they're not meant to start watching at episode 1; you're expected to join the fun today and then tune in tomorrow, and they're written to encourage that and to ""hook you in"".  For that reason they avoid  ""big head"" stuff like revolution plots or intergalactic wars. That's what makes House of Cards not a soap. Soap opera was the (sarcastic) name, since they aired between 11 am and 3 pm, were mainly watched by homemakers (housewives), and so the commercials were homemaking supplies such as soap. As the definition was broadened to include things like Dallas which were not midday daily shows, critics latched on to the term ""soap"", and it stuck. But the writing makes them a ""soap"" - it is hasty, and all about interpersonal relationships, because that's universally appealing and easy to film in simple sets. There is high drama amongst the characters with arcs across many episodes. But not a lot externally - No high-concept stories, no epics, no world-changing story arcs.  Johann might spend a season stealing Karen's inheritance, but they'd never spend a season helping the CIA catch Iranian spies. Some series may have higher production values (Dallas being an archetypal example). The distinction you're looking for is that many people say that if you increase the production values, it's still a ""soap"". Before Dallas, an expensive soap was unthinkable, but it opened the floodgates. So  what makes a soap is Soap: Gossip Girl, What/If, Pretty Little Liars, Revenge Non-Soap: Orphan Black, Man in the High Castle, Humans, Halt and Catch Fire"
"Did John McClane know Bill Clay was really Hans Gruber? If so, how?","Those two scenes go like this: (Hans jumps down from an inspection and ends up crouched at John's feet.  With a gun pointing at his head, he pretends to be an hostage until John calms him down..)
John: What the fuck are you doing up here?  What were you looking for?
Hans:  I was ..trying to get up, on the roof and.. see if I could signal for help.  You know.. (looks back to where he'd stashed the gun)
It's just through here.  Why don't you come and help.
John: Hold it.  Forget the roof. 
(as Hans goes to pass through the passage between industrial units to retrieve the gun.
John swings the weapon around so it is again pointing at Hans)
John: I said forget the roof, they got people all over it.
Come on, you want to stay alive, stay with me.  
(Hans 'has a look' before scene breaks to FBI)
(Cuts back.  John takes out cigarette pack with 2 left)
John: You smoke?
Hans: (smiles) ..Yeah.  Thanks.
(John has one cig. in mouth as he passes the pack and remaining cigarette to Hans.
There is a directory board over Hans left shoulder, showing names and locations of employees.
John has has weapon pointed in Hans' general direction. Not directly at him, but not far off either.
Hans takes the last cigarette and slips the empty pack in his pocket as John pulls out a Zippo.)
Hans: You don't work for Nakatomi. And you're not one of them..
(John, now turned further away from Hans, smiles wryly)
John: I'm a cop from New York.
Hans: (Hans shows some surprise) ..from New York! (chuckles)
John: Yeah..  Got invited to the Christmas party by mistake.  Who knew?
(Hans chuckles, notices John's bare feet, John starts chuckling..)
John: Ehh.. Better than being caught with your pants down, huh? 
(Hans also chuckles, John glances at directory)
John: I'm John McClane.  You're uh..
Hans: (Hans looks blank for a moment)  Clay. (smiles) Bill.. Clay.
(John glances back at Directory and sees a Clay, W.M. from the 29th floor.  Nods to himself.)
John: Know how to use a hand gun, Bill?
Hans: I spent a weekend at a combat ranch. That game with the guns that shoot red paint. Probably seems stupid to you.
(John has been doing things with the hand gun, seems to put a clip in it and cock it.)
John:  Nope.  (John holds out gun, to Hans.)
Time for the real thing, Bill.
(Hans looks at the gun, looks at John, then slowly, reaches out to take it.)
John: All you got to do is pull the trigger.  Come on.  (Walks past Hans.)
(Hans drops his cigarette, stamps it out, and speaks into his radio..)
Hans: 33. Stockwerk.  Kommt sofort.
(He takes his time, aiming the gun at John as John walks slowly away, with a 'I knew it..' look on his face)
'click' (as he ..again, cocks the weapon)
(John takes out his cigarette and slowly turns back to face Hans.)
Hans: Put down the gun, and give me my detonators.
(John takes a drag on his cigarette)
John: Well, well, well.. Hans.
Hans: Put it down.  Now.
John: That's pretty tricky with that accent.  You oughta' be on fuckin' TV with that accent.  (Slowly walks back towards Hans)  But what do you want with the detonators Hans? I already used all of the explosives.  ..Or did I?
Hans: I'm going to count to three.
John: Yeah.  Like you did with Takagi?
(Hans pulls trigger)  'click'..
John: Oops.. ('click, click, click)
No bullets.  What do you think - I'm fuckin' stupid, Hans?
('bing' as elevator arrives)
Hans: (dripping with sarcasm) You were saying? Transcribing those two scenes as I was watching them again, I think that John was not fooled for a moment, but was trying to draw out as much information as he could from this chance hostage.  I don't think he at first realized it was Hans himself, but John knew all along that it was one of the gang members.  He was probably surprised that the leader would be forced to do his own 'trivial tasks' away from their main stronghold on the 30th floor. Note that most of the early time he has a gun pointed in Hans' general direction.  But he reaches a stage where he realizes he must convince 'Bill' that he himself is convinced of his story, so gives him the (unloaded) weapon. When John glanced at the directory and found the name, he was probably thinking something along the lines of: OK - this guy is no dummy - better be real careful with him. Allowing Hans to get on the radio indicates he was not quite careful enough, he'd gambled a bit too much in order to get more information, and it almost cost his life (for the umpteenth time that evening)."
Why didn't Hugo Weaving reprise his role as Red Skull?,"Maybe because he was not interested to do it. He was pretty clear about his opinion for future portrayal of the character from very start, from his 2012's interview from collider (emphasis mine): I [signed a multi-picture deal] for Captain America. I think the tendency, with those films, would be to probably not bring a villain back. They might for The Avengers, but I didn’t think I’d be in Captain America 2 or 3. I don’t think Red Skull will be there. And it’s not something I would want to do again. I’m glad I did it. I did sign up for a number of pictures and I suppose, contractually, I would be obliged to, if they forced me to, but they wouldn’t want to force someone to do it, if they didn’t want to. I think I’ve done my dash with that sort of film. It was good to do it and try it out, but to be honest, it’s not the sort of film I seek out and really am excited by. As an actor, to do all sorts of different films is great. It stretches you in different ways. But, I increasingly like to go back to what I used to always do, which is to get involved with projects that I really have a personal affiliation with. But no official words came for Avengers: Infinity War specifically yet."
What do I need to know before watching 3D for the first time,"Are 3D glasses needed? Yes. While not as bad as the early days of 3D where viewing without glasses meant red and blue headaches for days, the video will look slightly off. Note that many films have scenes, not the whole film in 3D, so you may still enjoy the experience overall. If so are they provided? Yes. I am not aware of any theater that doesn't provide glasses. The glasses will typically fit over prescription eyeglasses without modification. If they are provided would a better experience be had, by purchasing 3D glasses? You won't know until you try them--if you intend to make a habit of it it might be worthwhile, but you run the risk that the technology used for the effect will change and you will have to repurchase your glasses. So I am I clueless, what do I need to know before walking up to the counter and purchasing a ticket to a 3D movie? You may experience eye strain and motion sickness, and possibly discomfort due to poorly fitting glasses. However it will be a novel experience, and hopefully as enjoyable as seeing a movie in 2D."
Did Spaceballs have to get permission for Pizza the Hutt,"A brand like Pizza Hut can be trademarked but not copyrighted. Copyrights allow the author (or owner of the copyright) to retain exclusive rights to use the work or significant portions of it. Trademarks do not work that way. Trademarks are meant to provide legal recourse when a business uses the same or similar name, logo, design, catchphrase, etc., as another business in a way that competes with or damages the reputation of the business that holds the trademark. Words, phrases, logos, symbols, and designs can be trademarked. Like copyrights, authors of such works are protected whether or not their trademark is registered, but registration makes legal protection much easier. The producers of Spaceballs did not have to clear the character name of Pizza the Hutt before they released the movie, but they probably did it just in case. Two likely reasons why Pizza Hut would have allowed it are: Note that in Spaceballs there is also a Mr. Coffee coffee machine of the future that makes coffee described as ""too hot"" by a character, which is closer to damage (IMHO) than the character of Pizza the Hutt. Interestingly enough, since Spaceballs is a copyrighted work, if Pizza Hut created a television advertisement showing footage of Pizza the Hutt from Spaceballs, they would have to get permission to do so from the company that owns the copyrights to the movie. Also note that exactly what constitutes ""damage"" or infringement in general in a legal sense is determined in the courts, not spelled out explicitly in the law. Legal precedence set by previous court cases is usually, but not always, followed by judges, but generally legal teams prefer to clear everything before a movie is released, because going through that process is a lot less expensive than even a successful defense in a court case. One interesting and educational example of a real-world trademark dispute is the case of Apple Corps vs. Apple Computer. The companies had the same name (more or less), but in the original case, since one company made and sold computers and the other company made and sold records, it was decided that there was no trademark infringement. But Apple Computer was specifically enjoined to not get into the music business. Of course it went back to trial a few times over the subsequent years, such as when the iTunes Music Store was created.  Source: https://www.upcounsel.com/what-does-a-trademark-protect "

Was film actually “better” than digital media?,"I'm going to start an answer but this is by no means complete. Whether you're talking about film as a recording medium or as a presentation format, there are people who prefer both. You can do a lot of research on why one is better than the other but a lot of it comes down to personal preference in the end. There are pros and cons for film and for digital. Some directors are sticklers for using film, particularly for quality/stylistic reasons, while others like the freedom allowed with digital media. Here are just a few of the major differences. Dynamic range - or How pretty will it be? You're going to get better whites and blacks and colors with film than with digital. The digital sensors just aren't quite sensitive enough (yet) to mimic film: There is no limit to the number of possible levels of color on emulsion film, whereas a digital sensor stores integer numbers, producing a limited and specific possible number of colors. Banding may be visible in the unusual case that it is not obscured by noise, and detail may be lost, particularly in shadow and highlight areas. Here's an article comparing digital and film stills to show the dynamic range differences between the two... it's pretty impressive. Here's a summary statement on the site: It's 2014 and when I shoot digital, I'm still using a cheap one for most things.  That's because in late 2014, even the expensive ones still blow out highlights in a nasty, computerized, unacceptable-looking way. Full-frame digital gives slightly more leeway, but it's still not slide film. At least when highlights get blown out with film, they look natural.  As we've seen, Fuji Superia negative film was able to tolerate seven full stops of highlight overexposure and still yield a pleasant, smooth-looking picture.   It could be ten or twenty stops overexposed, and the worst that would happen is that it would yield a smooth-edged transition to pure white. As to your basic question, this is the immediate answer... none of the other factors listed below are important to directors who care about this one. Film was (and is) still better in a quantifiable way, than digital. Everything below here is why so many opt to forgo what some consider a very minor difference between the two and make the switch to digital: Cost - or How much do I have to fork over? Film is expensive. With film projects, a major cost of making is the cost of film stock (around $769 USD/roll), processing, digitizing (so that it can be edited digitally), preserving, and storing the film negatives. And, with the increasing use of digital, these costs are likely rising as fewer film-processing companies are around...  If you're interested in the costs, there's a site that outlines some of them here, not sure how recent the info is. That isn't to say that digital doesn't have costs of its own... Camera cards, storage media, etc ... do have expenses associated with them. Ease of Loss - or How much can I screw up and still get a movie out of it? I'm not going to say that it's impossible to screw up or lose digital files... it is... but it's not nearly as easy as screwing up a roll of undeveloped film. One little light leak and the last two hours of work is down the drain. With film, you have to train people how to properly load and unload film rolls and to particularly be wary of any light... and you have to protect those shot and un-shot rolls from the moment you buy them until they've been finished processing. Even only taking into account the time from when shot to developed and digitized, it can be a day or two... or a week before the film is truly ""safe""... and this often requires mailing or couriering it across several states depending on if there's a processing house anywhere nearby. With digital, when you pop the card out of the camera it goes to your data wrangler who will download the data and likely make multiple copies of it and verify that the files are good. Within an hour, your data is ""safe"". If you're smart and do make multiple copies of the data and keep them in different places, the chance you'll lose everything is miniscule. Reviewing Shots - or How quickly can I see the mess the actors made of my dialogue? As stated above, you don't know what you've got on film until it's developed... which can take a day to a week. Some sets may do a simultaneous recording on a digital camera but it may not record an identical image to the 35mm camera. Digital media can be instantly reviewed by simply watching the digital files on the camera. Length of Shots - or How often do I have to stop and change my media? A standard roll of film has a run time of about 11 minutes when run at 24 frames per second... regardless of the type of film, actually. It's the same running time for 35 mm and 16 mm, just smaller (shorter) rolls for the 16 mm. Note, this also means you have to change rolls of film every 11 minutes of shooting time! Depending on the digital camera used, recording quality and the size of the memory cards, you can get much more time on a digital camera.  Here's some info from the Arri Alexa's recording info page:  To paraphrase, with a 64 GB card, you'll get between 24 and 210 minutes of recording time depending on the codec you use. There are other differences, obviously, but these are the big ones. The dynamic range issues exist here, too but the production companies have a bit more control and they're a bit more finicky about price. Here's some numbers from an undated article on the University of California Institute for Research in the Arts: Today, the driving force isn’t so much a single movie as it is the studios’ bottom line — they no longer want to pay to physically print and ship movies. It costs about $1,500 to print one copy of a movie on 35 mm film and ship it to theaters in its heavy metal canister. Multiply that by 4,000 copies — one for each movie on each screen in each multiplex around the country — and the numbers start to get ugly. By comparison, putting out a digital copy costs a mere $150. A similar amount is noted on the Wikipedia page about release prints. Release prints are generally expensive. For example, in the United States, it is not unusual for each one to cost around $1,500 to print and ship to theaters around the country. The cost of a release print is determined primarily by its length in feet, the type of print stock used and the number of prints being struck in a given run."
Why doesn't Marty use the other DeLorean?,"You do have a point in that the fuel could have been syphoned. However, it's more likely that there just wasn't any. When the doc gets back to 1885 with broken time circuits, he first tries to fix it. When he realizes it can't be fixed, he buries the car in the mine after first draining it of all fluids. While it is unclear if the car could be dug up, it wouldn't have had any fuel. The doc would have had to keep all fluids that he drained from the car. You could argue that some gasoline could always come in handy, but as the doc mentions in his letter, he is concerned about the space time continuum. Keeping it around in his shop would be dangerous (what if someone found it?) and he wasn't going to use it in a car as he specifically forbids Marty to rescue him. To avoid disrupting space-time, the simplest thing would have been to dispose of all fuel. The official explanation can be found here. Apparently the time paradox for going back into the mine was too dangerous too go back in. However, Doc could have still drained it and kept it in his shop. Either he didn't want to keep it around (for the danger of discovery) or he didn't see the point in keeping it."
Is this an inconsistency in the Infinity War and Guardians of the Galaxy?,"The destruction of the Zehoberei people may have come long after Thanos' attack on the planet. Gamora was only a little girl when it happened, and it doesn't appear that Thanos revisited her planet after the genocide. Edit: Thanos never says when he went back to her planet. Estimates put her age at 26 during IW, and she looks to be around 8-10 when Thanos kidnaps her. Even if we knock off a couple of years to account for GotG, an extremely conservative estimate puts the time range at 10 years between kidnap and IW. That's a long time for catastrophes to happen. I'm not saying Thanos' strategy killed her people. I'm saying that Thanos went back after he halved their population, observed that they were thriving, left, and then a catastrophe befell them that killed the entire population."
Why did Obi-Wan have to explain full details about Mos Eisley to Luke?,"There’s definitely exposition for the audience, but even in-world Obi-Wan is much more experienced than Luke is. Luke may know the place is a rough area, but “old Ben” who fought in the Clone Wars is basically telling him that it’s one of the toughest places he’s seen. It’s a warning on top of whatever rumors Luke may have heard. Or... it’s just commentary. People say unnecessary things all the time. It’s kind of human nature"
The most actors playing the same role in one movie?,"There's a wiki article on this too - List of characters played by multiple actors in the same film The highest film I can find that definitely meets the requirement is: Palindromes - eight actors playing one role: All of the below actors play Aviva Emani Sledge, Valerie Shusterov, Hannah Freiman, Rachel Corr, Will

  in Audition (2015) To quote from the IMDB article on Audition: A romance is portrayed by one hundred actors who audition for the two
  lead roles and the chance to perform the final terrifying act. What is love? New York filmmaker Matt Herron spent over 15 years
  peeling back layers of expectations and disappointments to explore the
  mysteries of this complex emotion through his powerful new film,
  AUDITION. Set in the midst of a real-life acting competition, this
  cautionary narrative within a documentary is a sensually-riveting
  journey every adult should see. So technically all of these people are playing the same role - that of the ""man"" or that of the ""woman"". If you check the film's credits, they are all credited as so, and as the OP asked Which movie-character was played by the most amount of distinct actors in a single movie?, this does meet the requirements."
"Who is the titular ""Last Jedi""?","Though, the title itself is quite ambiguous, but we can go through the movie plot and conclude it. Princess Leia is sensitive to the Force, but she is not a Jedi. She didn't get training as Jedi. Kylo Ren was trained as Jedi, but he was seduced by the dark side of the Force, so he is not a Jedi. Rey was just learning the ways of the Force, but wasn't under actual Jedi training. She might be a Jedi in future, but it's speculation for now. When master Yoda died in Return of the Jedi, Luke was the last Jedi left. Here is the conversation between Yoda and Luke. Yoda:  Luke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor, or suffer your father's fate, you will. Luke, when gone am I (cough), the last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned, Luke... (with great effort)   There is...another...Sky...Sky...walker. When Kylo Ren fights with Luke near the end of The Last Jedi, they have following conversation, Kylo Ren: And when I kill you, I will have killed the last Jedi. Luke Skywalker: Amazing. Every word of what you just said... was wrong. The Rebellion is reborn today. The war... is just beginning. And I will not be the last Jedi. And the opening crawls of The Force Awakens says, Luke Skywalker has vanished.
  In his absence, the sinister
  FIRST ORDER has risen from
  the ashes of the Empire
  and will not rest until
  Skywalker, the last Jedi,
  has been destroyed. So, it is clear that the title is referring to Luke."
Why did Lord Baelish betray Eddard Stark?,"Petyr Baelish wants one thing: power. He is the son of a very minor lord with very poor holdings. He grew up seeing the love of his life get married to someone else with a more powerful family name. He knows that he can never actually rule in name, but he wants to be at least the real power behind the throne. For that to happen he needs to setup a puppet king that he can control.  So Lord Baelish's plan was to back Joffrey's claim to the throne and isolate him from his mother (and the Lannisters) with Lord Stark serving as Joffrey's regent since he is under-aged. In return for this he expected to become Lord Stark's right hand man, giving him a great amount of power especially given Stark's limited political skills. But Lord Stark had other ideas. He wanted to expose Joffrey's parentage and install Stannis Baratheon and the new king of Westeros. Lord Baelish knew Stannis very well from serving with him in the Small Council. Stannis is a humorless man who had no patience for his scheming and was someone he could not easily manipulate, thus costing him a great amount of power and influence. This was, to him, unacceptable. So Lord Baelish sided with the Lannisters and helped them foil Stark's plan. Now he has the trust of the Lannisters with all the influence that gives him. The Lannisters are nothing if not generous to those loyal to them, and through further services to the Lannisters he is awarded with the lordship of Harrenhal."
How did Alan Turing break the Enigma code using the hint given by the lady in the bar?,"The actual decryption was very complex but Bletchley Park was given a BIG clue because... To aid this process, all Turing needed was a word (or a group of words) that he was positive the Germans would use in each of their Enigma-encrypted messages.

"Why does Mike call Jimmy ""Saul""?","I disagree that Mike isn't the sort of person who would entertain a name change like this.  Mike is exactly the sort of person who would hear ""I've changed my name to Saul"" and shrug it off with a casual ""Whatever,"" and then proceed to call him only Saul from then on. Mike is the kind of guy who does the job he's asked to do and doesn't ask any questions that he doesn't need the answers to.  As long as you play it straight, he will too. Refusing to call Jimmy ""Saul"" would potentially disrupt any shady dealings they were involved in together, if third parties only knew the name Saul.  It would also be an indiscretion to casually blow Saul's cover by calling him Jimmy just because Mike knows his real name.  Of all the characters seen in either show, Mike is the most discreet and conscientious of the sensitive nature of the illegal operations these people so often find themselves embroiled in. Unless he had a good reason NOT to call Jimmy ""Saul,"" I believe he would do so without batting an eyelash."
How was 1917 filmed as a continuous shot?,"Quoting from Wikipedia under filming section. Filming was accomplished with long takes and elaborately choreographed moving camera shots to give the effect of one continuous take. Careful editing was employed to trick the viewer’s eye into thinking they were watching films unfolding in one unbroken take. (source) Sam Mendes explained it quite well himself in behind the scenes of 1917. This one explains too. As explained in a screenrant article: Anytime something fills the screen, such as soldiers walking in front of the camera and occupying the entire frame for a split second, a cut can be hidden."
Why do the toys blink alternately?,"A theory: Most of the characters in Toy Story blink their eyes one at a time.
  This is called ""offset blinking"" and is usually used in animation to
  signal an out of place or stupid character. In Toy Story, it's
  likely used to remind the audience the toys are still toys. Pixar has
  continued using the offset blink in other films."

Is the Three-Eyed Raven incapable of emotion?,"From the mouth of the actor in charge of playing the current Three-Eyed Raven, Isaac Hempstead-Wright: ""He's got this wealth of important information that really needs to get to the right people. And so by the start of season seven, Bran is in many ways a very different character,"" Hempstead Wright said. ""He's the Three-Eyed Raven — he's not Bran Stark, which means he's really just a vehicle for the greater world's fate. That is what Bran's destiny is and what he's doing in season seven.""
— Isaac Hempstead-Wright, INSIDER and ""Bran is existing in thousands of planes of existence at any one time. So it’s quite difficult for Bran to have any kind of semblance of personality anymore because he’s really like a giant computer.""
— Isaac Hempstead-Wright, Entertainment Weekly Essentially: being in all places at once, throughout time (past, present and potential future) has been a gift and a curse for Bran, as he is no longer the Bran Stark we knew before, even though he says himself that he remembers what it was like to be Bran Stark, a boy from Winterfell, scattering your mind to bear witness to every event ever in the world, as well as being given the burden of the responsibility of seeing the world through the peril of the Night King, seems to have this extreme and literal greater-goal effect on his character. He repeatedly confirms what the actor has also clarified: he is no longer Bran Stark. His apparent apathy and emotionlessness are a consequence of not having the same perspective that normal people have. We see Meera saying, ""My brother died for you"", having no effect on Bran because he has watched hundreds of thousands of deaths and births and horrific events, he has a completely shifted perspective, almost god-like, on the relatively smaller events or interactions, due to his omniscience. Since I first wrote this answer, an official HBO interview with actor Isaac Hempstead-Wright, over at the official behind the scenes blog, Making Game of Thrones, has come out, further confirming what has been said, as well as adding some more insight: HBO: Do you agree with Meera’s assessment that Bran died in the cave back in Season 6? Isaac Hempstead Wright: It’s quite a bold thing for Meera to have said. Sadly, I think in many ways she was right. It’s just this whole idea that Bran has become a much smaller part of the character’s brain, when before 100 percent of his head was taken up with being Bran Stark. Now, that’s just one tiny file in a huge system. But certainly, he’s almost completely a different character. He acts utterly differently, and really any semblance of personality he used to have has gone. HBO: Is there anything left of the old Bran? Isaac Hempstead Wright: In Episode 4 [“The Spoils of War”] he says, “I remember what it felt like to be Brandon Stark, but I remember so much else now,” which sums up exactly the situation Bran is in. There is a flicker of Bran left in him, but really, can you imagine putting the entire history of the universe, every single moment, every single second that ever existed in one person’s brain? You’d think it would just short circuit. Bran just becomes this calm, zen character. He’s really like a human supercomputer. HBO: How challenging was it to essentially take on that new character while still maintaining the fact that you are in some small way Bran? Isaac Hempstead Wright: It was definitely difficult to get it right. I had a meeting with [series creators] David [Benioff] and Dan [Weiss], and they wanted him to be quite monotone and agenda-less, but at the same time have a slight flair, so it wasn’t just like listening to a robot talk. There had to be a sense of mystery and wisdom to him. He was sort of inspired by Dr. Manhattan in The Watchmen series — being in all these places at once, in all these time zones at once. I tried to base it on the old Three-Eyed Raven [played by Max von Sydow in Season 6] and have a sense of this wise, old, man sitting in a tree. At the same time, still have that slight spark somewhere in there where you know this is Bran Stark. It was a fine balance. —""Isaac Hempstead Wright on the 'Fine Balance' of Playing Bran"", Making of Game of Thrones"
How can weightlessness be simulated on film?,"One of the known method for this is Reduced gravity aircraft, unofficial nickname vomit comet. KC-135A known as NASA 930 was used in the movie Apollo 13. Cecil said that in 2001: A Space Odyssey, huge rotating sets are used, while the actor remained more or less stationary. It's not that realistic in looks but cheaper as compare to vomit comet. Wire and green screen combination are also used sometimes."
Why did they pick World War I over World War II in Wonder Woman?,"Producer Charles Roven felt that WW I held special meaning for Diana. Amazons are skilled in hand to hand combats. They are also used to the fact that fight is an honorable thing. But all of this was changed in World War I when automated arms were introduced and the armies were fighting with guns, bombs, rifles etc. It was no longer what would he call honorable. Therefore, he wanted that culture shock. Which is why, he chose World War I. Here is an excerpt of his interview given to IGN(emphasis mine), IGN: The decision to set Wonder Woman’s solo film in World War I is very interesting. It's not a time period we've seen a heck of a lot of in movies these days. Can you talk a bit about that decision? Charles Roven: One of the reasons that we picked World War I was we felt that it [worked] in terms of that war and what it meant to Diana. Diana was raised on Themyscira with the lore, the history of the Amazons, and the Amazons, you know from the canon and the New 52, were created to be inspirations towards mankind. And [they] helped promote peace and goodwill amongst men and mankind. But at some point, they were enslaved by mankind and they had to break their shackles, which is why they wear the bracelets, as symbols of that. And they were given Themyscira by Zeus. But they're always training and they're warriors, and there's great pride to their abilities, their fighting abilities, etc. And even though they haven't had any war on Themyscira, they're used to fighting being an honorable thing. They're used to one on one combat, or even if it's armies fighting each other, ultimately that great legacy of fighting hand to hand. The best warrior wins. There's a lot of contact, and World War I was the first war where that changed, where it became more remote. You were killing people -- whether it was through guns, through rifles, through mortars, through bombs, through gas attacks -- that you didn't even know, that you never looked into their eyes. And it ceased to be what I would call an “honorable war.” And so we wanted that culture shock. And those images of no man's land and the trenches and fighting for years against an enemy that you really don't see, who's a hundred, two hundred yards next to you, but you never see their face, we just wanted those images in the movie because we thought that it would be very, very symbolic to her."
"Why does Archer say ""Balls"" whenever someone says ""Benoit""?","Benoit is a French name pronounced like Ben Wa.

"Where are Frodo, Gandalf and the others going at the end and why?","Frodo leaves Middle-earth for the Undying Lands with Gandalf, Bilbo, Elrond, Celeborn, and Galadriel. This is considered a mystical land, home to the Valar, 'angelic' beings, also known as the 'masters of spirits'. From the LotR wiki:  In TA 3021 (Third Age), Círdan the Shipwright accompanied Elrond, Galadriel, and Gandalf, the Keepers of the Rings, on a voyage to the Undying Lands, where they intended to remain. They were also joined by Frodo and Bilbo Baggins, Hobbits who were among the very few mortal beings to be allowed passage to the Undying Lands.
  Eventually, Samwise Gamgee, another Hobbit of the Shire, and the Dwarf Gimli along with his good friend Legolas, are also said to have made the journey. Now, as to why they made the journey, there seems to only be speculation, although the most common agreement is that Tolkien chose to have his beloved characters travel there, seemingly to remain, in order for them to live forever. EDIT: It has been pointed out that, as mortals, eternal life would not be an option for the hobbits, so perhaps we should consider it more of a happy retirement. Another, more thorough, answer could be the following, from Yahoo: His [Frodo's] journey to Mordor had scarred him, physically and emotionally. He would never fully heal. Arwen gave him her seat on the last ship (the only thing of note she ever did in the whole danged book) so that he could find rest. All of the ring bearers left Middle-earth; Gandalf, Galadriel, Elrond, Bilbo, Frodo, and even Sam after his children were grown and Rosie passed away."
Thanos And the Time Stone,"Can't Thanos do the exact same thing, now? For all we know, if Dr. Strange would have continued his search through the future, then, he could have discovered another couple, or even couple hundred, different paths that lead to beating Thanos. Conversely, it's also possible that he'd never discover another single one.. Similarly, if Thanos were to look into the future, then, it's easily possible that he might not discover a future that leads to his doom until his 4 billionth trace of the future; maybe even 4 trillionth! Given that there are literally an infinite number of ""branches"" that occur when searching through the future, really, Dr. Strange was extremely lucky to find a winning future in just 14 million searches. At the same time, perhaps Thanos just doesn't have a motivation to do such a thing -- he's just obtained the six most powerful objects in the universe, is now the most powerful being himself, and, has just accomplished his ultimate goal. My point is that is can Thanos override Dr. Strange's ""Future""? This kind of topic usually invokes paradoxical arguments, etc., so I won't get into all that, but, in general, perhaps some futures can't be changed, regardless of a character's efforts to avoid it? A classic example of this kind of story (where the character is aware of their future, makes an active attempt to avoid it, but by doing so actually fulfills their destiny) is the Greek tragedy of Oedipus Rex."
Why do movie directors use brown tint on Mexico cities?,"From the trivia page on imdb for Traffic: To achieve a distinctive look for each different vignette in the story, Steven Soderbergh used three different film stocks (and post-production techniques), each with their own color treatment and grain for the print. The ""Wakefield"" story features a colder, bluer tone to match the sad, depressive emotion. The ""Ayala"" story is bright, shiny, and saturated in primary colors, especially red, to match the glitzy surface of Helena's life. The ""Mexican"" story appears grainy, rough, and hot to go with the rugged Mexican landscape and congested cities.  Film processing (or digital processing filters) is often used in films to convey mood/heat/other emotions.  This is all that's in play here. Mexico is often viewed as being hot and claustrophobic - the film treatment here (and in other films) uses this to enhance the mood of the film. Additionally, Soderbergh's rationale for differing colour temperatures and grain effects in different strands of the story of ""Traffic"" can easily to be applied to other directors and films.  Directors can and do use film treatments, editing styles, and music in order to enhance the emotional impacts of scenes, characters, events, and entire films. It's outside the scope of this answer to include exhaustive examples.  However, the main point of this answer is that directors aren't likely to apply film treatements in order to convey a stereotypical perception of any particular location, although this may occasionally be the case."
Why do the kicks have to occur simultaneously?,"I love the question.
Here's a summary from a very tight explanation (with some drawings): Inception and Kicks There were two types of dreams. The simple construct with a mild sedative and the more complex construct with a strong sedative. In the simple construct, one kick is enough. Kick can be either to the self (eg: Arthur shot in the head) or a kick from above (eg: Cobb dunked in bath tub). The sedative is light so there is no synchronization required. In real life this can be equated to sleeping and dreaming about falling, the fall in the dream wakes us up. Alternately someone wakes you up by pushing you off the bed. In a strong sedative, complex construct dream - a single kick is not going to be enough. A person needs two synchronized at the same instant. One kick to the self and one from the level above. The synchronization is done using music. In the real world, this can be equated to being under total anesthesia. Neither would a bad dream fall wake you up nor would pushing you off the operating table. The reel part here is that if some how pushing you off the table can be coincided with the fall in your dream, you can wake up. Now, in the act of inception on Fischer's mind, they are in a complex heavily sedated dream. The only viable kick here is falling because death will take you to limbo. As mentioned in another answer, waiting it out is not going to work because weeks and months would need to pass in the lower layers. Waiting it out is a possible option only in the first layer because there is limited time dilation. Also a single kick from a level above or jumping off a cliff in the current level wont work as a kick. The dreamer is far too sedated for that. A person needs to fall in the current level and the level above simultaneously so so they plan. The following kicks (falls) are planned: Level 1 : Van Falling
Level 2 : Falling by one floor (blowing up the floor)
Level 3 (inception level) : Falling from the building (blowing up the structure) Of course, things don't go as plan. Hence they improvise on the kicks.
Here is the set of synchronized kicks that each one receives per level of dream.
Point to note, no two people receive the same two kick pairs. Here's the image from the link:

(source: thisisbarry.com) So, other than dying in limbo, everything else needs a pair of synchronized kicks. For more details, read the link."
What media format do TV stations use?,"TL;DR While it varies from station to station, it is common to receive or ingest the footage by receiving on satellite and recording it for later usage. Where possible, the TV station will accept the media files from the production house or a distribution service directly. In this case, the media is usually in the MXF or MOV file formats. The resolution is usually 1280x720 or 1920x1080, with a higher bit-rate ranging between 30 and 100 Mbps. The only major difference between the consumer deliverable and the format the station has is the bit-rate. The TV station has equipment that can handle the larger files, and has a larger data storage capacity than most normal households. However, a well encoded Blu-ray will contain a close copy of the file the station receives, with an encoded bit-rate between 15 and 45 Mbps. The main reason for the difference is bandwidth. One 24 minute episode at a bit rate of 145 Mbps stored in uncompressed MXF can be as large as 29 GB. Unfortunately, that has to be compressed in order to get it out to the millions of people that TV stations service. There isn't an established format that all TV stations receive. It largely depends on the format that can be provided to the station, and what the station is setup to accept regarding equipment. As Scotty Parker mentioned, a lot of the content is ingested into the studio via satellite. meaning, it's simply recorded as it's airing, like a fancy DVR and a dish that's bigger than average. When this is the case, the recorded format is usually as high as it can be, which is hopefully in most cases HD at 1280x720, or FHD at 1920x1080. However, an increasingly large number of stations use content that is acquired directly from the production house. Meaning that the company who produced and/or edited the show will provide the media directly to the station airing it. In many cases this is a very high bit-rate, high resolution file. Something akin to Avid's DNxHD format (such as DNxHD145 or 175), or Apple ProRes, or Sony's XDCAM. But despite the higher-than-average bitrate of the file, the resolution is rarely anything higher than 1080p. Unless you're the editor, and you'd be working with a 1080p file at a bit-rate of 145 or 175 Mbps. But these formats are not secret, or kept from the general public. You can have the same formats TV stations use. For example: File based workflows (where the production house turns over the raw media directly), the file would most likely be in the MOV or MXF formats. These files are normally encoded at a bit rate of somewhere between 30 and 50 Mbps (hopefully), and a have resolution between 720 and 1080. Neither of these file types are hard to come by, and in fact, the MXF file type is listed as a SMPTE standard (SMPTE 377M). But how convenient would it be to sell you a show and make you download a 28GB file or a 32GB USB drive with a single episode of Game of Thrones?  So, it's made available to everybody in a compressed, but still very high quality format: Blu-ray. These Blu-ray's are normally encoded at a 15-30 Mbit bit-rate, which although less than the raw MXF, is still very high. Or you could download a slightly more compressed version from some website, or a streaming/OTT service (Apple TV, Netflix, etc). Source: I work at a TV station."
Why do the Avengers have bad radio discipline?,"Yes, as you provide evidence of, they have terrible radio discipline.  Trigger discipline too. Obviously this is due to the medium, movies and comics are verbal and the film makers need you to relate to human (ish) characters in a short amount of time. Sticking to radio silence and code names would make them too stiff to like. That said, only Cap, Wilson and maybe Barton fail in this respect.  They are the only traditional soldier types and would have radio discipline drilled into them. Then again. It's only really Wilson, as the rank and file soldier. Rogers spent most of his military career as a mascot capsicle, and the other half ignoring orders as a special agent. Nat is a spy, Thor is a loud boasting rage drunk, Lang a thief, Stark an egomaniac, etc. Notice that SHIELD agents do not have the same lack of discipline or screen time that would cinematically necessitate this informal kidding over comms. But to expand, there is more to it. The Avengers have the typical comic banter type of group dynamics. Contrast Cap in the serious missions during The First Avenger. Quick action scenes, and then his solo mission at the end. Widow uses talking as a weapon, to distract and throw off guard both foe and friend. It's part of her whole M.O., unassuming power house.  Contrast Fury who tries to keep them on target. Interestingly enough, the most disciplined is Hulk."
"Where does the ""One of us! One of us!"" chant originate?","Tod Browning's controversial cult horror film Freaks from 1932.

"Why does Jack Nicholson say ""Here's Johnny!"" in The Shining when his character is called Jack?","That line was ad-libbed by Jack Nicholson as an imitation of Ed McMahon's intro for The Tonight Show. From here: Jack Nicholson ad-libbed the line ""Here's Johnny!"" in imitation of
  announcer Ed McMahon's famous introduction of Johnny Carson on U.S.

What was up with Grand Maester Pycelle?,"Congratulations! It looks like you spotted a clue towards a plot twist originally planned to be revealed in Season 3, that was ultimately dropped. Pycelle was originally imagined by the showrunners (possibly by author GRRM too, it's unconfirmed as far as I know) as a meek careerist toady, someone who maintains his comfortable high-status position by being useful and loyal to those with power and by avoiding letting himself be seen as a threat. Part of that, as they saw it while writing at least the first 3 seasons, was that he deliberately acted more physically feeble than he really was, in a conscious attempt to appear harmless. They filmed a (later deleted) scene as part of filming Season 3, where Tywin calls Pycelle out on his act. 

 As soon as he realises he's been found out, Pycelle stands up straight, drops the stammer from his voice, and admits (rather awkwardly...) that his mannerisms were a phony ploy. It's an extreme transformation - he looks like a different man, suddenly almost as healthy and sturdy as Barristan. This scene never made the cut. I don't think they explicitly state why, but given that in Season 6...  ...he doesn't particularly stand up straight and fight even when being murdered to death by children. Maybe he lasts a little longer than you might expect for someone so seemingly frail, but he's quickly overwhelmed. ...it appears they changed their minds, or at least decided to tone down the contrast between how weak and frail he acts compared to how robust he really is. So it appears they'd anticipated this ""big reveal"" throughout the writing and filming of the first three seasons, peppering in various clues (some YouTube commenters also mention scenes in Season 2 after he's challenged by Tyrion, where he struggles vigorously, or briefly drops the stammer). Then, after filming this scene and reviewing it, for whatever reason, they changed their minds and dropped it. I'm not aware of any interviews where the writers discuss why this was dropped. Maybe they didn't like how the transformation looked compared to how they'd envisioned it; or maybe they felt that, compared to all the major ""this changes everything!"" moments in Season 3, revealing the character we all knew as a slimy, duplicitous toady to actually be a phony slimy, duplicitous toady wasn't quite the ""wow"" moment they'd hoped it would be."
How much does Joey owe Chandler?,"Based on a user over at Reddit, the amount comes upto $120,760 Source: https://www.dailydot.com/upstream/friends-how-much-does-joey-owe-chandler/ Amount breakdown: Now for food. ASmileThatKills tries to guesstimate the amount Joey, known for his love of eating, spends on food every week—or rather the amount Chandler spends covering him. ASmileThatKills speculates the total is ""$100 a week on groceries + $100 a week on pizza/takeout/coffee + $50 a week for Joey's dates, every week for 3 years."" So that’s $5,200 annually for groceries.  Joey went on a lot of dates, and this is Manhattan. Let's bump it up to $75, so $3,900 yearly. And since we all saw how much coffee those poor kids drank, let’s tack an extra $15/week onto the takeout total, or $5,980. That brings the three-year total for food costs up to $45,240. But wait, there's a lot more: But of course, this is all trivia and not the official amount disclosed.  And so as Joey says, ""it's a MOO point"" ;)"
Why is Pulp Fiction's opening scene different to the one near the end?,"It clearly looks like a continuity error, but if IMDb's Pulp Fiction FAQ page is to be believed: Why is what Yolanda says in the beginning different from what she says at the end? Tarantino has explained that this is not an error, rather, he did this on purpose. When we first examine the scene, we are seeing Ringo and Yolanda's conversation from their perspective. Obviously, because this is their conversation, what we hear first is probably what was actually said. However, at the end of the film, what is said is different because we are no longer viewing the situation from Ringo and Yolanda's perspective, but rather everyone else in the diner, most specifically Jules. So it is claimed that, in effect, this was done intentionally to further punctuate Pulp Fiction's disjointed, non-linear narrative with a Rashomon-inspired scene as presented from different perspectives (so it's simply remembered differently)."
Why did Jon Snow do this immoral act if he is so honorable?,"Jon did not commit to murdering Daenerys when he came to the Throne room.    The first thing he did was lash out at her about killing innocent civilians and prisoners of war. He had been a passive partner to Daenerys these last few episodes. He lashed out in anger because he wanted Daenerys to see reason. To snap her out of the cloud of smoke to see the rubble she had laid on ground.    The next thing he does is plead to her to see reason. To give mercy to Tyrion and the rest. Daenerys at this moment is now convinced that she knows what's right for the people.    The last thing he does is asks her plainly as to ""what about the people who think they know what's best for them"". She replies that they don't have a choice. After making every effort to redeem Daenerys in his eyes, he fails and decides to kill her. He loves her still and proclaims her the queen, now and always. Kisses her back, embrace her in his arms and stabs her in the heart."

What is the best order to watch LotR/Hobbit franchise?,"I would start with the Hobbit first. Some things that happen in the Hobbit franchise have no ""stakes"" if you watch the 3 LotR movies first. The Hobbit also gives back story for the main LotR story. There are risks that characters in the Hobbit take. If you watch the Lord of the Rings first, you'll know the outcome of the risks, and the tension in the Hobbit is reduced.  specifically Gandalf fighting a huge amount of Orcs in The Hobbit. Since he's in Lord of the Rings, if you see that first, when you watch The Hobbit you know that he wins the battle against the Orcs.  I found myself less invested in The Hobbit as a result. So I guess I should specify the order I recommend: The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"
What is this camera effect used in Hot Fuzz?,"The Michael Bay Spin I'm joking, but as far as I can tell the technique doesn't really have a name. All that's happening is that the camera is moving around subjects in the foreground, and the background appears to move quicker thanks to the simple fact that it's further away. The reason I refer to it as the Michael Bay Spin is that director Michael Bay has used this exact shot (with different actors/locations, of course) in a lot of his films. In fact, the inclusion of that shot in Hot Fuzz is a direct reference to Michael Bay - Bad Boys II (directed by Bay) is bought up earlier on in the film, and if I remember correctly, the shot in question is actually shown to the audience while Nicholas Angel and Danny watch the film at Danny's house."
Why does Christian Bale change his voice when playing Batman,"Well, most people often forget how easy it is to recognize somebody by voice and Bruce Wayne is kind of a celebrity.

Why does Dr Mann act so stupidly?,"The short answer is that Mann isn't a highly trained astronaut, he's a ground-based theoretical physicist who volunteered to lead this last-ditch mission. His knowledge of space flight is limited to a single mission and his training was done on the cheap by flight controllers who themselves haven't ever been into space.  It's clear that he doesn't recognise the danger. He ignores Coop's verbal warning as well as the master alarm, something a real astronaut would never ever do. On top of that, he seems to be displaying major symptoms of mental illness; paranoia, psychosis and disassociation, all things that would be likely to lead to impaired judgement.  "

"Why is the movie title ""Blazing Saddles""?","From IMDBs trivia page about the movie In the DVD commentary, Mel Brooks said that the working title for the film was ""Tex X"", as a reference to black Muslim leader Malcolm X. It was then switched to ""Black Bart"", then to ""The Purple Sage"". In either case, neither he nor the other writers thought those were great titles. Brooks says that one morning he was taking a shower and the words ""Blazing Saddles"" suddenly popped into his head. When he got out of the shower, he pitched the title to his wife, actress Anne Bancroft, who liked the idea, and that's how the movie ended up with its title."
How did Murph know about Edmunds?,The only way Murph could know is when that information came from Brand herself. Therefore we must assume that the quantum data Cooper send to Earth/Murph was also able to fix the one-directional communication problem through the worm hole.
Why did Spider-Man take a detour to Dorset?,"This is most likely a goof or an overlooked detail. The only source on Google that mentions ""spiderman far from home dorset"" is IMDB, and here's what they have to say, When the Stark Jet enters the UK, the caption states the Dorset coastline. Flying from Amsterdam to London you would cross the eastern coast of England, entering over the coast of Essex but the Dorset Chalk Cliffs are on the South West coastline which is 160 miles away.  Spider-Man: Far from Home (2019) Goofs I strongly doubt there's anything more to it because of how tiny a detail it is."
Why do some movies start with a big rotating circle and countdown?,"What you're talking about is a Film Leader.  Originally, a frame was inserted once every 16 frames (16 frames per foot for 35mm film) with numbers marked 11 to 3.  At some point in the mid 1960's that was changed to a continuous countdown with a new number every second (time interval as opposed to length interval) that ran backwards from 8 to 2.  If you google ""Film Leader Countdown"", you should be able to find a number of examples on YouTube and Vimeo. The purpose of this was to assist in the threading of projectors. The woman you speak of is referred to as a ""China Girl"".  That image is used to calibrate the film color when it's being processed."
Why is it Pet Sematary but not Pet Cemetery?,"Pet Sematary is based on the novel of the same name. The name is described by the elderly neighbor, Jud. He explains that it was created by the children of the neighborhood to bury their dead animals killed on the heavily travelled road. The children had misspelled the name when it was created. Quoting the Stephen King novel: ...It narrowed, and then, just ahead, Louis saw Ellie and Jud go under an arch made of weatherstained boards. Written on these in faded black paint, only just legible, were the words PET SEMATARY."
Was Tim's reaction to the electric fence realistic?,"It follows the standard film trope of electric shock - a bright spark, smoke, and the character blown backwards by an ""invisible hand"".  It also assumes mere contact with the electric cable is required, not considering the circuit as a whole.  And finally it assumes CPR will work miracles afterwards.  None of these are correct. 1) Electric sparks do not look at all like that, for starters.  Anyone who's jump-started a car knows what sparks look like.  The film version is pretty, but simply incorrect. 2) Smoke is rarely a feature of electric shocks.  In order for smoke to occur, something needs to have burned.  If that had happened to Timmy, he would have a continuous burn path through his body following the path of the current.  This would be clearly visible at post-mortem.  And he would very much be ""mortem"", because this would have been a large amount of current. This relates to comments on the other answer - electric fences are intended to be painful but not fatal.  The saying in the elec-eng world is ""it's the volts that jolts, but the mills (milliamps) that kills"".  If it has to be more powerful to get through dinosaur skin, the voltage can be increased substantially, but the current must not be, otherwise you'll have dead dinosaurs.  Electric fences do not appear threatening, so animals need to touch them at least once to discover that they are painful and learn to stay away from them. 3) An electric shock will certainly cause all your muscles to spasm, which can result in a substantial jump.  I've experienced that myself.  What you do not get is the effect shown in the film, where the electric shock acts like a piston hitting Timmy in the chest.  Arms may straighten outwards, but legs straighten upwards. 4) As everyone knows from seeing birds perched on high-voltage wires, what is required for an electric shock is a path for the electricity.  If there's no circuit, there's no current and hence no shock.  (On transmission cables, the resistance of the wire can give enough voltage at high current for a shock at human arm spacing, which is why linemen need extra protection, but these are not high-current transmission cables.)  Timmy would be in trouble when he touched the ground, but on the fence he's fine. Unless the people who made the fence have been sneaky and rigged each wire at a different voltage, for example using a three-phase supply with the wires alternating phases.  Touching adjacent or next-adjacent wires, as Timmy is doing, would then give you a shock too.  This has a separate problem though, which is that the foliage in contact with the fence is shown sparking, meaning it is conducting electricity.  As anyone familiar with Ohm's Law knows, this means a proportion of the current is going through the foliage instead of Timmy.  Extrapolate for the amount of foliage on this short section of fence, and you can expect Timmy to experience no shock whatsoever. 5) If Timmy has been shocked and his heart has stopped though, CPR almost certainly won't do anything except keep his body ticking over for a bit.  That's why we have defibrillators, because hearts are very reluctant to restart on their own.  It certainly isn't the magic that films show it as.  And moreover, if Timmy's had an adult pounding on his chest, he's going to hurt.  CPR regularly breaks ribs and tears chest muscles, because essentially you're delivering a powerful sternum punch with high follow-through, over and over again."
Why are two of Riley's five emotions in Inside Out male?,"Director Pete Docter and Pixar founder John Lasseter explain why Riley's emotions are mixed while her parents' are not. First, the parents' emotions are due to both emotional development and story and acting flow: I [Docter] remember, we talked to John and he said, ‘Well, I thought you did it because, as adults, we become more kind of set in our ways. As a kid, you can... anywhere is possible.’ Docter said that they were ultimately two things that were absolutely vital to the scene: clarity and comedy. Had Riley’s parents both had multi-gendered emotions like their daughter, the scene would have been going back between 18 different characters, and it was a bit unruly unless everyone was identifiable. Not only did making the emotions gender specific in the parents make the sequence easier to follow, but it also opened up an opportunity to create a few extra laughs.  Explained the director: 
For the comedy of it, we’re cutting between 18 characters and 4 locations in that dinner scene, so we just went broad with it - kind of how SNL would do it. They all have like dopey obvious mustaches or big red glasses so that you’re instantly clear on, ‘Oh, it’s mom; it’s dad.’ http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Why-Inside-Out-Main-Character-Has-Male-Female-Emotions-72176.html So the parents are simplified to make the scene easier to follow, and because as Adults, they have already developed their adult personality/emotions. Riley has not yet. Interviewer: What was the thought process behind the genders of the emotions?
Docter: Again, it was intuitive. It felt to me like Anger's very masculine, I don't know why. And then some of it came to casting... Sadness felt a little more feminine and Mindy Kahling as Disgust felt right. And someone balanced too. Plus the female roles lead because it's inside a girl. With mom and dad, we skewed them all male and all female for a quick read, because you have to understand where we are, which is a little phony but hopefully people don't mind! http://www.empireonline.com/empireblogs/empire-states/post/p1463 So in short, Riley's emotions are mixed because, as a pre-teen, she's likely not to have developed a strict outer personality. She's still growing, and developing her own style. She's still raw and malleable, impressionable. Secondary to this is of course the rule of funny. Having some of the emotions as male is purely for show."
How much of Star Wars did George Lucas actually write?,"At the risk of giving an opinion-based answer, your friend is mostly right. Lucas began by writing a synopsis of the story in early 1973, then started working on a rough draft of a script the next year. Lucas' first draft was a mess: the story was confusing, far too long, and incredibly boring; the characters were terrible and bland; the dialogue was leaden and stilted; etc.  He eventually produced at least 6 versions of the script (first/rough draft, second draft, third draft, then 3 different versions of the fourth draft), and he had lots of help during the revision process. In Lucas' own words in an article from Mediascene Prevue #42, 1980: I think [I came up with the title The Star Wars before the story]. When I made the deal, I had to give it a name. I had been making notes, doing research over the years, but it wasn’t until I finished American Graffiti in ’73 that I actually started writing it. My original 14-page treatment didn’t bear much relationship to the final production, though. From a site on the development of Star Wars: [In the first synopsis,] the story was very confusing and the spelling was horrible, since Lucas had never learned proper spelling or punctuation.  His agent and lawyer were puzzled and did not understand the story, and it was actually due to the popularity of American Graffiti that they eventually managed to sell the film to Twentieth Century Fox—after it had been rejected by both United Artists and Universal Pictures. A rough [draft] was completed one year later in May 1974, and still carried the title The Star Wars. It was the first of four major drafts and several revised versions... When the screenplay draft was finished, however, Lucas still thought it was a mess. The Adventures of the Starkiller (Episode One): “The Star Wars” was the title of Lucas’s second draft which was delivered on January 28, 1975. This was a more character-driven story with more character development, which was important since Lucas wanted the film to make an emotional impact... He let his friends (among them director Francis Ford Coppola) read the scripts and tape-recorded their comments in order to get some advice. However, the suggestions from his wife Marcia (a film editor who later won an Oscar for Star Wars) were the ones he took most seriously, even though her criticism sometimes made him angry. The third [draft] which was finished on August 1, 1975 was called The Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Starkiller, and by this time, most of the plot was established. Lucas felt quite comfortable with his characters, but he still thought that the dialogue needed improvement, and was very concerned that his story might never make it to the silver screen. Lucas’s revised fourth draft was the one which was used when filming began in Tunisia on March 25, 1976. A slightly edited version of this draft, entitled Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope—From the Journal of the Whills, was published in 1979 as the official screenplay of the film (the final editing of that public version [of the fourth draft]—erroneously dated to January 15, 1976—was done after Star Wars went into production, probably after the film’s May 1977 release).  Lucas had consulted his co-writers from American Graffiti (Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz) to sharpen the dialogue, which he felt lacked humour and bounce, and although he rejected most of what they came up with, their new ideas gave Lucas renewed confidence in his work.  Regarding A New  Hope: Lucas later commented on the contributions of Huyck and Katz, in the book Star Wars: The Annotated Screenplays:   Dialogue has never been my strong point, and so I talked to Willard and Gloria and asked them to do a quick dialogue polish. I gave them the fourth draft of the script, and they just improved the dialogue where they felt they could make a contribution. Then I took their changes, and sometimes I rewrote some of their lines. Some of their dialogue of course changed again when we started shooting. Some of it survived; some of it didn’t. They did about thirty percent of the dialogue. The cast agreed with Lucas' assessment of his dialogue-related shortcomings.  Carrie Fisher, Mark Hammil, and others frequently teased Lucas about this, and it is touched upon in audio commentary tracks and making-of documentaries. Harrison Ford was particularly outspoken, and his difficulties with Lucas' dialogue led him to improvise many of his lines in the series. Ford famously told George Lucas, concerning the clunky dialogue in ""Star Wars,"" ""George, you can type this shit, but you sure as hell can't say it.""  Harrison Ford later confirmed this: ""I told George: 'You can't say that stuff. You can only type it.'"" Regarding Ford's improvisation: Mark Hamill, for one, was amazed at the dedication Ford put into each and every line, stating, ""He'd written things in the margins, saying the same thing basically, but his way. He had an amazing way of keeping the meaning but doing it in a really unique way for his character.""  A George Lucas quote from Denise Worrell’s book Icons (1989):  There are four or five scripts for Star Wars, and you can see as you flip through them where certain ideas germinated and how the story developed. There was never a script completed that had the entire story as it exists now. But by the time I finished the first Star Wars, the basic ideas and plots for Empire and Jedi were also done. As the stories unfolded, I would take certain ideas and save them; I’d put them aside in notebooks. As I was writing Star Wars, I kept taking out all the good parts, and I just kept telling myself I would make other movies someday. It was a mind trip I laid on myself to get me through the script. I just kept taking out stuff, and finally with Star Wars I felt I had one little incident that introduced the characters. So for the last six years [1977-1983] I’ve been trying to get rid of all the ideas I generated and felt so bad about throwing out in the first place. Regarding Empire Strikes Back: George Lucas quote from Star Wars: The Annotated Screenplays:  Writing has never been something I have enjoyed, and so, ultimately, on the second film I hired Leigh Brackett. Unfortunately, it didn’t work out; she turned in the first draft, and then she passed away. I didn’t like the first script, but I gave Leigh credit because I liked her a lot. She was sick at the time she wrote the script, and she really tried her best. During the story conferences I had with Leigh, my thoughts weren’t fully formed and I felt that her script went in a completely different direction. A George Lucas quote from Alan Arnold’s book Once Upon A Galaxy I hired Leigh Brackett to write the screenplay, but tragically she died right after completing the first draft. Faced with the situation that somebody had to step in and do a rewrite, I was forced to write the second draft of this screenplay. But I found it much easier than I’d expected, almost enjoyable. It still took me three months to do, but that’s a lot different from two years. I also had the advantage of Larry Kasdan coming in later to do a rewrite and fix it up.   Lawrence Kasdan quote from Cinefantastique Vol. 28:  What I worked on was a draft of the script George had written, based on the story George had given to Leigh [Brackett]. I don’t know what of Leigh’s draft survived into the draft George wrote. What George handed me was a very rough first draft, really somewhere between an outline and a first draft. The structure of the story was all there – it was the skeleton for a movie. What was needed was the flesh and the muscle.”    Regarding Return of the Jedi (originally titled ""Return of the Jedi"" in early pre-production, retitled ""Revenge of the Jedi"" just before filming began, kept this title until 4 months before the film was released, when Lucas finally, officially changed the title back to ""Return of the Jedi""):   Lawrence Kasdan quote from Starlog #51 (October 1981):  [Kasdan is working from a] very rough first draft [script that George Lucas wrote. Kasdan will have to write Revenge of the Jedi quickly, since it begins shooting in January.] It’s a similar situation to the terrible time problem we had on Empire, but I think that this time I’ll have a much freer hand, because the Jedi screenplay that George gave me isn’t nearly as far along as Empire’s was. Robert Watts quote from The Making of Return of the Jedi:  The screenplay is the blueprint for everything, and without it you tend to flounder a bit. We’d had indications, we’d had discussions, we’d had drafts, but the final script did come very, very late. The drafts of the A New Hope script: Here is the first (rough) draft, from the invaluable Jedi Bendu Script Site. Here is the second draft, from the same site. Here is the third draft, from the same site. Fourth draft, same site.  Revised fourth draft, same site. Public version of fourth draft, same site. Analyses and summaries of the drafts/scripts: The Connoisseur’s Guide to the Scripts of the Star Wars Saga, same site. The Development of Star Wars, As Seen Through the Scripts by George Lucas, from site  referred to earlier. The Jedi Bendu Script Site also has articles on the draft variations for Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.  Some of the more glaring differences between the early drafts of the script for A New Hope and the finished movie(s): First synopsis: Interestingly, the first line of the synopsis is: This is the story of Mace Windu, a revered Jedi Bendu of Ophuchi who was related to Usby C.J. Thape, Padawaan learner of the famed Jedi. Lucas explained that he originally intended for the events of the film to be presented as though they were recorded in a journal (""The Journal of the Whills"") by an uninvolved narrator - apparently, this narrator was supposed to be a Jedi named Mace Windu.  Lucas' own words regarding the ""Journal of the Whills"" concept: Originally, I was trying to have the story be told by somebody else; there was somebody watching this whole story and recording it, somebody probably wiser than the mortal players in the actual events. I eventually dropped this idea, and the concepts behind the Whills turned into the Force. But the Whills became part of this massive amount of notes, quotes, background information that I used for the scripts; the stories were actually taken from the ‘Journal of the Whills’  First Draft: There is a Luke Skywalker, but he is nothing like our Luke Skywalker - he is a Jedi General who looks to be in his 60's but is actually much older - so we'll ignore him completely in this summary.  The character most like the one we know as Luke Skywalker was originally named Annikin Starkiller. The heroes are Kane Starkiller and his sons Annikin and Deak.  Kane is a Jedi, one of the last, and is training his sons to become Jedi. Vader, obviously, is not Annikin, nor is he the father of the Annikin/Luke character. Instead of a mask and helmet, Vader's face is covered by a black silk scarf. Vader is a general, not a Jedi (in fact, he doesn't even believe that Jedi exist), wears a normal uniform, and dies aboard the Death Star  Almost everyone uses a lightsaber - even Stormtroopers. Lightsabers are at least as common as blasters (imagine how much less awesome Jedi would be if their unique and iconic weapons weren't unique or iconic at all). What we know as the Dark Side of the Force is instead called the ""Bogan Force"" or ""para-Force""; what we know as the Light Side of the Force is called the ""Ashla Force"";  what we know as the Force is called the ""Force of Others"".  The Jedi are referred to as ""Jedi Bendu"".  The standard Jedi Bendu way of saying goodbye is ""May the Force of Others be with you"". The first movie focuses on Kane Starkiller, the leader of the Alliance, sending his sons on a mission to retrieve the ""Kiber Crystal"" from a man named Owen Lars (who isn't Annikin's/Luke's uncle).  The Kiber Crystal is a diamond-like gem that can magnify either side of the Force a hundredfold.  Kane intends to use it to destroy the Death Star. Han Solo was originally a lizard-like creature with gills, an idea Lucas fortunately dropped by the time he wrote the second draft. Chewbacca wears clothes - specifically, a flak jacket and brown cargo shorts (as well as his trademark bandoliers. Leia is 14, and instead of being Annikin/Luke's sister, she falls in love with him.  Biggs is her little brother. Grande Mouff Tarkin isn't a bad guy, nor an Imperial official, just a wimp. The description of Wookiees (spelled ""Wookees"" in the first draft) is worth mentioning:  They are huge, gray, and furry, with large yellow eyes. They resemble giant bush-babies or lemurs.  They can squawk, jabber, yell, scream, laugh, screech, chatter, and cheer. They hug and kiss to show affection, and kneel and bow to show respect.      Second Draft: In the second draft, Luke is much more like the Luke we know.  Here is how the Jedi Bendu site's summary of the second draft describes the manner in which we first encounter Luke:  The two droids... find the Moisture Farm of Owen Lars. The farm houses Owen’s wife, Beru, and Lars’ sixteen year old daughter, Leia. Also living there are Luke Starkiller, who is short and a little chubby, and Luke’s younger brothers Biggs and Windy Starkiller. Luke likes to study fossils in the Dune Sea when he is not practicing with his lazersword [""lazersword"" was Lucas' unimaginative original name for the lightsaber]. Luke's father is dead. Luke and his mother lived with Owen Lars, Owen's wife Beru, and their daughter Leia on the Lars family's moisture farm; Luke's mother died some time later.  Leia therefore grew up living with Luke, who is about 2 years older than her, and she has a crush on him.  She is clearly not a princess, nor is she his birth sister. In this draft, Owen has enthusiastically tried to teach Luke to become a warrior (presumably of the Jedi variety), but Luke shows little interest in anything other than lazersword practice and digging for fossils.  This is effectively the opposite of the Owen/Luke dynamic we see in the finished movie.  In the second draft, instead of Annikin and Deak using the Kiber Crystal to destroy the Death Star (the version of events in the first draft), Luke flies his attack ship towards a familiar exhaust port on the battle station's surface. Vader pursues him in a fighter craft and is about to fire his weapons at Luke's ship, when out of nowhere, Han Solo's ship appears and blasts Vader's fighter out of the battle.  Luke focuses on his task, steering his ship towards the small exhaust hole ahead, then...  C-3PO FIRES THE TORPEDOES INTO THE PORT, DESTROYING THE DEATH STAR.  You read that right - the torpedo that destroys the Death Star is fired not by Luke himself, but by his gunner - C-3PO.  Obi Wan/Ben Kenobi does not appear in either the first or the second draft.  He was a later addition.  Even after he was added, he was supposed to survive the first two films.  When filming for A New Hope was more than half over, Lucas decided to kill him off to add a sense of drama.  Since Obi Wan was supposed to be the one who continued Luke's training in the second film, now that he was dead Lucas needed someone else to train Luke.  This is how Yoda came about.  Incidentally, Sir Alec Guinness was less than happy about suddenly finding out that the script had been changed and his character was being killed off. Although this applies to The Empire Strikes Back, not A New Hope, I have to mention it here: Yoda was originally named ""Minch"". He was fairly harsh, and refused to let Luke eat until his training was complete.    Lucas claims that by the time A New Hope was released, the idea that Vader is Luke's father was set in stone.  The early drafts of the Empire Strikes Back script, however, seem to contradict this.  It seems more likely that this idea only occurred to Lucas well after filming for Empire had begun.  The same may be true of the idea that Luke and Leia are brother and sister."
What does the scene during the ending represent?,"Per director Stanley Kubrick: The ballroom photograph at the very end suggests the reincarnation of Jack. How does it relate to the movie? It sort of echoes the ""You’ve always been the caretaker."" line earlier in the film, which suggests something along the lines that his soul is perpetually stuck at/destined to end up at that hotel."
How did the T-Rex reach the vehicles in Jurassic Park?,"As explained on the Jurassic Park Wikia, there is a hill side drop to the left of the cars: Often incorrectly regarded as a goof is the fact that when the Tyrannosaurus exits her paddock from ground level with the road, there's the sudden appearance of a cliff when she pushes the car over it. In reality, there is in fact a cliff that acts as a natural barrier for the Tyrannosaurus, otherwise she would be able to exit her paddock through the gap between the fencing and the tunnel with ease. The diagram on the right illustrates what happens. "
Why have this character involved in Infinity War at all?,"This is answered by Russo brothers themselves: Joe Russo: Somebody had to be the gatekeeper to the Soul Stone and
somebody had to distribute the rules to Thanos and Gamora. Anthony Russo: In a way that was credible and believable. Joe Russo: Who felt credible to the audience. And a character who has
been trapped – the Red Skull has been turned into this wraith who now
guards the Soul Stone and distributes the rules to whoever shows up
there trying to obtain it. It felt like there was more credibility
than just a random character. Anthony Russo: Somebody who has a history with the stones may seem
like they have a little more authority in terms of their experience –
especially a tragic experience. - uproxx.com So it looks like they picked someone who had a history with infinity stones. And remember Red Skull is a famous recurring character in marvel comics and we didn't really see enough of him compared to his comics arcs."
Why do Mickey's ears rotate and shift location when he is not facing the camera?,"To make the Mickey symbol more recognizable, the more authentic depiction was abandoned. From Wikipedia: Ub Iwerks designed Mickey's body out of circles in order to make the character simple to animate. Disney employees John Hench and Marc Davis believed that this design was part of Mickey's success as it made him more dynamic and appealing to audiences. Mickey's circular design is most noticeable in his ears, which in traditional animation, always appear circular no matter which way Mickey faces. This made Mickey easily recognizable to audiences and made his ears an unofficial personal trademark. Even today, the rudimentary symbol Mickey Mouse is often used to represent Mickey (see Hidden Mickey). This later created a dilemma for toy creators who had to recreate a three-dimensional Mickey. In animation in the 1940s Mickey's ears were animated in a more realistic perspective. This unrealistic depiction is so iconic, it was even replicated somehow in 3d later on. Says John Ford, one of the animators of the video game Epic Mickey: We did some tests with Mickey without ears that were facing the camera and it just didn’t hold up,” said John Ford, one of the animators at Junction Point, “so we decided to go with the facing ears. We had some really smart programmers write code that would always make sure that, no matter which way Mickey was facing, you would have ears that not only faced the camera correctly but also oriented correctly on his head"". In the end, cartoons aren't exactly about realism but about expression. As animator Richard Williams says in his book The Animator's Survival Kit: Good drawing is not copying the surface. It has to do with understanding and expression. We don’t want to learn to draw just to end up being imprisoned in showing off our knowledge of joints and muscles. We want to get the kind of reality that a camera can’t get. [...] Many cartoonists and animators say that the very reason they do cartoons is to get away from realism and the realistic world into the free realms of the imagination. They’ll correctly point out that most cartoon animals don’t look like animals - they’re designs, mental constructs. Here's an example of a more realistic perspective approach in the 40s that was eventually scrapped: "
Is the man with no name the same character?,"For me he is not. Yet I don't have a hard proof either. But until we get some definite affirmation or denial from Sergio Leone or anyone else acquainted with the project, let's take a look at what in particular might speak for the theory of him being the same character in all the movies: They are commonly known as the Dollars Trilogy (or sometimes ""Man with No Name"" Trilogy) and The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is considered a prequel to the ""Dollars""-movies. But as your question already says, this argument is easily annihilated by the fact that those movies were not intended as a trilogy initially, but this was rather a marketing decision developed after the fact by the American distributor. So not a trilogy but maybe still the same character? Apart from the same director, with Clint Eastwood they share the same actor in all the movies. But they share even more actors in major roles, like Gian Maria Volonté or Lee Van Cleef, yet I doubt Col. Mortimer would be considered to be the same character as Sentenza (The Bad). And, as you said yourself, Clint's character is, while not having much of an actual name, referred to by different nicknames in the individual movies. Then we still have the very strong argument that his character dresses and behaves similarly in all the movies. But this doesn't hold up very well in the context of this particular role. First of all, there is not much to build upon, since this character doesn't provide much exposition to his backstory or his motives. He is thus not only a Man with No Name, but even more so a Man with No History. So there isn't much to build a similarity on apart from his dress-code and his behaviour throughout the movie. But this behaviour isn't just shared by those three movies' heroes, but millions of others. Instead of depicting the exact same character in those movies, he actually embodies the stereotypical (and original) anti-hero of Spaghetti Westerns, from then on copied in a billion movies. And in fact many Spaghetti Western heroes share many traits with Clint Eastwood's character(s) in the Dollar Trilogy, yet they are of course entirely different characters. So rather than continuing the story of the man from A Fistful of Dollars, the filmmakers built upon this new and commercially and critically successful type of character, Leone as well as other directors of his time. (And it IMHO also fits to this kind of character and his complete lack of exposition that we don't know anything about his past and future, not even a prequel or a sequel.) But I agree that this is far from definite evidence against him depicting the same character and some of my arguments might be a bit speculative, but I hope to have at least given some reasonable arguments for my point. To me, it is rather the interplay of smaller circumstantial evidence and the initial marketing as a trilogy that have lead to the theory of him being the same person in all the movies. But those individual hints IMHO don't hold strong and I think the burden of proof lies on the people claiming him to be the same character, for which a definite evidence I still haven't ever been provided with. And as a last little (rather tongue-in-cheek) remark, the possible lack of a definite answer is to a large degree caused by the complete lack of any kind of background information about his character and the (maybe everlasting) question if he is the same person in each movie or not might add as much to the mystery of him as all the other nonexistent history. The unanswerability of this question might thus even be seen as by-design. ;-)"
Is the 2016 movie Trolls about opium addiction?,"Couldn't find any sources or news that confirms your theory (premise), unless there is some deep meaning that only the producers know and didn't share with the public and media.

Was Sheldon Cooper ever proven wrong?,"Apparently, there were a couple of episodes where he was wrong. I am adding what I remember, but will add more if I come across them later. In the episode, The Hamburger Postulate, Dr. Leslie Winkles corrects his wrong equation. Sheldon: My equations, someone’s tampered with my equations. Leonard: Are you sure? Sheldon: Of course I’m sure. Look at the beta-function of quantum chrono-dynamics, the sign’s been changed. Leonard: Oh yeah. But doesn’t that fix the problem you’ve been having? Sheldon: Are you insane? Are you out of your mind? Are you…. hey look, that fixes the problem I’ve been having. Lesley: (entering) You’re welcome. Sheldon: You did this? Lesley: Yeah, I noticed it when I got up to get a glass of water, so I fixed it, now you can show that quarks are asymptotically free at high energies. Pretty cool, huh? In the episode, The Bat Jar Conjecture, when Sheldon is participating the Physics Bowl against Leonard and his team, both parties are stuck on the last question. The janitor on Sheldon's team answers it right, but Sheldon refuses to make it the team's answer due to his ego. Sheldon: Hang on, hang on a second, that’s not our answer. What are you doing? Third Floor Janitor: Answering question. Winning physics bowl. Sheldon: How do you know anything about physics? Third Floor Janitor: Here I am janitor, in former Soviet Union I am physicist. Leningrad Politechnica. Go Polar Bears. Sheldon: Well that’s a delightful little story, but our arrangement was that you sit here and not say anything, I answer the questions. Third Floor Janitor: You didn’t answer question. And later, Gablehouser: Denied. I need your official answer. Sheldon: No. I decline to provide one. Gablehouser: Well, that’s too bad, because the answer your teammate gave was correct. In the episode The Hawking Excitation, when Hawking calls him to discuss about his paper, Hawking tells him that he made a arithmetical error on page 2. After that, he faints. Hawking: That’s nice. Too bad it’s wrong. Sheldon: What do you mean wrong? Hawking: You made an arithmetic mistake on page two. It was quite the boner. Sheldon: No, no, th-th-th-that can’t be right. I-I don’t make arithmetic mistakes. Hawking: Are you saying I do? Sheldon: Oh, no, no, no, of course not. It’s just, I was thinking… Oh, gosh, golly, I made a boo-boo, and I gave it to Stephen Hawking. Hawking: Great, another fainter.  In the episode, The Jiminy Conjecture, Howard and Sheldon bet whether the cricket is ordinary field one or snowy tree one. Apparently, Sheldon was proven wrong about the cricket being snowy tree one. Prof Crawley: It’s a field cricket. Howard: Yes! Sheldon: No, no, wait. Dr. Crawley, are you sure? Prof Crawley: Young man, I’ve been studying insects since I was eight years old. You know what they used to call me in school? Creepy Crawley. Script Source"
Why does Hulk act the way he does in Avengers: Infinity War?,"The last time we saw Hulk, he was overpowered and beaten badly by Thanos.  He doesn't reappear after the Bifrost transport to Earth and refuses to ""come out"" for Banner. This is the first time Hulk has ever come up against an opponent that was stronger than him, and this has shocked him to his big green core.  Hulk seems to be afraid. Even Banner states that Thanos, with the Power stone is already the strongest creature in the universe. We will likely need to wait for the next Avengers movie to get confirmation but this seems to be the most likely reason based on what we know."
Discrepancy in Thanos's use of time stone in Infinity War,"As seen in the Doctor Strange movie, the whole universe doesn't have to be affected by the time stone. One of the first things he does with the Eye of Agamotto is age and reverse age an apple. 

 This shows that the time stone is able to alter objects in localized spaces and allows Thanos to revert Vision to his former self without reversing all of the universe."
Why is the number '4' so prominent in the Death Note?,"Because apparently, Four is Death. from the TV Tropes page of the same name: In most Chinese languages and languages that borrow words from it, the words for ""four"" (四) and ""death"" (死) are written differently but pronounced similarly (somewhat like ""sì"" in Mandarin, ""sei"" in Cantonese, ""shi"" in Sino-Japanese, ""tư"" in Sino-Vietnamese, and ""sa"" in Sino-Korean). As a cultural trope, East Asian works of media tend to treat the number in much the way Western writers treat the number 13 (a number that Arabian and European culture consider Magical, and usually in a bad way)."
What was the motivation behind the Engineers actions in Prometheus?,"The Engineers are planet builders who seed planets with the gift of life. It's shown in the start of the film that the Engineers visit Earth repeatedly, as their figure pointing to a constellation of stars is found throughout history. When the film starts, an Engineer drinks the dark fluid, that starts this chain reaction of life. This fluid is so powerful, that it can turn a dead planet into a living Earth. When the crew of the Prometheus lands on the alien planet, and they enter the tomb their foot steps uncover worms that are preserved in the tomb. They are still alive and crawling. The tomb cylinders start to leak the black fluid and the worms mix with the fluid. These worms evolve into the snake like creatures that later attack the two crew members stuck in the tomb. Later, only the Prometheus captain refers to the black cylinders as bombs or weapons. When Elizabeth is talking to David she asks why the Engineers would want to destroy Earth, David replies ""sometimes before you can create you must destroy"". I don't think the Engineers were going to destroy Earth as much as ""restart"" it. It's clear they took an active role in making our planet, but they had some kind of agenda that isn't defined in the film. This is why, at the end of the film Elizabeth flies to their home world. To find out why the Engineers had decided Earth was a failure. EDIT: I answered this question two years ago, but since then a lot has been revealed about the plot for Prometheus by Ridley Scott. The following comes from various sources that I've read. At the start of the film. Illustrations of figures pointing to the stars implies this was a message from the Engineers. Ridley stated in an interview that there is nothing in the film that indicates these figures were Engineers, and the pointing could have been a warning not an invitation. Ridley says the early planet shown at the start where an Engineer sacrifices himself was not Earth, nor does it indicate if it was a historic reference or present day. Ridley Scott has said in an interview that the reason the Engineers wanted to destroy Earth (specifically mankind) was because Jesus Christ was an Engineer. The Engineers made man, man went bad so they sent an Engineer to try and fix the problem. We crucified the Engineer and apparently they didn't like this.  There are many other controversial topics related to the film, but I decided to only reference the things that came directly from Ridley."
Why didn't Mal use her totem (spinning top) before she actually died?,"Because you can't battle a notion once it's successfully 
inserted into your subconscious. Cobb: An idea is like a virus. Resilient. Highly contagious. The smallest seed of an idea can grow. It can grow to define or destroy you. Nothing could convince Mal. Presumably, Cobb had better ways than a spinning top to prove to Mal that this is reality and that the world outside and her family and friends are all real. But she wouldn't believe any of it, thinking it's all fake. This is why Cobb is wary of inception in the first place. EDIT: As onewho correctly points out, Mal also has every reason not to believe her totem anymore because it's what Cobb used for her inception when he spinned it inside her safe. So the byproduct of the concept 'your world is not real' might be 'and your totem has been tampered with'. Ultimately, this was the problem with Mal's inception. It was predicated on manipulation, which led only to doubt and mistrust. Compare it with Fischer's successful inception which ended positively because he eventually filled the safe with his own concepts and its content wasn't manually rigged by others."
Why does 2001: A Space Odyssey not provide an explanation of its ending? Are we supposed to read the book?,"To me the brilliance of 2001 lies in that it's a perfect storm of brilliant individual parts. It has jaw-dropping cinematography and SFX (that holds its own even in this CGI rich era), an iconic soundtrack, amazing writing (HAL remains one of the most chilling adversaries in movie history), and an intentionally ambiguous ending.  When you finish watching 2001 you are left with more questions that answers. Now, if you read up on anything related to the greater cosmos around us you'll get the same feeling of delicious bewilderment. That is part of the message of 2001 (the book or the movie); mankind as a tiny insignificant speck trying to find its place in a vast universe it can't begin to fully comprehend. You don't need to read the book (although I do recommend that you do) to enjoy the movie on its own merits, as there isn't any truly ""canonical"" explanation to the events of the movie. You're supposed to feel lost at the end. Which, in my opinion, the movie does better than the book."
"What is ""historical smoking""?","TL;DR: Some distributors have context-related descriptors for their movies: Disney for example says NO to new characters smoking in new films, but if a historical figure is portrayed smoking, because it was what they really did back then, then it gets a ""historical smoking"" descriptor. (Following criticism from senators and pressure groups, the group responsible for the rating systems, MPAA, announced a shift in policy in 2007 to consider the use of smoking when rating films from then on. That policy has been updated since then to include anyone seen smoking in films, and the descriptors used showed added context (ie. 'historical' for period-relevant smoking depiction) The following does give light to where the meaning comes from and its distinction form normal smoking: https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/alan-horn-talks-disney-fox-merger-streaming-pixar-post-john-lasseter-1187054/ With Fox, we can make movies that right now I say no to. Take Bohemian Rhapsody, which is PG-13. It’s a hit movie and very, very good. But there’s no way we could make it under the Disney label because the characters smoke cigarettes and other content. Nor could we have made [Warner Bros.’ R-rated] Oscar-winning Argo because the characters smoke and use the F-word. We always have to think about the smoking policy. The audience for a Disney movie may not know what they are going to see, but they know what they aren’t going to see. There are certain things we just can’t include because we’ll get letters. So, smoking and bad language, that explains why we don't see those in the films. However there is a caveat to the smoking ban if it is period accurate! Speaking at the Disney shareholder meeting in 2015, executive and former CEO of Disney, Bob Iger, said: ""We are extending our policy to prohibit smoking in movies across the board: Marvel, Lucas, Pixar and Disney films. ""In terms of any new characters that are created for any of those films, under any of those labels, we will absolutely prohibit smoking in any of those films."" However, he added: ""Except when we are depicting a historical figure who may have smoked at the time. ""For instance, we've been doing a movie on Abraham Lincoln, he was a smoker, and we would consider that acceptable."" https://www.mirror.co.uk/film/disney-films-ban-meaning-you-23548771 The Motion Picture Association of America has announced that, along with swearing, sex and violence, smoking on screen will help determine what audience-rating a film receives. The MPAA says it will consider how much a movie glorifies tobacco use, and who's doing the puffing. The movie board says they will weigh historic context, as well. https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=10141697 MPAA Chairman Dan Glickman said his group's ratings board, which previously had considered underage smoking in assigning film ratings, now will take into account smoking by adults, as well. Film raters will consider the pervasiveness of tobacco use, whether it glamorizes smoking and the context in which smoking appears, as in movies set in the past when smoking was more common. Descriptions on sex, violence and language that accompany movie ratings now will include such phrases as ""glamorized smoking"" or ""pervasive smoking,"" Glickman said. If rated today, a film such as 2005's ""Good Night, and Good Luck,"" about chain-smoking newsman Edward R. Murrow, would have carried a ""pervasive smoking"" tag but probably would have retained its PG rating because of its historical context in the 1950s, Graves said. https://escholarship.org/content/qt5sr9w2s1/qt5sr9w2s1_noSplash_8e29988a7d738adc7ad7c334a752c557.pdf Are MPAA’s tobacco labels
protecting movie audiences? The MPAA has never used the phrases “pervasive smoking” or “glamorized
smoking,” as it originally proposed. Instead, it has either used “smoking,” with nothing to
indicate the harm potential, or modified “smoking” with terms that minimize or even
justify (“historical smoking”) the film’s tobacco content. Overrated? It’s a PG-13 world; we’re just living in it Drug use, teen drinking and even smoking can give the MPAA ratings mavens the conniptions. “The Imitation Game,” another decorous period piece, was tagged PG-13 because of “historical smoking.” https://eu.galesburg.com/story/entertainment/movies/2015/08/13/ben-steelman-overrated-it-s/33685140007/ https://www.backstage.com/magazine/article/mpaa-adds-smoking-film-rating-factor-29444/ https://www.cnsnews.com/mrctv-blog/eric-scheiner/warning-historical-smoking-and-e-cigarettes-are-visible Smoking Makes a Cinematic Comeback Smoking also raises ratings issues in movies. It was seldom seen on TV for a while (TV ads for tobacco products have been banned since 1971) but has returned with vigor, especially on streaming services. Some historical figures, such as Winston Churchill with his cigar in Darkest Hour (2017), would not seem accurately portrayed without their tobacco products. These widely accepted, but not universally true, ideas about how much people used to smoke in the old days have given rise to the interesting MPAA rating description “historical smoking.” https://publicsquaremag.org/media-education/for-mature-audiences-only-relabeling-crass-media/ The linked PDF also includes a list of various descriptors applied between 2007-2010: https://escholarship.org/content/qt8hn866tt/qt8hn866tt_noSplash_7901ea31c2ee8889a48bd25c4fdde316.pdf"
Why did Hank Pym choose Scott Lang?,"Hank Pym had a job that required a very specific set of skills that aren't very common. Meet Scott Lang: While it's not shown in the movie, it's not a hard stretch to assume that Hank had a few candidates in mind. He was probably observing all of them over time. We do know that Hank was watching Scott already based off this quote (found by Johnny Bones in the comments): Scott, I've been watching you for a while. Ever since you robbed Vistacorp. Oh, excuse me, burgled Vistacorp. Vista's security system is one of the most advanced in the business, it's supposed to be unbeatable but you beat it. Vistacorp most likely has very similar security measures as Pym Technologies. From that, it's safe to assume that Scott has gotten further than anyone before. Hank set up the break in on his house as a sort of final job interview to see if Scott could pull it off. It was also a convenient excuse to get Scott to him so they could meet. "

"How did Jack get to the island, and how did he become so important so quickly?","Near the beginning of Curse of the Black Pearl, there's a great gag where, as Elizabeth is falling off the cliff, we cut to Jack Sparrow saying ""And then they made me their chief.""  This was an improvised line, and at the time didn't refer to any established backstory. In the DVD commentary for Dead Man's Chest, the writers explain that the Pelegostos are the tribe who made Jack their chief—that is, they invented a backstory for Depp's joke for the purposes of the new movie. So Jack didn't have to become that important in the limited time he spends offscreen in Dead Man's Chest; he already was their chief, and this was his triumphant return! This also helps to explain how Gibbs already knows about the religious traditions of the Pelegostos: Presumably they had attempted to release Jack from his fleshy prison during his first visit. But why would Jack return to an island where the natives want to kill him, and how did he get there so fast? I suspect both questions have the same answer: The island of the Pelegostos happened to be the nearest place that was safe from the Kraken. Jack knew where the island was, he knew that the natives would be friendly (at least initially), and although he knew of the danger, in typical Jack Sparrow style he assumed he would escape somehow."
"Why does ""The Force Awakens"" use an image language associated with national socialism for the First Order?","It isn't just in The Force Awakens that this is the case. The original trilogy drips with it: George Lucas has also stated that he sees the rise of the Empire as an allegory to the rise of Nazi Germany and that the uniforms are based on German officer uniforms. The Force Awakens is just carrying on the theme previously set in the original trilogy that the Empire is a Fascist regime and as such borrows from the most famous fascists of them all, the Nazis. The Force Awakens may lean more heavily on this as they are the remnants of the empire made up of the ultras, the true believers, and as such want to push the ideology to the forefront of what they do. 
Also as with Nazi Germany, the Empire probably did not see the need for mass rallies having cemented their power (the Nazis stopped the Nuremburg rallies in 1938), but with the Empire crumbling, the Emperor dead and their ideology threatened the First Order can use it to keep everyone believing.  In a Time article JJ Abrams specifically mentions the parallels to Nazism in The Force Awakens which follows the same ideas as my speculation above. His line  ""...what would have happened if the Nazis all went to Argentina but then started working together again?"" Shows us the First Order is how he thinks the remnants of Nazi Germany would have gone had they tried to rebuild out of the ashes.  (Looking at the two pictures below only the scale has changed and flags have been added, probably to make up for the red missing due to the absence of the Imperial guard).

Why couldn't Bond have backup at the battle of Skyfall?,"From what I can remember: When Bond ""kidnaps"" M she says: Too many people are dying because of me. Bond suggests that they use Silva's desire to kill M to their advantage. M agrees to play the bait, but insists: Just us, no one else. Bond then asks Q to create a  ... trail of breadcrumbs impossible to follow except for Silva. When Q asks if this is official, Bond answers: Not even remotely. So, Bond and M going rogue explains why there are no reinforcements.
 What Bond didn't know was that Skyfall had been sold when he was believed to have died.  When Bond asks Kincade about the gun room he learns that all the guns had been sold to a collector weeks ago (except for Bond's father's hunting rifle). This explains why they had to improvise."
Why didn't Loki use the Tesseract?,"It appears difficult to use the Tesseract for these purposes without some extra mechanical agency to help control its power. The fist time we see the Tesseract open a portal (at the end of Captain America: The First Avenger) it seems to be entirely random following it getting struck during the battle on the Valkyrie, whisking the Red Skull off to Vormir or wherever after he melted... The second time we see it used to open a portal is when Loki uses it to get to Earth at the start the The Avengers. Some sort of contraption has been built at the S.H.I.E.L.D / NASA Dark Energy facility with Selvig's help in order to do this (with the possibility that he may have been subtly influenced to do this from a distance, evidenced by the post - credit tag at the end of Thor - ""Well, I guess that's worth a look""). This first effort by Selvig is imperfect however and the portal collapses, something that is rectified by the end of the film due to the use of the Iridium in the second attempt, allowing the Chitauri to pass through. The fourth time it is used (to allow Thor and Loki to return to Asgard) it is contained in some sort of contraption, one which did not appear recoverable along with the Tesseract during the short time available at the end of Thor: Ragnarok. Finally, even when we see it used for the first time in Avengers: Infinity War, Thanos has to install it into the Infinity Gauntlet first, suggesting that even a being as powerful as he needs some sort of mechanism to use the stone."
Why do old movies sound like old movies?,"One of the biggest differences between older films and more modern ones is the changing nature of acting over the years. The further back you go in the history of film, the more you'll find movie acting merging with stage acting: Big movements, bombastic delivery, exaggerated facial expressions. As acting on film began adapting to the medium (the ability to have close-ups, etc), the medium itself adapting and developing (camera work becoming more agile; initially cameras stayed further back and were often stationary, really doing nothing more than framing films like stage plays) and with the introduction of things like The Method, people were able to develop a much more subtle, intimate and nuanced acting style. One of my favourite films is the Coens' The Man Who Wasn't There (2001). Not only does the camera spend much of the movie trained on Billy Bob Thornton's face - so much of his work in that film involves subtle, almost imperceptible changes in facial expressions and eye movements - it's really a good example of something that couldn't and wouldn't have been done that way many decades ago. I recently watched an old Hitchcock film starring a young Paul Newman (Torn Curtain, 1966). He stood out from other cast members on that movie as he was already developing a much more ""modern"" acting style. It was a good exercise in the contrast. Regarding sound effects: early on, American and British film and TV were very similar, but America soon started using a much more developed system of foley which the British didn't bother with for some time. Even today, American film and TV have a much more complete foley approach (having created the role of foley artist, based in the work of Jack Foley).  Extensive foley work gives a much greater control over the sound of final product, just as post production effects give control over the image. Along the way, you notice the refining of the foley presence and process (just as you do with post-production effects); it's much more heavy-handed before it settled down into a streamlined and nuanced process. You can read about the origins of foley here, and the more general history of its development here. As for speech in film, you'll notice changes over time: there is the speed of their speech. In early periods of film, the cultural perception was that rapid delivery evinced certainty and confidence, and as an extra bonus, a lot of speech covered up lacks in sound effects or the presence of too much background noise (dialogue was harder to isolate with older technology).  And as others have said, the accent often used in earlier American films is the Mid-Atlantic or Trans-Atlantic accent, which was ""a consciously learned blend of American English and British English, intended to favor neither."" While this attempt to use an accent acceptable to either the British or American ear has fallen by the wayside in favour of the actual American vernacular, the tendency still exists in a small way, like when Canadians adjust their accent to sound neither specifically Canadian nor American, or when actors from my part of the world adjust how they speak to sound neither distinctly like an Australian or a New Zealander, for example."
What exactly is 70mm print and why does anyone care?,"There are several orthogonal issues here: Some of the comments and other answers are conflating various aspects, which can cause more confusion than clarification.  For example, others have implied the 70mm and IMAX are the same thing.  While it's true IMAX does project from 70mm prints, 70mm prints are used in a variety of other, non-IMAX formats. Before the switch to digital, most commercial movies were shot on 35mm negatives and then distributed to theaters as 35mm or sometimes 70mm prints.  (Yes, some 70mm prints are sometimes made from 35mm masters.) A few big budget, ""big screen"" movies were sometimes shot in 70mm and distributed to big theaters on 70mm prints and smaller theaters on 35mm prints. The sizes, 35mm and 70mm, refer to the width of the film itself.  This width includes the room for the sprocket holes and analogue audio tracks.  Some digital audio tracks use the spaces between the sprocket holes.  I believe (but correct me if I'm wrong) that magnetic audio tracks are not included in that width. Most film runs through the projector vertically (big exceptions are true IMAX and VistaVision), so the width the frame is limited by the width of the film minus the width of the sprocket holes and analogue audio tracks.  Thus the width of a frame on a 35mm print is a bit narrower than 35mm. The sprocket holes are often called ""perfs,"" and many formats are thus referred to as a number of ""perfs.""  That is, as the number of sprocket holes from one frame to the next.  A typical frame size for 35mm prints is 4-perf.  Thus the height of the frame was limited by that number.  For 70mm, I believe common formats were 7-perf, but I don't have a source for that. The aspect ratio is the ratio of the width to the height.  In olden times, movies were pretty square, much like old television sets.  To compete with television, the studios introduced different aspect ratios (typically wider) in order to make the movie experience seem more immersive than television. Given that the width and height of the frame both have upper bounds, there are only a few ways to adjust the aspect ratio: Use less than the full height available on the frame, and use a telephoto projection lens to compensate for the diminished height. Shoot (or print) the frames with an anamorphic lens that squishes the image horizontally to fit it onto the film, then project with the complementary lens that stretches it back out.  This is typically done for the widest of wide-screen formats.  A telltale artifact is that lens flares appear as ovals rather than circles. Run the film horizontally.  The height is limited by the film size minus sprocket holes, and the width is limited by however many perfs you choose.  This is what traditional IMAX does.  (Traditional IMAX also uses 70mm film exclusively.) Given identical aspect ratios, 70mm film gives far more area per frame, which means it can be projected larger or will have better clarity and detail when projected as the same size as a comparable 35mm print. Some movies are shot in a variety of formats, but mastered into a common format during editing and post production.  For example, the original Star Wars films used old VistaVision cameras for many of the motion-controlled model shots, even though everything else was probably shot with traditional cameras that ran the film vertically. In the case of this Tarantino film, I suspect it was shot on 70mm using anamorphic lenses in order to make a super-widescreen.  IMDB confirms."
Why didn't Bane reveal to the public that Bruce Wayne is Batman?,In the movie Bane was trying to cause chaos in the city by pitting the rich against the poor. You see those judgements passed for the rich people who lived their life so luxuriously given by Crane. Revealing the fact that Bruce Wayne (who is one of the richest people in the gotham) to be Batman might create the idea that not all rich people are bad and might make Bruce being pictured as a hero in the eyes of Poor who would probably start questioning Bane's ideals and could very well jeopardize Bane's plan.

Why do TV comedy programs have laugh tracks?,"Because hearing laughter when watching comic shows makes people inclined to regard them as funnier than they would normally. Really. Even when they are intelligent. Even when they know it's fake, canned laughter. I know this is hard to believe, but behavioural psychologists have run the tests, and the results are unambiguous: laugh tracks work, no matter how informed or intelligent the audience is. (Only have pop-sci books as sources for that, ask on Cognitive Science if you want the primary sources.) As for why some shows do it and others don't: fundamentally, people who find a program funnier are more likely to keep watching, ergo more ad dollars. The downside is that some people might find the laugh track offensive and not watch out of spite. Clearly different producers have different expectations of which effect will predominate, which leads to different choices; the production cost of adding laugh tracks is rather small, and probably not decisive."

How does Jesse connect the dots in S05E11?,"This is because Jesse is a lot smarter than the viewers give him credit for. Initially, Jesse only helped Walt because of Walt's speech about Gus poisoning Brock with the ricin in order to manipulate him into not only giving permission to kill Walt, but to do it himself. Jesse, realizing these pieces fit believes him and helps Walt get the information he needs to finish Gus off.  However at the end of Face Off it is revealed that Brock was actually poisoned by a flower called Lily of the Valley, later revealed to be in Walt's backyard, thus implicating Walt in the poisoning. It has yet to be revealed how exactly Brock was poisoned, but nevertheless the facts remain that Walt orchestrated the ricin cigarette to be lifted from Jesse in order to help prove this idea, along with planting the fake in the Roomba to convince him that he had nothing to do with the poisoning in the first place. Skip ahead to Confessions Jesse pieces together that Huell must have lifted the ricin cigarette from him just like his weed this time.  From here he connects that Saul must have had something to do with the poisoning considering this is his perceived second time having something lifted by Huell. He then goes to Saul's office, literally beats the truth out of him that it was all orchestrated by Walt.  This sends Jesse into a fit of rage, ready to burn down the White residence at the end of the episode. The whole connection goes back to Jesse realizing that the only person that wanted Gus dead at that point, was Walt.  There is only one person he knew of that was that vindictive and manipulative enough to accomplish this task and instead of just asking for Jesse's help in eliminating him, he went to the trouble of not only poisoning a child, something very against Jesse's ideals, but a child that Jesse was close to to begin with.   While Walt may not be the one directly responsible for Brock's poisoning, Jesse believes that no one else could have orchestrated such an act whether or not it was actually Kuby, or Huell, or Saul, or a random meth head that did it, it all points back to Walt's planning and idea."

Cage also notes this when he wakes up in a military hospital after a botched attempt to retrieve the transponder prototype, as the result of a blood transfusion. As such, it would seem the ability is something you can feel, and thus you can tell when you've lost it."
What does the Night King really want?,"It's not clear yet what is his purpose beyond the wall but we know some things and therefore we can speculate. First and most important: the White Walkers were created centuries ago before the long night by the Children of the Forest as a weapon to fight back the first men as can be seen in the TV show. Second: after the White Walkers were created both men and Children of the Forest had to fight them. They both made an alliance and were able to defeat the White Walkers (the Azor Ahai legend is from this period of time). After this, they built the wall and for some time the Children of the Forest even provided the Night Watch with Dragon Glass in the case of the Walkers came back. From this, we can speculate that the magic that created the White Walkers went wrong and they turned against everyone in their way. They could be just a weapon that is out of control (I don't believe so) or they could be conscious and want revenge or even want to conquer Westeros. Personally, I tend to believe that revenge would be more plausible since the way the Night King (the first Night Walker) was created. He was just a man, probably a soldier from the first men captured by the Children of the Forest. [EDIT] As commented below the wall was built after the Night King was created. (The Night King is the reason why the wall was built)
 Again, we still don't know his objective this is just speculation."
What was the purpose of Candie's handshake in Django Unchained?,"I believe it is to be interpreted as ""getting the last laugh"", ""getting one up"", or ""getting the better"" of the other person. A game of wits in which the two are playing mind games with each other to see who can get the last laugh.  Throughout the scenes leading up to this moment, after Candie forces Schultz to pay 12,000 for Broomhilda, Candie repeatedly says things to Schultz such as: You're just upset that I got the better of you  (not an exact quote), implying that he outwitted Schultz. So when Schultz refuses to shake Candie's hand, Candie devises a scheme to ""get one up"" and force Schultz to shake his hand, to which Schultz replies with a gun shot to the chest. Schultz ultimately gets the better of Candie, but does so knowing he will lose his life. ""I couldn't resist"" shrugs "
Why did it take a rocket to lift off the Earth but just shuttles to lift off the other planets?,"The same question was also asked on Quora, with various interesting answers, even if it's hard to say which one is correct and they all sound quite plausible. Everyone seems to agree though, that both Lander and Ranger are very much capable of planetary lift-offs and could as well have left earth on their own. Remains the question why they chose a rocket-aided lift-off for earth. The most-compelling in-universe answers are: Yet there is also a very good out-of-universe answer mentioned, which I'd like the most (since I appreciate analysis more than fan-fiction, but that's just me ;-)), even if it's probably to be seen in connection to the other explanations: As a little addendum, after a fruitful discussion I indeed managed to get together a computation for the escape velocity on Miller's planet in an answer to a related question over on Physics.SE (similar to jld's computation in his answer here), giving that the planet has only about 96% of earth's escape velocity. So it is indeed a little bit easier to leave it than earth (and even more likely for Mann's planet, which following the computed constraints would have to have only more than 64% of earth's density to be easier to lift off). But I still stand to the above assumption, that they could also have left earth without a rocket, hadn't they had the additional cargo, fuel constraints and obligation to show us a good old rocket launch."
What does the missing symbol on Quaid's arm symbolize?,"Here is a detailed comparison between the Theatrical and Extended Director's Cut. One of the differences is an additional scene at the end: Doug looks down and removes the bandage from the spot where the injection tattoo was burned in at Rekall – it cannot be seen anymore.  One could interpret this as a hint that Quaid is still in a dream world. Although, that 'tattoo' might have been just a stamp mark that had rubbed off."
What was really behind the mysterious number sequence in Lost?,"The only other real explanation given for the numbers relates back to one of the bonus features with DHARMA showing that the numbers are actually part of an equation that predicts mankind's extinction. The other major explanation of the numbers are, as you say, part of Jacob's numbering of the final candidates:  4 - Locke 8 - Reyes 15 - Ford 16 - Jarrah 23 - Shephard 42 - Kwon Also on Lostpedia, you can find uses of the numbers strewn across the whole series as a bit of an Easter Egg for those paying attention (and not just in this series) The reason for the numbers to be entered into the computer was to discharge the magnetic power that the Swam station contained.  The first time we witness the numbers not being entered caused Oceanic 815 to crash in the first place (the plane flying over and the magnetic field becoming to strong, causing the plane to get out of control and break up and crash). The second time we witness the numbers being missed is when Locke destroyed the computer, causing Desmond to activate the Fail-Safe, blowing up the Swan and the power it would try to contain in the first place.  I can only assume they chose this sequence of numbers either because of the aforementioned equation or because it was the ""serial number"" of the base.  As far as Hugo, because the numbers have this strange relation to the extinction of man, it could be implied that using them would cause bad luck.  However, this is never heavily implied and can be just a plot device/just a string of terrible events that happened in his life. Other than these explanations, there have been no other pure explanations for the Lost numbers by any of the creators or writers that I can find. One final note to add, an answer from Damon Lindelof, explaining why the numbers don't have a definite meaning throughout the series using the Midi-chlorians from Star Wars as an example: There are some questions that are very engaging and interesting, and then there are other questions that we have no interest whatsoever in answering. We call it the midi-chlorian debate, because at a certain point, explaining something mystical demystifies it. To try and have a character come and say, ""Here is what the numbers mean,"" actually makes every usage of the numbers up to that point less interesting. You can actually watch Star Wars now, and when Obi-Wan talks about the Force to Luke for the first time, it loses its luster because the Force has been explained as, sort of, little biological agents that are in your blood stream. So you go, ""Oh, I liked Obi-Wan's version a lot better."" Which in the case of our show is, ""The numbers are bad luck, they keep popping up in Hurley's life, they appear on the island."" ... But if you're watching the show for a detailed explanation of what the numbers mean—and I'm not saying you won't see more of them—then you will be disappointed by the end of season six."
What changes were made to the Star Wars Blu-ray and what effect did they have on the plot?,"I would like to just sum this up as the jumbled effect. Lucas basically wants as much action going on in his movies as humanly possible. Adding attention to items that we already know are there. This can be seen more vividly in Star Wars 1-3 where he adds more characters and objects to the set.  A lot of inference is lost because of this. Instead of asking oneself why an object is on the screen just offset from center, we have the object in plain view center focus, distracting from what is important, establishing the plot and following through with that plot. Items like these distract the viewer from what is actually going on. The most controversial change with Darth Vader, changes the emotion and environment of the scene completely. Nooooooooooooo!  To who? himself? the emperor? the dark side? to his son dying? Too many questions it was better left mute and let the background music take care of adding in the emotion as well the turning point to that scene, making that scene appear longer than it really is. Now that ""no"" extends across this entire section, the turning point is now a sharp inflection leading the viewer wanting the scene to be over as quickly as possible."
Why does Bran want to find Drogon?,"Drogon is capable of single-handedly wiping out an entire city in a reasonably short period of time. One of the strongest armed cities in Westeros (with weapons designed specifically for him) was devastated and leveled by Drogon. He indiscriminately incinerated (yes at Dany's orders) men, women and children - military and civilian alike; there is no reason to believe that with Dany gone his ethics are going to be somehow purer than hers. The woman who was like a mother to him is dead, along with his two siblings and he is now alone in the world. They don't know what motivates him now that he is alone; Drogon may now pose the greatest potential threat in all of the known world. Is he likely to come back to incinerate everyone? Are you going to wait till he is there to find out or are you going to keep tabs on him for the rest of his life?"
Why is the new movie named Ocean's 8?,"Because there are eight con-women in this movie as there were 11, 12 and 13 con-men in the Ocean's trilogy...

What's so hard about guest-hosting Jeopardy?,"Possibly something to do with the fact that they film 5 episodes a day during the filming period and the presenter having to make themselves look completely fresh for each and every one.  It's a punishing schedule and for such a high-profile show, it needs to look perfect every single time. The Official Jeopardy Website has an article detailing Trebek's working day: 5:15am when he wakes up. After a quick morning routine, he’s out the door at 5:30am sharp and in his truck on the way to Stage 10 to shoot five episodes of Jeopardy! A quick 30-minute commute puts him in Culver City at 6am
6:00 - 7:30am: Reads the newspaper, does the daily crossword puzzle, signs autograph requests and viewer mail.
7:30 - 8:45am: Receives the five ""show scripts"" for the day from head writer Billy Wisse, and reviews each script, making diacritical marks, looking up pronunciations, identifying potential problem clues, etc.
8:45am: Meet with Rocky Schmidt, Supervising Producer, to go over schedules, personal appearance and publicity requests, etc.
9:00 - 10:00am: Meets with Harry Friedman, Lisa Broffman, Billy Wisse, C&P, and other writers and researchers and go over all five shows, discussing issues anyone may have found in those shows.
10:00 - 10:30am: Relaxes in his dressing room, where the TV is usually tuned to the news or Turner Classic Movies.
10:30 - 11:15am: Hair and makeup.
11:15am - 12:00pm: First show of the day tapes during this time, and the games usually tape true to time, unless there is a technical problem. During the tapings of all shows, in the commercial breaks, Alex has a back-and-forth discussion with the audience, takes questions, and engages in playful banter with the audience.
12:00 - 12:15pm: Changes into a new suit. The returning champion also changes clothes so that people at home don't wonder why they only have one outfit for the week.
12:15 - 1:00pm: Alex tapes the second show for the day.
1:00 - 1:15pm: New show, new suit.
1:15 - 2:00pm: Tapes the third show of the day with the same audience. Each tape day has two audiences – the first audience sees the first three tapings, the second audience sees the last two.
2:00pm: If there are special promotional requests, Public Service Announcements, contestant search promos, and anything else to record, those are done at this point. Then the whole crew breaks for lunch from 2:00 to 3:00, where Alex usually enjoys the soup of the day or sushi.
3:00pm: Make-up/touchup.
3:00 - 3:45pm: Tape fourth show in front of a ""new"" studio audience.
3:45pm: Last suit of the day.
3:45 - 4:15pm: Tape the last show of the day – the fifth. So it's not just a case of turning up, chatting a bit, asking a few questions and going home again. The presenter (and crew) need to do this to a high level of quality (and make it look easy!) every day for 46 days before turning the studio over to other shows. So yes, this is a tough job for someone who's not used to this schedule and this level of pressure in presenting one of the highest rated shows on TV."
Why does Homer handle a rod of uranium in the opening?,"Homer's first job was actually not a Nuclear Safety Inspector. He was a ""nuclear technician"" or ""technical supervisor"" (No one really knows. Not even him). In S01E03, he is fired from this job. He eventually becomes a ""safety crusader"" after witnessing all the safety violations the plant commits. Mr. Burns re-hires him as a safety inspector to shut him up. That part of the opening sequence has been unchanged for the entire span of the show.  What you're actually seeing is Homer at his original ""Nuclear Technician"" job before he became a safety inspector. "
Why does Wolverine drink alcohol?,"From his wiki: Wolverine's natural healing also affords him the virtual immunity to
  poisons and most drugs, except in massive doses. For example, it is
  extremely difficult for him to become intoxicated from alcohol. So to answer your question: Intoxication is a state of being poisoned. Shouldn't his powers prevent him from it?  They do, largely. But your first question was: why does he drink? The fact his body makes it hard for him to get drunk doesn't mean there's no reason for him to drink. There's plenty of reasons to drink, including: Ultimately, just because his body can fight off being drunk quite quickly doesn't mean there's no reason for him to drink at all."
Significance of Cersei's obsession with elephants?,"In the novels, we received a long narrative about the elephants of The Golden Company, which was left out of the show. In George R. R. Martin’s fifth GOT novel, A Dance With Dragons, we learn of The Golden Company through a rather long-winded side story that has thankfully been cut from the HBO show lest it get even more complicated. Someone in the writer’s room clearly wasn’t happy with this decision, and so decided to throw in an elephant-sized easter egg for viewers who have also read the series so far.  Cersei’s need for elephants in the Game Of Thrones premiere comes directly from the books - Metro UK So, it seems like this is a special Easter-Egg for those who have read the series."
Why did Vision end up in Iron Man's team?,"TL;DR: It's specifically because he's a being of logic. Also, because of love. First and foremost, it's important to remember Vision's original statement of loyalty from Age of Ultron. He is going to side with whichever group will protect life the best. CAPTAIN AMERICA: Are you? On our side? VISION: It's not that simple. (pause) I'm on the side of life. Ultron is not. He explains that he sees logic in the oversight (all following quotes from the Civil War transcript): Vision: In the 8 years since Mr. Stark announced himself as Iron Man, the number of known enhanced persons has grown exponentially. And during the same period, the number of potentially world-ending events has risen at a commensurate rate. Steve Rogers: Are you saying it's our fault? Vision: I'm saying there may be a causality. Our very strength invites challenge. Challenge incites conflict. And conflict... breeds catastrophe. Oversight... Oversight is not an idea that can be dismissed out of hand. He loves Wanda. Actor Paul Bettany confirms this in an interview with EW. Speaking of why he accidentally blasted Rhodey out of the sky, he says “What happened there is that his judgment was clouded there by real love and affection,” says Bettany. “And he responded in a quick and thoughtless way.… I really love that the moral compass of the movie is this synthetic person who’s trying to figure out what it means to be human. It’s a neat idea, you know?” Because he loves Wanda, he believes that this is the best way to protect her. Tony Stark: If we don't do this now, it's gonna be done to us later. That's the fact. That won't be pretty. Wanda Maximoff: You're saying they'll come for me. Vision: We would protect you. He truly believes that protecting Wanda from the public is also protecting the public. Wanda Maximoff: Vision, are you not letting me leave? Vision: [He blocks her way.] It is a question of safety. Wanda Maximoff: I can protect myself. Vision: [He holds her arm.] Not yours. Mr. Stark would like to avoid the possibility of another public incident. Until the Accords are on a... more secured foundation. Wanda Maximoff: And what do you want? Vision: For people to see you... as I do. [She looks at him gravely.] and Vision: [He faulters.] If you do this... they will never stop being afraid of you. So, he decides to go the utilitarian route: the greatest good for the greatest number: Vision: Captain Rogers. I know you believe what you're doing is right. But for the collective good you must surrender now. [Tony's team arrives.] Of course, being that he is basing his allegiance on logic, he is willing to swap sides. Actor Paul Bettany addressed this briefly in the interview mentioned earlier. “He has logic in abundance. And logic does not afford any room for loyalty. New information could come to light and he might flip to Captain America’s side. But love solidifies things and provides loyalty. So if he’s there to protect mankind – or frankly, the universe – he needs to figure out what’s good about these creatures, and I think that’s the quest that you find him on. And, of course, in the comics, the relationship becomes romantic. We’ll see moving forward what happens for Vision and Wanda.”"
"Who voices the character ""Finger"" in The Fifth Element?","No official sources have talked about this, and with a movie this old, I doubt they ever will. Multiple theories exist around the web. From TheGamer: This would be because Finger was voiced by none other than Vin Diesel. Diesel went uncredited for this small role. Though Besson has stated that he does not want to make a sequel, I would be very much in favour of Finger being introduced so we can have Riddick and Korben Dallas kicking butts together on screen. The IMDB Trivia states: Who plays the voices of Finger, Korben's mother, and Mr. Shadow?
No one was credited for these roles, and there's no clear evidence as to who was used. However, some have speculated that it was Jill Mullan, who is credited under Other Crew for ""special thanks"". Others have suggested that Finger sounds like Bill Nunn or Vin Diesel but neither of these have been confirmed. In Answers, Sounds a lot like Nick Chinlund, who also starred with Bruce Willis in Tears of the Sun. And this random Imgur link states it was Glenn Fleshler: It's rumored on the 'net that it's Vin Diesel. Not that Vin wouldn't have nailed it, but it's not him.  It's this man: Glenn Fleshler. There's no conclusive answer to be found, I'm afraid."
K-PAX ending explanation,"Prot was an ET and could travel through a light beam in human body physical form but only one at a time. Hence, ""I can only take one of you"" ultimately choosing Bess.
Robert Porter was Prot's human friend before suffering mental trauma and becoming catatonic so Prot occupied his body to protect him and travel through until he could deliver him from peril after finding the right caretaker (Dr. Powell), then catching his prearranged travel timed Lightbeam Home using Bess as his human form (Vehicle), leaving Robert in safe haven with Dr. Powell. That's my synopsis. Regardless, Prot acknowledges his return to consciousness with Jeff Bridges, asking that he take care of him. To me this says that although Prot may be an alien in Robert's body, he may still maintain some of the human subconsciousness.
For these reasons I find the clues are more consistent with the possibility that he is an Alien, than he is not. Funny enough to say, it would be almost more convoluted to argue that he was human."
"What does Darth Vader think Obi-Wan's referring to when Obi says ""If you strike me down...""","Vader probably has an awareness that the Force can extend someone's consciousness beyond death in a ghost-like form. But he's not afraid of ghosts, they have no real power beyond words and cannot harm him or change his convictions. But what Vader doesn't realize is that Obi-wan's continuing guidance and mentorship of Luke is the ""power"" that he's talking about.  Vader, in this mode, is entirely self-absorbed and doesn't see this angle."
Why does Lance consider cell phones unsafe?,"Cell phones at the time were unencrypted analog signals and could be picked up by any number of modified and unmodified radio systems. Scanner radios were easy to modify to pick them up. Even a UHF tv set could pick them up. 

 Current cell phones have moved to less easily accessible radio bands, encrypted, digital signals that jump from channel to channel, time divided, or frequencies. CDMA, TDMA, and FDMA, respectively. They can't be picked up with an off the shelf consumer radio. A land line could definitely be wiretapped, but Lance likely knew his line wasn't, and the chance of an incoming line being tapped was low, and either would require a warrant and a large expenditure and good reasoning by police. But an analog cell phone wouldn't require a warrant. It's free air transmissions. Hell, look at current Stingray technology, where cops abuse the law and technology to wire tap cell phones without a warrant, on the basis that radio transmission isn't private."
Why was The LEGO Movie not nominated at the Oscars?,"Here's a Variety article on this very thing with 5 reasons: “Lego” landed just one mention — in the song category for its infectious “Everything Is Awesome” anthem — but not in the animated feature category, where many were predicting that the toon blockbuster might win. That oversight comes as a total shock to Oscar pundits — arguably the year’s biggest snub, alongside the fact that “Selma” placed in only two categories (for which theories abound). From the point of view of the animation community, however, there was always a risk. The reasons reported are as follows: The original report is here: 5 Reasons the Academy Overlooked ‘The LEGO Movie’ Looks like there is no one overriding answer, it was a combination of things.

Why was the Avengers movie called something different in the UK?,"The Avengers was given a somewhat different name because of the British TV show The Avengers.

  series of the same name, as well as its 1998 film adaptation, but this

What is rosebud?,"From Mr. Welles himself: The most basic of all ideas was that of a search for the true significance of the man’s apparently meaningless dying words. Kane was raised without a family. He was snatched from his mother’s arms in early childhood. His parents were a bank. From the point of view of the psychologist, my character had never made what is known as “transference” from his mother. Hence his failure with his wives. In making this clear during the course of the picture, it was my attempt to lead the thoughts of my audience closer and closer to the solution of the enigma of his dying words. These were “Rosebud.” The device of the picture calls for a newspaperman (who didn’t know Kane) to interview people who knew him very well. None had ever heard of “Rosebud.” Actually, as it turns out, “Rosebud” is the trade name of a cheap little sled on which Kane was playing on the day he was taken away from his home and his mother. In his subconscious it represented the simplicity, the comfort, above all the lack of responsibility in his home, and also it stood for his mother’s love which Kane never lost. source (the rest of the article is an interesting read in itself)"

Source - Wikipedia As for the ""significance"" of the sunglasses, they seem just to have been an affectation of the film's creator H. B. ""Toby"" Halicki. Toby's office was a gargantuan garage displaying toy cars, real cars and all sorts of antique bric-a-brac. If you saw ""Gone in Sixty Seconds"" you'll recall the many pairs of aviator-style sunglasses scattered about Eleanor's dashboard. In real life, it was his Rolls Royce which received the Toby treatment. Source"
Are scripts seeded to identify leaks?,"Screenrant.com WSJ’s report also contains a few interesting accounts of how recent and upcoming movies were kept under wraps. Each copy of each script for The Hunger Games adaptations has a few slightly different words, so that if it reaches the public the studio will be able to figure out exactly where the leak came from.  It's called a Canary Trap [Wikipedia Link] and it's been used for some years A canary trap is a method for exposing an information leak by giving different versions of a sensitive document to each of several suspects and seeing which version gets leaked. Special attention is paid to the quality of the prose of the unique language, in the hopes that the suspect will repeat it verbatim in the leak, thereby identifying the version of the document. As an example... ...before drafts of the screenplay for Star Trek III: The Search for Spock were circulated, Bennett arranged for each individual copy to have subtle clues distinguishing it from the others. Shortly after Roddenberry opposed the destruction of the Enterprise at the climax of that film, fans began to complain to Paramount and Bennett. He found that a leaked copy of the script was the one given to Roddenberry, but was unable to do anything about it.1 From a comment link by @Thunderforge (thanks): They are sometimes used in television is well. J. Michael Straczynski used them for a key Babylon 5 episode in 1993 to deter spoilers from getting out. This episode is going to be highly classified; we're going to limit
  distribution of scripts, and parts of scripts, put canary traps in all of the
  scripts that are distributed, and otherwise keep this one quiet. All I can
  say is that we're going to kick over every table we've got. In any season
  finale, there are maybe 4-5 things you know when you sit down to watch the
  show that they'll NEVER ever do. So we're doing all of them. If this one

Why is the ending of Forrest Gump different from the novel?,"I found a very interesting article based on the differences between movie and the novel. I'll quote some of them, that should answer your question: Robert Zemeckis, director of Forrest Gump, chooses not to include several adventures that are present in the book and to change the character’s personality. This significant changes play an important role in the viewer’s perspective of Forrest. Also he is described as a big, tall, and a really strong person while in the movie the viewer would describe him as an average man. Jenny, and Forrest’s mother are the only two people that love Forrest the way he is. In the book, however, it seems as if Forrest’s mother doesn’t take him more than just an idiot. “How you gonna have a plan, Forrest?..You is a idiot. How is po idiot gonna have a plan?”(220)  In the movie Robert Zemeckis decides to change that and makes her more confident in her son’s mental skills. However, his mental impairment doesn’t seem to bother Jenny, the love of Forrest’s life, who’s feelings toward Forrest evolve differently in the movie compare to the book. The viewer of Forrest Gump doesn’t know her real feelings and might even think that the main character is the person to whom she runs for a comfort and a place to stay until she is strong enough to run away again. This change certainly changes the viewer’s perspective on Jenny’s personality.  So basically, the director chooses a different ending because he changed the character's personality; and in order to maintain consistency in this, it's not just the ending that has been changed, as you read the book you should know better than me: some scenes were added, some of them were cut off. All these changes have been made to make the movie more touching. So I quote the answer to your question: However, the adjustments to the main heroes’s characters and the addition of several touching moments change the book into a heart breaking movie. You can read the whole article here. Enjoy."
"In opening credits for TV shows, why does it say 'with so and so' for some actors?","Contractual agreements generally requested by the actor's agent to garner him/her more recognition.

Why didn't the Dursleys make witchcraft and wizardry public?,"As you said, they hate Harry. They want to be away from him as much as possible, and all he represents (i.e., Wizardry). The Dursleys want to be normal above all else. They want to be regarded as successful, but anything crazy sounding is a big no-no for them. Mr and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They live much better by ignoring Harry and pretending he doesn't exist at all. The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover [...] about the Potters. Also, who would believe them if they said Wizards existed? No one. Child protective services would arrive much sooner than a squad of scientists to study poor Harry."
Why did Arya not kill the Lannister soldiers she encountered in the Riverlands?,"Arya's action (or lack of) was to humanize her character. It's to show she still has a soft side. She hasn't reached Cersei's level of crazy yet. At this point in time, Arya had just wiped out the entire Frey Family, leaving only the women behind. Now, killing these harmless soldiers would have no point. They offered Arya food, and also told her their situation: they had no choice but to serve the Lannisters. Not everyone who serves the Lannisters is evil, that's what Arya got from her conversation with the soldiers. That's the point of that scene, both humanizing the soldiers and showing that the soft side of Arya is not lost, yet."

  ... so, the studio was in a panic. And director John McTiernan commented: They took him off the poster about a month before the movie came out. So the studio made a poster featuring just the building.  Only after the movie proved to be a box office hit, did they put Bruce Willis' face back on the poster.

Why does Mycroft call the US a colony even after it achieved independence?,"No this is not a mistake. It's just a British form of derogatory humour to continue to refer to the US as ""the Colonies"". It's not something that would be used in everyday speech to refer to America but if the speaker wanted to imply that the US was in some way ""lesser"" they would put it down by using the term...as in former colonies, as though the War of Independence had never happened. For the same reason, Americans are sometimes referred to by the British as ""colonial cousins"" and Australians as ""convicts"". It's not intended to be offensive, just mildly (and perhaps humourously) insulting."
Why was Bruce Wayne so harsh/rude when he asked for everyone to leave his party?,"He decided that being rude was the fastest way to get people to leave.  If he had politely asked it is very likely that a lot of people would have hung around to try to talk to him.  Equally if he had claimed that he was busy it would still have been weird to kick everybody out. Bear in mind that he lives in a mansion and part of the point of living in a mansion is that you can have a big space for public parties and still have plenty of private space for yourself.  If he claimed that some businesses thing had suddenly come up the normal thing would be  to say 'sorry I've been called away, enjoy the party'. It's not like he has to serve the food himself or turf people out of his bedroom so he can use his phone in private.  By being rude he removes the incentive for people to want to stay.  In terms of the meta-narrative this also represents the point where he stops leading a double life and the Batman persona becomes dominant over the Bruce Wayne one ie keeping up the facade of Bruce Wayne is less important to him than his activities as Batman so Bruce Wayne as a reclusive and unapproachable placeholder is just more convenient and means that he doesn't have to put much effort into 'pretending' to be BW anymore.  To put it another way this is the point where it is BW rather than batman which is the facade which is also the reason why his relationship with Rachel breaks down. "
Why are the landscape shots in Sherlock so blurry?,"BCdotWEB's answer does an excellent job of explaining how this effect is done, and I just wanted to chime in a little about a possible why. Tilt-shift is used to make real life, full-sized landscapes look like miniature models: people appear as dolls, massive buildings become nothing more than toys. A major theme throughout the Sherlock BBC series is how Sherlock's incredible analytical mind leaves him struggling to relate to others as fellow humans rather than puzzles to be solved, and his analytical skills often takes him into conflict with larger-than-life villains (such as Moriarty) who openly view other humans as nothing more than toys to play with and discard. Looking at the series through this lens, the tilt shift effect turning London into a model set filled with living dolls can be interpreted as a way to metaphorically show the city through the perspective of the geniuses, good and evil, who the series revolves around."
Why did Ripley burn the eggs after she rescued Newt?,"If memory serves: It was when the egg opened that Ripley nodded her head as if to say ""oh hell no!"", and then the shooting began. It seems to me that the queen had no intention of letting Ripley and Newt go, but had every intention to cocoon both. That plan back fired (pardon the pun). This clip around 2:38 shows the moment in question:

What is the perception of Tyrion's story about his cousin Orson and the beetles?,"Orson kills beetles.  The Mountain kills women and children.  In fact, a good many people around Tyrion are killers.  Even his brother Jaime who's, at this point, generally considered to be a good dude totally pushed a kid out a window and had all of Ned's servants killed in S1. Tyrion could not understand the beetle murder habit of Orson's because Tyrion is not a natural killer. He just doesn't have the stomach for the casual relationship with death that so many others in Westeros do.  Life is cheap in this world, but the one character who doesn't feel that way is Tyrion.  You'll notice he picked up a bug during that monologue and at the end he let it go. Dude just isn't made for this world."
Why are certain alcoholic drinks sometimes placed in a paper bag?,"It's to do with US drinking/alcohol laws. Apparently it's illegal to carry open containers of alcohol, so by placing it inside a brown paper bag, this claims ""it's not open"" and ""I'm not really drinking it"". The brown bag would be the one the store placed it in at purchase. I don't know whether this is an actual law across all 50 States or whether it has just become 'movie shorthand' to explain why an outdoor drinker might 'have a problem with alcohol' sufficient that they can't wait til they get home, or that they don't have a home to take it to."
"Why is ""The Matrix"" called by that name?","Originally, matrix meant a womb, echoing the womb-like pods Neo and the others are kept in.  The science fiction meaning, however, is more recent, found in Doctor Who's Deadly Assassin (1976) as an equivalent of cyberspace: How can you intercept thought patterns within the matrix itself? Or as a VR-world in Gibson's Neuromancer (1984): He'd operated on an almost permanent adrenaline high ... jacked into a custom cyberspace deck that projected his disembodied consciousness into the consensual hallucination that was the matrix. And in modern times, a matrix is a common computer science and mathematics term. It is a rectangular array of numbers, and computers operate using matrices in an absurd number of operations (including rendering the pixels in which you are reading these words). The movie franchise is fairly ambiguous, but intuitively, I've always assumed the matrix represented the computer-world in which humanity now lived. They are trapped in that array of numbers which controls all their inputs and outputs."
Why didn't the producers offer Ridley Scott the chance to direct the 2nd Alien movie?,"From alienseries, the producer blamed it on availability: In 1986 Bobbie Wygant asked Aliens producer Gale Anne Hurd if Scott had turned down the opportunity to direct the sequel. “I’m not really sure,” Hurd answered. “I know that he was in post-production on Legend at the time we were in pre-production [on Aliens], so perhaps it was a result of his availability.” But that wasn't true: “They didn’t ask me!” he told The Hollywood Interview in 2008. “To this day I have no idea why. It hurt my feelings, really, because I thought we did quite a good job on the first one.” There are some rumors circulating around but nothing definitive."
Would a DeLorean actually break apart into a million pieces if hit by a freight train?,"Yes. A few points. Real, better cars get destroyed all the time (for instance).  

 The DeLorean has always been known as a fairly weak car. Its construction and crash survivability is pretty low. It had a Fiberglass chassis when most cars were still fully metal. Remember in the previous movie, Marty wanted the Doc to block the tunnel with the flying DeLorean,  Doc says it would be shred to pieces by a 50s Ford metal truck. The DeLorean has an unknown number of modifications, both as a time machine as well as a flying car for weight. And in the west as well. It was modified so the train could push it to 88 mph. IIRC or IMHO that probably would include ditching the now useless gas engine, again for weight. Doc used parts of it to make ice. So it's missing parts. Dead on the tracks, head on.  Unlike most train on car collisions, which are T bones. "
Who was the fifth one that was killed by Harvey Dent in The Dark Knight?,"The fifth one isn't someone that Harvey Dent killed. It's Harvey himself. The ""five people"" dead that Commissioner Gordon is referring to here are (in chronological order); There are other interpretations of this line elsewhere on the web (some people think that Sal Maroni's bodyguard is the fifth, and others think it's the bartender in the bar where Michael Wuertz is killed), but as far as I can tell this is the only interpretation that fulfills the ""two of them cops"" part of Commissioner Gordon's line."
Why are portkeys not used for long-distance travel?,"I've just come across this explanation in the book ""Quidditch Through the Ages"" .. page 90: ""Too cumbersome to turn at high speed, the Oakshaft [79] never gained
  much popularity with those who prized agility over safety, though it
  will always be remembered as the broom used in the first ever Atlantic
  broom crossing, by Jocunda Skyes in 1935. (Before that time, wizards
  preferred to take ships rather than trust broomsticks over such
  distances. Apparation becomes increasingly unreliable over very long
  distances, and only highly skilled wizards are wise to attempt it
  across continents.)"" -  Quidditch Through the Ages Looking at this, since Newt went to America in 1920s, it would be safe to assume he did not use other means of transport for this reason.  Similarly, portkeys are unpleasant to travel.. cause nausea and giddiness making it not exactly travel-friendly all the time.  The next reason is that portkeys between continents need to be approved by both the ministries and these are monitored. When Newt is bringing a suitcase full of beasts, I think he would try and maintain a low key with MACUSA (which has quite strict rules and regulations) - HP Wikia"
What was so different about “Night of the Living Dead” from previous zombie movies?,"Prior to that film, zombies were slaves to others: Either people who were hypnotized or drugged to become slaves to local “sorcerers”; known as bokor in Haitian folklore. Or they were literal slaves that killed themselves and —  as a result — were trapped in a “limbo”-like existence as a zombie; cursed to never really live and never really die. Simply put, George A. Romero’s Night of the Living Dead (1968) was a reflection of the society at the time: A society in the late 1960s that reflected freedom and individualism over having to answer to others. The zombies in that film were slaves to nobody and were created by some radiation — seemingly everything in the world of 1960s sci-fi and fantasy were created by radiation — that just… BOOM reanimated the dead and gave them the freedom to wander aimlessly and eat others. Prior to Night of the Living Dead, zombies were slaves to others in one way or another. This article in The Atlantic (“The Tragic, Forgotten History of Zombies” by Mike Mariani, October 28, 2015) explains it quite well; bold emphasis is mine: “The original brains-eating fiend was a slave not to the flesh of others but to his own. The zombie archetype, as it appeared in Haiti and mirrored the inhumanity that existed there from 1625 to around 1800, was a projection of the African slaves’ relentless misery and subjugation. Haitian slaves believed that dying would release them back to lan guinée, literally Guinea, or Africa in general, a kind of afterlife where they could be free. Though suicide was common among slaves, those who took their own lives wouldn’t be allowed to return to lan guinée. Instead, they’d be condemned to skulk the Hispaniola plantations for eternity, an undead slave at once denied their own bodies and yet trapped inside them—a soulless zombie.” This echoes in the plot of White Zombie (1932), where a couple — planning to be married — meet up with an evil voodoo master: Murder Legendre. The film is set on a plantation owned by Murder Legendre and Murder (what a name, right?) promises the husband (Charles) the best way to convince his gal pal (Madeleine) to marry him is to make her a zombie. Of course you can’t trust a guy literally named “Murder” so not only does he make Madeleine a zombie, but also makes Charles a zombie. And guess who does all the work on this Murder guy’s plantation? Tons of zombies of his own creation! So the simple way to understand it all is:"
"Was ""Tim"" the enchanter an ad-libbed name?","tl;dr; For all intents and purposes, the rumour that John Cleese ad-libbed the name of 'Tim the Enchanter' is completely false. I found something that purports to be a working copy of the script used in the production of the film, complete with on-the-fly revisions. This is the 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' screenplay as it appeared on March 20, 1974. It's a 'working' version of the script., NOT the final script that was filmed. In reading this, you'll be able to see the creative process at work. Many of the scenes were altered from the way they were originally written and others disappeared entirely. Other bits, including some of the funniest and most quoted lines from the film were written into this version of the script, and others were added in later on during filming. I've color-coded the changes so you can follow them more easily. source: Holy Grail Working Script Part 3 That predates the theatrical release of the film (April 13, 1975) by at least a year. This version of the script has color-coded Cleese's line as BLACK: Regular text. The way the script was originally written. ARTHUR: By what name are you known? TIM: There are some who call me Tim? ARTHUR: Greetings Tim the Enchanter! unabridged source: Holy Grail Working Script Part 3 If this version of the script's provenance is correct then not only is the line spoken exactly as it later appeared in the released film but the character attribution for the spoken line is Tim. This evidence coupled with John Cleese's own dismissal of the rumour would seem to prove the rumour false. John Cleese has shown over the years to be a consummate professional and one of the best examples of a straight man in modern comedy. He has exhibited time and again that he can weather the most hilarious situations with a complete deadpan expression while delivering his own lines on cue and per direction. I can see how he might forget a line of dialogue irregularly but would he ever forget which character he was portraying or whose costume and makeup he was wearing?           John Cleese as Tim the Enchanter I think not. IMHO, John Cleese would never come on set so unprepared. I have no idea how the rumour got started nor how any internet rumour gets started. My best guess would be Cleese's comic delivery of the line in question and the subsequent hesitation of the other party. Per the implied stage direction in the script¹, he ends it with a quizzical upnote as if he was asking a question, not stating fact. The comedic effect is putting Arthur and his followers ill at ease; they don't know whether to answer in the affirmative or accept his response. Some fan-boy might have obsessed on the lilted delivery and started a rumour that Cleese was in fact asking who he was supposed to be playing. ¹ The ? at the end of Tim's dialog line (which is notably missing in the OP's version of the script) is the scriptwriters' way of directing the dialogue line to be delivered as a question rather than a statement."
Why would Luke Skywalker be a myth?,"30 years is a long time. A whole generation is born and has become adults. Some of them might already have children. And Order 66 was even 20 years before that. The memory of the Jedi has faded. I'm often astonished about how little young people know about history - in my case, about the struggles in Germany after WWII, about the division of Germany in two and about the struggles for families that were on both sides of the border. Just this year it was the 30th anniversary of the re-unification, and the memory is already fading -- in an highly interconnected world where media access is ubiquitous. Rey is living on a third-world planet, is poor and struggles with making enough money for food. It is surprising she has heard of Luke at all. And its really not surprising that she takes the stories about this great hero who she never saw, who can allegedly do magic with a hefty grain of salt. She has never seen anyone do magic, why should she believe that it does actually exist? Because from her PoV, ""The Force"" is nothing more than a fancy word for ""magic"". Remember what Admiral Motti said? Admiral Motti : Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebels' hidden fort... [Vader makes a pinching motion and Motti starts choking] Darth Vader : I find your lack of faith disturbing. From https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/characters/nm0376405 Vader is a prominent figure in the Empire, to put it mildly, and that is in EP IV (BBY 0), so Order 66 was executed only 19 years prior. Motti is clearly old enough to remember the Jedi and Order 66, and even he doesn't really seem to believe what Vader can do -- prompting the latter to use Motti for a little demonstration. Or what Han said in EP IV? Han Solo : Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. From https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/characters/nm0000148 He clearly doesn't believe The Force is real -- and he is well travelled and a lot better informed than Rey. Luke also wasn't much of a public figure. He was a pilot, not a general, unlike Han, who got promoted to that rank prior to the Battle of Endor and went on to become the husband of Leia Organa, who played a rather prominent role in the Rebel Alliance and later New Republic. @Juhasz puts it very nicely in a comment: Yes, he fired the photon torpedo that blew up the first Death Star - but without looking, what's the name of the pilot who dropped the atom bomb on Hiroshima? He was a guerrilla fighter in the battle of the second Death Star and was present for the death of the Emperor (though there were probably no living witnesses of this). Why would anyone aside from a history buff know any of this? Given these facts, and that its 30 years later, I don't find it surprising at all that Rey thinks Luke is a myth. If I had only her information, I'd probably think so, too."

Why don't they align actor & actress names with their photos in film posters?,"It is probably a combination of the decisions of graphic designers (who may not agree with you that there is necessarily a 'proper' way to do this).  Plus the order of names in credits and posters is carefully negotiated in contracts with the stars. In the example above Nick Stahl probably got top billing, and negotiated his name to be first in all marketing, and then the graphic designers and marketing people wanted to put both the main star in the center of the poster, and slightly larger, and framed by the two women. They probably could have put Nick Stahl's name above the others and complied with the contracts, but a graphic design decision was made that the order of the names was unimportant compared to the overall look of the poster."

Why are Frozen's Elsa and Anna excluded from the Disney Princesses franchise?,"Being a Disney Princess is not just a matter of being a princess from a Disney property, it's a question of marketing. The collection of Disney Princesses is used together in other materials, things like direct-to-video releases, books, games, etc. There's an article on a Disney Wikia that has some more details, but that's the gist of it. Frozen was such a success, that Anna and Elsa got their own marketing segment:
 Disney Frozen. At some point, the popularity of the sisters may go down and one or both may get rolled into the ""Princess"" marketing machine."
Is there any reason why mostly technology deprived planets are pictured in the Star Wars movies?,"Frankly, Lucas wanted giant mega cities and shiny tech everywhere. But Money and Technology just wasn't there at the time.
According to wikipedia: The concept of a city planet in the Star Wars universe originated with the initial drafts of Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. The planet was called Alderaan, and much of the action in the film transpired on it. Since building such a city would be prohibitively expensive, much of what was to take place on the planet was moved to the Death Star, and Alderaan became the name of Princess Leia's home planet. The Empire's homeworld, Had Abaddon, came up in early drafts of Return of the Jedi. The entire planet was to be a sprawling city. However, concluding that the realization of such a city was (still) impossible at the time, the creators abandoned the idea. The idea of city planets, i.e. a planet so urbanized and technologically changed that the entire planet is a single city, was eventually shown as Coruscant, the Republic mega-city-planet in the 1997 special edition of Return of the Jedi, and eventually the Prequel Trilogy. Lucas himself confirmed it in an interview about Illustrated Light & Magic special effects studio: “It was like a giant switch was thrown overnight,” Ed Catmull says about Jurassic Park’s effect on Hollywood. CG began to spread everywhere, with movies being green-lit on the strength of a single test shot. Projects once thought impossible became possible—and for Lucas, that meant his long-imagined but never-realized Star Wars prequels. LUCAS: I never thought I’d do the Star Wars prequels, because there was no real way I could get Yoda to fight. There was no way I could go over Coruscant, this giant city-planet. But once you had digital, there was no end to what you could do. And that's why we got the Prequels and their cg eyesores wonders of digital technology."

Meaning of the final room in 2001: A Space Odyssey,"The ending is largely symbolic, and reading the book helps with its interpretation. Here are some different opinions. The one based on the book goes like this: The black monolith you saw in the beginning of the film, and the one found buried on the moon, were placed there by a supremely advanced alien race as a way to nudge along the evolution of humanity. The first encounter with a monolith gave our ancient ancestors the knowledge of how to use tools. Next, the one on the moon pointed us farther out into space, toward Jupiter (and may have given us the ability to create artificial intelligence i.e., HAL, which was another massive leap in technology). Finally, Dave reaches the third monolith and is transformed into the next stage of human evolution, the Star Child seen in the final shot. The psychedelic light show before that represents the vast knowledge being given to him by the monolith, which our minds can't even comprehend (and also, possibly, him being transported across enormous oceans of time and space). Another source gives something similar: After Dave points to the monolith he is transformed into the Starchild which is a glowing, fetus like being but also has the appearance of a man in the face. After this scene Dave is sent back to Earth by the monolith and the film ends as Dave, now the Starchild, looks on at our planet. The reason the Starchild was sent back to Earth is because the monolith has completed its duty of advancing human life to its evolutionary limits so it sent the Starchild back to continue its work. In the last 30 minutes of the film Dave is given all the knowledge of the universe and has been transformed into an immortal, all knowing being. Dave is now the film's version of God sent back to advance his race further than they ever could have by themselves. However, Kubrick himself admits that you're free to speculate as you wish about the philosophical and allegorical meaning of the film so there may not be a definite answer. Some theories even say that the screen itself is a monolith, where the audience is drawn to."
How was Jon Snow able to kill the White Walker in S05E08?,"His sword is from Valyrian steel, which also can kill White Walkers: Valyrian steel is the only thing that can kill White Walkers, alongside dragonglass, although this property is not widely known, apparently, not even to the White Walkers themselves. This has been mentioned in the books, but not in the previous episodes of the show: In ""A Feast for Crows"", Sam Tarly tells Jon about old annals claiming
  that dragonsteel (perhaps a synonym of Valyrian steel) is lethal to
  the Others, like dragonglass. In the show, this is confirmed when Jon
  Snow kills a White Walker during the battle of Hardhome. In the
  novels, however, it has not been put to test yet. In the episode 10 of season 5:  Jon and Sam are discussing the event described in the question  and they agree that Jon's sword
 Longclaw was able to
 kill the White Walker because it's made from Valyrian steel."
When did each Horcrux get destroyed in the Harry Potter movies?,"The Horcrux hunt was a mission given to Harry Potter in June of 1997 to find all of Lord Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes and destroy them. The mission fell to Harry Potter to complete. He was joined by Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, and they set off in the aftermath of Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour's wedding. Lord Voldemort's had only seven Horcruxes: Voldemort also retained part of his soul inside him. They eventually destroyed all of the Horcruxes by 2 May 1998. The hunt ended with the death of Lord Voldemort at the hands of Harry Potter at the end of the Battle of Hogwarts and this is in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2
 I hope harrypotter.wikia.com has plenty of well constructed resources. According to Albus Dumbledore, Lord Voldemort created seven horcruxes. Throughout the books and movies, five out of the seven that he created had been destroyed. Harry Potter was an accidental horcrux. According to Dumbledore seven horcrux were created before the killing of Harry Potter's parents, so Harry would have been the 8th horcrux. The snake was a horcrux at a later time seeing how the snake never existed during the time that the first horcruxes were created. Dumbledore said that there was one horcrux in each house of Hogwarts. The horcrux related to the house of Gryffindor was never found."
What led to Firefly's cancellation?,"Several factors led to the demise of Firefly, but ultimately it was a colossal mistake by Fox executives.  The series was played at an unfavorable time slot, and to compound this, Fox decided to play the episodes out of order, insisting that the 'better' episodes play first. Naturally, this meant there was some confusion on the audience's part. Former Fox Entertainment president Gail Berman gives a little insight into the decision in this interview she gave to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.  At the end of the day though, it was a short-sighted decision that should haunt the Fox executives to this day. It's not the first time they've done this though - look at Family Guy."
Why did the ring affect Frodo so much and not Bilbo?,"I think the two main reasons behind this are: That Sauron is slowly increasing his powers over the whole timeline of the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings - the stories of which take place over an 80 year period.   That Bilbo never receives the attention of Sauron in quite the same way that Frodo does. Bilbo's 111th birthday party which starts the story of the Lord of the Rings, and where Bilbo gives the ring to Frodo, takes place about 60 years after the events of The Hobbit.  A further 18 years elapses before Frodo starts to bear the ring towards Mordor to destroy it. In the distant past, Sauron was defeated by Isildur and thought to be destroyed, however he is slowly rebuilding his power for literally hundreds of years under the guise of being The Necromancer of Dol Guldur. Sauron does not even openly declare himself until about 10 years after Bilbo finds the ring, and he believes the ring has been lost in the area he was defeated by Isildur.   So at the time that Bilbo owns the ring, Sauron is not as powerful, and he believes the ring is lost and is searching for it in the wrong area. In Tolkien's writings, Bilbo's party is in S.R. (Shire Reckoning) 1401.  It is not until some time between 1409 and 1417 that Gollum (venturing into Mordor seeking the ring himself) is captured by Sauron.  Since Gollum is released only a year before the Nazgul actively start seeking for ""Baggins"" one can guess that it is likely that this happens towards the end of this time period. So it is well after Bilbo is no longer the owner and active user of the ring that Sauron starts to seek him.  Frodo obeys Gandalf's recommendations and does not use the ring in this period, and breaks this for the first time 'accidentally' in the Prancing Pony very briefly, and does not seem to suffer particularly from the experience. It is when he is attacked by the Nazgul on Weathertop that he first starts to see things - and even then it is primarily the nearby Nazgul that can sense and see him - not Sauron yet from his tower hundreds of miles away. Also Bilbo stays in the Shire with the ring whereas Frodo brings the ring ever closer to Sauron in the attempt to destroy it, so its possible the closer he comes to Mordor the more powerful and corruptive a hold it gains on Frodo.

Why do you need 6 points to define a location in 3 dimensional space?,"I'm sorry but most of the answers here are incorrect.  The original observation made by the person asking the question is correct.  In 3 dimensional space, only three unique co-ordinates are needed to describe an objects exact location relative to a known point of origin. A good real-life example of this, which proves that point - is that GPS devices are designed to track your location with a minimum of three satellite signals in range.  GPS co-ordinates do use more satellites than that to improve accuracy, but that is not because having more reference co-ordinates makes them more accurate, it is because having more RADIO signals reduces the impact of noise and other interference on the that distorts one of the signals it is tracking. Imagine your assistant is sitting in the backseat on the passenger side of your car, and you need to tell him  the exact location of a cup of coffee you left on your dash board.  You could use the following reference co-ordinates: Front Bumper (X axis coordinate)
Drivers side-view mirror (Y axis coordinate)
Windshield Wipers (Z axis coordinate) Now, from the passenger side back seat if you were to move your hand towards all three of those object, without moving past any of them, you will arrive at a location that sits in front of you, at the height of the windshield wipers, in the direction of the driver's seat, and that would be the dashboard of the vehicle in the corner closest to the driver's window.  Adding 3 more reference points would not make it any more accurate, because it doesn't matter how many directions you measure from, as long as you have enough reference points to choose from. However, I think that 3 million possible address combinations and 38 reference points is accurate enough when you are talking about galactic travel.  If more accurate was needed, they would have to use symbols on the gates, but the addresses would still only need 3 symbols and a point of origin to work! For those of you who believe the other answers that argue that 6 points plus a point of reference is logical; I can understand why you might come to that conclusion but you are over thinking it... and you are wrong.  If you were to eliminate the point of origin from the equation, then you would need to 6 coordinates, just because you would need 3 coordinates for each point (one set for your point of origin and one set for your destination).  Hollywood obviously did not understand the math, and misinterpreted how coordinates work in three dimension space.   Another way you can see how illogical that would be, would be to take a two dimensional map and mark two points... then figure out how to describe the position of one point relative to the other.  According to Stargate logic, you would need one coordinate for your point of origin, and then four points for the destination (one point on each side of the destination forming a square, instead of the cube they used in the movie for 3 dimensional space).  I promise, when you are done, you will feel pretty stupid.  It won't take you more than a couple seconds to realize that finding four reference points to describe one location on a 2 Dimensional map is completely stupid. And for those of you who are die-hard over thinkers, you do not need an agreed center or universal axis, or reference orientation to make this work using one coordinate per dimension, plus your point of origin; as long as you ensure that every destination has at least three reference points around it which are all further away from the destination than they are to the point of origin (I won't get into the math or explain that part in detail, but the reason is that you need to draw three separate vectors going all the way past the destination from three different angles, so that the distance between the object remains equal to the distance between the point of origin and the intersection of the three points)."
Was Bugs Bunny impersonating someone when he ate the carrot?,"After looking into it, I found this on wikipedia: Bugs Bunny's nonchalant carrot-chewing standing position, as explained by Chuck Jones, Friz Freleng, and Bob Clampett, originated in a scene in the film It Happened One Night, in which Clark Gable's character leans against a fence, eating carrots rapidly and talking with his mouth full to Claudette Colbert's character. This scene was well known while the film was popular, and viewers at the time likely recognized Bugs Bunny's behavior as satire. And this "
What was Varys trying to do at the beginning of S08E05?,"Note the part of the conversation where he asks Martha what he's told her and she replies: Martha: The greater the risk, the greater the reward. Game of Thrones, Season 8 Episode 5, ""The Bells"" If all they were trying to do was feed Dany there would be no risk and she wouldn't be concerned about the soldiers watching her because it is their job. On top of that it was already implied in the previous episode that Varys was going to attempt to kill her in his conversation with Tyrion. You've got to remember the facial expressions each character gives the other in the below conversation too. Varys: You know where my loyalty stands. You know I will never betray the realm. Tyrion: What is the realm? A vast continent, home to millions of people, most of whom don't care who sits on the Iron Throne. Varys: Millions of people, many of whom will die if the wrong person sits on that throne. We don't know their names, but they're just as real as you and I. They deserve to live. They deserve food for their children. I will act in their interest, no matter the personal cost. Tyrion: So, what happens to her? Please. Don't. Varys: I've spoken as honestly as I can. Each of us has a choice to make. I pray we choose wisely. Game of Thrones, Season 8 Episode 4, ""The Last of the Starks"""
Why this turn in Shae's character?,"TL;DR: It is unclear for how long Shae and Tywin have been involved.

A good question and one which requires an in-depth analysis!
This issue has been discussed at length in a few locations: It is hypothesised and re-butted that Tywin knew Shae all along and planted her with Tyrion. But let's do our own analysis here.
 What we know for sure, is that Shae was found in the tent of an unnamed ""knight"" and the details seem to be a little bit shady: “Where did you find her?” Tyrion asked him as he pissed.
  “I took her from a knight. The man was loath to give her up, but your name changed his thinking somewhat... that, and my dirk at his throat.”...Did you perchance note the name of this knight you took her from? I’d rather not have him beside me in the battle.”
  Bronn rose, cat-quick and cat-graceful, turning his sword in his hand. “You’ll have me beside you in the battle, dwarf.”-A Song of Ice and Fire: Book One - A Game of Thrones, Chapter Sixty-Three (Tyrion VIII). It's definitely possible that Bronn just doesn't know who this knight actually is, or care. Before all of this Tyrion mentions that he was given a 'body servant' by Tywin - there's no information on what a 'body servant' actually is or why Tywin has sent them for Tyrion. In the same paragraph, Tyrion meets and describes Shae: Lord Tywin had sent him a groom and a body servant to see to his needs, and even insisted he take a squire. They were seated around the embers of a small cookfire. A girl was with them; slim, dark-haired, no more than eighteen by the look of her. Tyrion studied her face for a moment, before he spied fishbones in the ashes.-A Song of Ice and Fire: Book One - A Game of Thrones, Chapter Sixty-Three (Tyrion VIII).[emphases mine] Tyrion then asks Shae herself about who she was with before him: He asked her about the man Bronn had taken her from, and she named the minor retainer of an insignificant lordling. “You need not fear his like, m’lord,” the girl said, her fingers busy at his cock. “He is a small man.”-A Song of Ice and Fire: Book One - A Game of Thrones, Chapter Sixty-Three (Tyrion VIII).[emphases mine] But if the person was so insignificant, then how and why was she with him? Bronn himself says that he had to fight for Shae because all the pretty ones were 
taken: “Splendid,” Tyrion said dryly, shaking off the last drops. “I seem to recall saying find me a whore, not make me an enemy.”
  “The pretty ones were all claimed,” Bronn said. “I’ll be pleased to take her back if you’d prefer a toothless drab.”Tyrion limped closer to where he sat. “My lord father would call that insolence, and send you to the mines for impertinence.”
  “Good for me you’re not your father,” Bronn replied. “I saw one with boils all over her nose. Would you like her?”-A Song of Ice and Fire: Book One - A Game of Thrones, Chapter Sixty-Three (Tyrion VIII).[emphases mine] Ok, it then becomes a little bit more suspicious when Tywin turns up knowing everything there is to know about Tyrion and Shae, even though Tyrion has done his best to keep her secret. Lord Tywin himself is not without his secrets. It is also hypothesised that he frequented brothels himself. If you remember Varys showing Tyrion a secret passage from the Tower of The Hand to Chataya's brothel, he mentioned a 'previous Hand'; well, many people believe this to have been Tywin: [Tyrion]“How is it a brothel happens to have a secret entrance?”
  [Varys]“The tunnel was dug for another King’s Hand, whose honor would not allow him to enter such a house openly. Chataya has closely guarded the knowledge of its existence.”-A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Two - A Storm of Swords, Chapter Sixteen (Tyrion III). Many speculate that Tywin frequented brothels to fill the void of his loss of his wife Joanna. But he only ever did it secretly. The author of the books, George R.R. Martin has been asked about this before, and he says: I won't comment on the Tyrion / Tywin issue. Perhaps future volumes will throw more light on it.-http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/2999 This most probably means that it is inconsequential to the story. There's not enough conclusive evidence either way. I'm hoping that since in the TV-Show, they didn't include Tysha's story, that hopefully during Tyrion's time in Pentos and the rest of Essos that he will elaborate whether or not Shae was with Tywin from the beginning or just from after Tyrion's charges. Tywin certainly didn't seem too fussed that Tyrion killed Shae, both in the show as well as in the books... After all she was only a whor... THRUM! The crux of it seems to be that Shae saw an opportune moment to dump Tyrion and go straight for the source of the Lannister wealth!"
Why are 3D films so dark?,"In 3D films, the 3D glasses are the reason for the dimness.Because the 3-D glasses are darkly coated with polarized filter that decode the images and give them depth dim. I've found a good link and let me summarize the stuff from that site. It's hard to fix the dimness in 3D movies. “Inception” director Christopher Nolan joined the 3D naysayers, saying that he refused to make his new film in the format largely because of the darkness problem. According to Nolan; “On a technical level, it’s fascinating,”, “but on an experiential level, I find the dimness of the image extremely alienating.” The 3D process, Nolan said; makes “a massive difference” in the brightness of the image. “You’re not aware of it because once you’re in that world, your eye compensates – but having struggled for years to get theaters get up to the proper brightness, we're not sticking polarized filters in everything."" You cannot see so dimness in Avatar 3D, because Avatar was shot in 3D using techniques that boosted the amount of light and compensated for the darkening process to come, was screened at light levels about half of a run-of-the-mill 2D film."
How did the T-Rex kill everyone on the boat?,"I recently watched this and thought exactly the same thing. Looking into it a bit it seems the scene showing veloceraptors boarding the boat was scraped. Which makes sense - that whole last 30 minutes seemed out of place! This from The Lost World: Jurrasic Park's IMDB page: The script called for a scene where the Velociraptors got on board the
  Venture as it was about to set sail. As chaos ensued, the T-Rex also
  got loose, and killed everything else aboard. This explains why many
  of the crew members are dead in places the Rex cannot reach. The scene
  was never filmed."
Why was Prowse chosen to play Darth Vader?,"In 1971, Stanley Kubrick cast him as Julian, the bodyguard of Mr. Alexander for A Clockwork Orange. And when such a great director casts you, it is a big thing. So for Star Wars, he did not even have an audition, George Lucas wanted him to have a role. 
David Prowse as Julian carrying Malcom McDowell in a Clockwork Orange David Prowse says: George Lucas was casting about and had heard favourable things about
  my work in Clockwork Orange and asked me to come in, which of course I
  did even though no one knew what the film was about! It is also said that George Lucas gave him a choice whether he wants to play Chewbacca or Darth Vader."
How did Arya manage to disguise herself?,"Contrary to KharoBangdo's reasoning, I would theorize that Arya snuck up on the Night King in one of two different ways. To get some other details out of the way, looking at the scene, I do not believe her flight angle is correct to imagine that she has been hiding in a tree this whole time, waiting for the Night King to approach. Yes, the screen is slightly tilted up from Bran's perspective, but as Arya is in flight, she seems to be flying straight for the Night King - and the momentum shift slightly before they make contact (and when the Night King catches her) makes it seem much more like horizontal momentum. Anyway, here's really the detail that I think blows the whole 'waiting in a tree thing out of the water' - You'll notice in the scene just prior to Arya revealing herself, one of the White Walkers notices something. The Walker feels a breeze, and you can see the Walker's hair get blown slightly (either by the wind or someone moving swiftly by). The Walker then looks to the right, as if the breeze came from there (or something / someone passed there). This detail leads me to two theories: That breeze was produced by Arya sneaking by. It's unclear whether or not she was making her dash straight to the Night King then or if she was making a dash through the tree line to remain relatively unseen while she approached (before making her big run up through the open ground). Perhaps some of her training from Jaqen was used here to be 'invisible' on her approach. A little more far fetched, but not out of the question. The Walker is Arya, who simply feels a breeze and looks to the right. Arya is borrowing the Walker's face to blend in and get close to the Night King. The breeze (and the subsequent look) are an indication that something is about to happen - or perhaps that the time is right. I think #1 is more likely, though I do hope they reveal a bit more about how this scene unfolded. Would be interesting to hear (or see) the scene from Arya's perspective. At the very least, I do feel like there is some level of significance from that subtle breeze and motion the Walker makes just prior to the Night King dying. The sound of wind blowing rises up slightly over the dramatic music, and I'd like to think that was a purposeful touch."
The cow in Apocalypse Now,"The animal (a water buffalo, or carabao) was killed - but not for the film.  The tribe in the film was a real indigenous tribe that lived in the area, and they had already decided to slaughter it. Coppola merely decided to film the event. The buffalo was already marked for ritual sacrifice by the indigenous tribe cast as the disciples of Brando’s gone-native Colonel Kurtz, and the argument was that it would have been hacked to death whether or not the cameras were rolling.
  -  AV Club I'm not familiar with animal welfare laws in the jungles of the Philippines in the late 1970's, but the water buffalo belonged to the tribe, and this is simply how they slaughtered their livestock.  By all indications, there were no laws preventing them from doing so, nor was it illegal for Coppola to film them doing it.   Even today, it seems that an indigenous tribe like the Ifugaos would be able to conduct a similar slaughter of carabao: SECTION 6. It shall be unlawful for any person to torture any animal, to neglect to provide adequate care, sustenance or shelter, or maltreat any animals or to subject any dog or horse to dogfights or horse fights, kill or cause or procure to be tortured or deprived of adequate care sustenance or shelter, or maltreat or use the same in research or experiments not expressly authorized by the Committee on Animal welfare. The killing of any animal other than cattle, pigs, goats, sheep, poultry, rabbits, carabao, horse, deer and crocodiles is likewise hereby declared unlawful except in the following instances: 1. When it is done as part of the religious rituals of an established religion or sect or ritual required by ethnic custom of indigenous cultural communities: however, leaders shall keep records in cooperation with the Committee on Animal Welfare...
  -  Republic Act No. 8485:  An Act To Promote Animal Welfare In The Philippines, Otherwise Known As “the Animal Welfare Act Of 1998”1 However, the Wikipedia article for the movie says that it may have been illegal under U.S. law, because the film was an American production: Although this was an American production subject to American animal cruelty laws, scenes like this filmed in the Philippines were not policed or monitored.
  -  Wikipedia Because of this scene, the film was not given the familiar ""No animals were harmed in the making of this film"" credit. The sacrifice of a carabao, which takes place during the Kurtz episode,
  was ""a real ritual slaughter performed by the Ifugaos."" As a result, Apoca-
  lypse Now is one of the few mainstream Hollywood films not to carry a
  statement in the closing credits that no animal was harmed during the
  making of the picture.
  -  Godfather: The Intimate Francis Ford Coppola, by Gene D. Phillips The American Humane Association has added Apocalypse Now to its list of ""Unacceptable"" films.   Featured Animal Action
Apocalypse Now was filmed in the Philippines in 1979. According to AHA's research, a water buffalo was hacked to pieces during the making of the film, earning the film an Unacceptable rating from AHA.

Is McConaughey's anecdote about not memorizing a four-page monologue real?,"The film is Scorpion Spring from 1995. According to this article from December 2016: McConaughey followed up with a doozy of a story from his 1995 film
  Scorpion Spring. ""I had this idea that I need to go back like I did in my first film,
  where I just knew my man, and I would show up and just play the
  circumstances - improvise,” he explained. “So I said, “I’m not going to read the script. Just tell me the
  character, tell me the situation, and I’ll show up, and I’ll just
  react and do what I would do.  “So I show up on set, we’re about to do the scene, and I said, “You
  know what? Since I know my man, let me just have a peek at these sides
  real quick.” I pick it up: four-page monologue … in Spanish.” It seems that Matthew McConaughey did not have an issue mentioning the film and the story in other interviews.  Here is an excerpt from a 2013 interview with the Hollywood Reporter where he names the movie: I go do this film, Scorpion Spring, and I got this idea: ""I'm not
  gonna look at anything. I know what I am: the drug lord on the Mexican
  border in Texas. I'll just show up on the set, stay fresh and loose.""
  Well, I get down there, OK, and I pick up this scene, and it's a
  page-and-a-half monologue in Spanish."
Is there an alternative cut of The Truman Show?,"I'll admit I'd never seen it in cinema, so I was unaware of some of these bits. The only reason I could see to cut those bits would possibly to alter the censor ratings, it's a well known fact that sometimes films (and tv series) when rated get given one thing for cinema/broadcast but when they are put onto a media format sometimes the show/films wants to try and get a lower bar of entry. A good example is with 'Bruno', there was a part with a swinging 'gentlemans part' and in most countries (e.g. Uk/Australia) where this gave the film an automatic 18 rating.  To combat this the film had 3 seconds removed so that the rating was then changed to 12 or 15. As another example, Red Dwarf famously had an episode that spoke about virginity and was given (at the time) a higher classification (15 I think it was), when it came to releasing the original VHS of the show, the standards had changed so that the episode would instead have been a 12, but the rules were that a show could not be reclassified unless there had been some changes to it.  In light of this, there was a 10 second clip added after the credits of starbug being stuck on the ice planet.  This was enough for the show to be reclassified and given the newer lower rating."

What was the significance of the deep fried kebab poster in Infinity War?,"This may be a reference to an obscure ""trend"" from Scotland. The Glasgow Stonner Kebab ""The Stonner"", a 1,000-calorie, deep fried pork sausage kebab has been dubbed the most dangerous fast food in Britain. The connection is that Vision and Scarlet Witch are hiding in Edinburgh, Scotland and they got to make a reference to a local 10+ year old fast food trend. Reading the article, these are indeed deep fried and not very good for you.  Probably only Hulk or Cull Obsidian should eat one while everybody else sticks to Chicken Schwarma"
Is Agrabah in India?,"If we look at the source material Aladdin is set in China, and implies that Aladdin is Chinese, however, certain aspects of the story contradict this: It is likely therefore that the storyteller is trying to set the story somewhere exotic without knowing the first thing about China. The source material therefore doesn't reference India, does reference China, but feels Arabic/Islamic. But, Disney may have decided to ignore the source material totally. So let's focus on what we see in... The film seems to be set in somewhere in Arabia not India. The opening song Arabian Nights places the song in Arabia Arabian nights, like Arabian days

Between the River Jordan and India there are countless rivers, including the Tigris and the Euphrates. Also if it was set in India, surely the river Ganges would have made more sense as a reference? This seems a deliberate attempt to make the audience think of somewhere close to the River Jordan and therefore Arabia. When Gazeem goes to the Cave of Wonder he exclaims: JAFAR: At last, after all my years of searching, the cave of wonders! IAGO: Awk! Cave of wonders! GAZEEM: By Allah! Having a character exclaim ""By Allah!"" seems an obvious ploy by the makers to place an Islamic content into the film, and although the Mughal Empire was Islamic, most people will think of Arabia in the context of Islam, especially when there are so many other attempts to show Arabian themes. When Aladdin finds the lamp in the cave with all the treasure there is a prominent Persian Winged Lion. Compare this with the Winged Lion housed in the British Museum from the Palace of Ashurnasirpal II in Assyria (Northern Iraq): 
 Again this seems like deliberate step by the creators to have the audience associate the film with Persia. During an exchange with Genie, Genie pulls a list from Aladdin's ear, the script states this is in Arabic, not Persian, Persian is written in Arabic, but just as you are likely to say written in English or French rather than written in Roman, here you would expect them to reference the language being used, not the script it is written in. (emphasis mine). So don't you sit there slack jawed, buggy eyed

GENIE pulls a list {written in Arabic} out of ALADDIN's ear, which he uses to rub his behind like drying off after a shower.) From a purely visual point of view this seems as though the creators are again enforcing the image that this is all taking place in an Arabic setting. Whilst on the topic of the script, for interest there are: Jasmine's father is the Sultan - The Mughal Empire destroyed/subsumed most of the Sultanates, it would be unlikely that there would be a Sultan within a Mughal setting. He would more likely to be called a Nawab. The Sultan wears a large white turban, with a feather in the middle.  Mughal Turbans The turbans worn by the Mughal Emperors were much shorter and often more ornate, with multiple colours and beads woven in. Emperor Aurangzeb and Emperor Shah Jahan 
 Seljuk Turkish Turbans The Seljuk Turks of the Ottoman Empire tended to wear higher white turbans. Suleiman the Magnificent, Sultan Kaihusrev II,Bayzid I    Illustrations from early 20th century editions of Arabian nights also depict the sultan as having a large white turban. Tales From the Arabian Nights - Enid Blyton - 1930 and Scheherazade Telling the Tales - Kay Nielsen - 1922 
 These depict the sultan, someone undeniably assumed to be Arabic, being told the 1001 Tales of The Arabian Nights - not the sultan from Aladdin, yet they have very similar turbans. This ""look"" of Arabian sultans from The Arabian Nights is therefore well established before Disney's Aladdin. Aladdin and Apu both wear a fez. 
 As do hungry little boys (note the very Arabian headdress on the man), and this guy.   There are 5 people wearing the fez in this picture of the Market, with 1 more wearing a distinctly Arabian headdress. I am hard pressed to see anyone wearing distinctly Indian attire in this picture.  Originating in the Balkans the fez soon ended up in the Ottoman Empire. It became a symbol of the Ottoman Empire when Sultan Mahmoud II ordered his civil servants to wear the fez in 1829 and banned the wearing of turbans. It soon became a symbol of modernisation with other nations following, Iran followed suit in 1873. It is not associated with Mughal India. There is one man, the Fire-eater, that wears distinctly Indian attire, appearing to be dressed as a Swami.  He stands out though as he is the only one dressed in this manner. Surely, in an Indian city, the Indian dress should be the norm not the exception, and the Arabian fashion would not be so prominent? This would suggest that he is not a native of the city and is perhaps a traveller. Alternately he could be a representation of a Fakir, a Muslim Sufi, who are also known for eating fire, laying on beds of nails and various other ""tricks"". As Fakir literally means poverty from the Arabic faqr one could expect a Fakir to be dressed in little more than rags. Jasmine and various other female characters are shown wearing Bedlahs.   These are, generally accepted to be, a Western imagining, particularly from the Victorian Era, of what Arab women wore. Belly dancers then appropriated it, as many people expected Middle Eastern dancers to wear. There is even a Warning! TV Trope about Bedlah Babes. This style of dress is also seen in the 1942 film Arabian Nights where Maria Montez playing Sherazade wears clothing that reveals her midriff. As well as the 1990 film Les 1001 Nuits where Catherine Zeta Jones plays Sherazade in revealing clothing (it might be worth noting this film had a lot of flesh on show).   This is further evidence that the creators were adding stereotypical, if not wholly accurate, Arabian themes in an attempt to fortify the impression that Aladdin is taking place in Arabia. The swords in Aladdin, though highly stylised, are clearly shown to be extremely curved. This is true for those swords owned by merchants, and the Sultans own guards.   These swords look very much like the stereotypical Arabian Scimitars, from innumerable sand and sandal epics.   Indiana Jones even fights an Arabic man wielding one in Cairo.  These in turn appear to be based on the Turkic Kilij and Shamshir, used by the Turkic Seljuk Empire and the Egyptian Mamluks.   Both are fairly curved blades with the Kilij possessing a yelman a sharp back edge, which gives the distinctive flare at the top. The Mughal Empire on the other hand used the Talwar (also know as Tulwar), a sword without as extreme a curve as the Kilij and Shamshir, it was also very unusual for a Talwar to posses a yelman.    For this to be set in India: It would mean all the Sultan's guards would be equipped with swords not used within the Mughal Empire, but ones that are used by Arab merchants (note the fez on the merchant's head). Or Both the guards and the Merchant own very rare Talwars possessing yelmans. Both of these scenarios seem unlikely, Occam's razor would indicate that  this is set in Arabia with everyone owning swords more likely to be found in that area. The names of the main characters are Arabic or Persian in origin. In Music Behind the Magic - Arabian Nights, Reprise #1 it is mentioned that the Sultan's name is Hamed an Arabic, Persian name meaning praiser With the architecture, yes domes of Agrabah could be seen as similar, though highly stylised, to that of Mughal architecture in India Such as the Taj Mahal (built 1632-1653). 
 However, Persian architecture also incorporates domes. For example Gur-e-Amir, In Uzbekistan, the mausoleum of Timur/Tamerlane (died 1405) - Built in the Azir style of Persian architecture.  Or the Shah Mosque in Iran (built 1611-1629) and the Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque in Iran (built 1603-1619) - both built in the Ishfahani style of Persian architecture. 
 Artistic depictions of Arabic buildings and palaces from the late 19th & early 20th were very heavy on the domes, as can be seen from these covers of Arabian Nights: Andrew Lang - Illustrated by HJ Ford - 1898 and Illustrated by Charles Folkard - 1917 
 Even in film depictions of stories from the Arabian Nights, such as A Thousand and One Nights, Arabian Nights, Les 1001 Nuits, The Thief of Bagdad (1924) and The Thief of Bagdad (1940), the latter being a heavy influence on Disney's Aladdin, all depict similar architecture 





 None of these are supposed to be set in India, with the the last two specifically being set in Baghdad. These films were also not immune to cultural misappropriation with the Thief of Bagdad (1940) having a very Indian statue in the form of Vishnu.  Arabian buildings having domes was therefore already in the public consciousness far before Disney's Aladdin, and can easily be explained as part of the inspiration for the look of the palace and other buildings of Agraba. the elephant sculpture at Sultan's throne has a distinct Indian style  Despite all the Arabian themes present throughout the film, there is this one sculpture that appears out of place, and could, suggest an Indian setting, the elephant sculpture in the Sultan's throne room. Elephants were not unique to India, and neither were sculptures or depictions of them in other art. Successive Persian Empires from the Achaemenid through to the Seleucid, Parthian, Sasanian and Abbasid used war elephants and they were esteemed for their strength and power (as they were by the Mughal Empire). The Abbasid even sent a war elephant Abul-Abbas to the Carolingian Emperor Charlemagne as a gift. Selucid War Elephant Sculpture, Sasanian War Elephants sculptures From Taq Bostan and a Sasanian elephant statue from 7th Century Iran 
   
Shatranj or Persian Chess had a piece (analogous with the bishop) called the Alfil or Elephant.
Here is an Abbasid Era Alfil from the 9th Century AD and an Abbasid Era Carpet depicting Elephants
 
There are also statuettes such as this Bronze oil Lamp from 11th Century Khorasan or this from 12th Century Iran
 
This shows that within the Persian and Arabic world, elephants were known and used within art, though stylistically they do not look like the one in the Sultan's throne room.
Until we get to the Safavid Dynasty
Here we have a young Rostam killing a white elephant in Shahnameh

The British Museum
And a 16th century Safavid copy of the History of Nigaristan (Iran)  depicting Bahram Gūr killing an elephant. 

The elephants are shown with headdresses and dressed tusks, more in line with the style depicted in the Sultan's throne room.
This 18th century Safavid Elephant Sculpture has numerous swirls and whorls, again more in line with the style depicted in the Sultan's throne room. 

While this doesn't prove that the elephant is not Indian in origin, I think it throws enough doubt, especially when considered with all the other pro arabian evidence, that the elephant in the throne room may not be conclusive proof that Aladdin is set in India.
Red Sandstone and Desert

Where in Baghdad is there the mountainous red sandstone and the sand dunes, which are the geography in the area of the palace? Iraq as a whole has very little to none of these.

Not in Baghdad, but in Jordan you have the Wadi Rum (a desert used to film many films set on Mars due to its colouring) a valley cut into the sandstone and granite rock in southern Jordan, to the east of Aqaba (not a huge leap of linguistic to get Agrabah from this)


Contrast this with the Thar Desert in India where the sandstone and sand is yellow.
 
The setting is that of a romanticised Arabian civilisation
All of the above, taken together would suggest to me that it is NOT set in India, but in Arabia, possibly in or very near to Jordan, therefore making it's setting Arabian, albeit one painted in a very stylised and romanticised manner, one that people expect Arabia of the Middle Ages to look like. This can be seen by very similar expectations shown in the illustrations of Arabia from the 19th and 20th century.
It's an amalgam civilisation that borrows from many facets of Arabian, Persian and Islamic (including Mughal) culture, architecture and fashion, from various different time periods, nothing points to it being set in India.
There is also no evidence that the creators took the decision to set this in India, in fact, throughout the film they seem to have attempted to show the setting in Arabia far more than it being set in India.
Even when talking about the creation of the film the animators suggest the theme they are attempting to portray is Arabian, such as here in Behind the scenes of Disney Aladdin - Meeting with the Animators



At 5:55 where Eric Goldberg talks about ""Hollywood Arabian"".
Or here:



Where right at the beginning they talk about incorporating the ""S-Curve"" to maintain that Arabic/Persian theme from the calligraphy and the Persian miniature paintings.
This is backed up by the book Disney's Aladdin The Making Of An Animated Film is how the work of Al Hirschfeld acted as a basis for most of the Characters (with the exception of Jafar) due to his work having similarities to the swooping lines of Persian miniatures and Arabic calligraphy.
And also from 3:50-4:00 where the animator refers to Aladdin specifically as Arabian.
Layout Supervisor Rasoul Azadani took over 1,800 pictures of his hometown Isfahan in Iran (home of the Shah Mosque above) as guidance for the scenery design. - Pop Up Fun Facts (DVD). Aladdin Platinum Edition Disc 1: Walt Disney Home Video. 2004.
That's a lot of pictures to take and then decide to set it in India.
Here are some picture of Isfahan.
    
From listening to the animators there can be no doubt that they were attempting to create a ""Hollywood Arabia in which Aladdin was set, and at no point do they believe they are creating an Indian setting. If the creators have not set this in India, then any Indian themes that are interpreted can only be put down to a mistake or cultural misappropriation through the hollywoodisation of the Arabic setting, for example, people, through years of seeing these in various media, expect to see these things in an arabic setting and these things are therefore provided.
Disney Distribution President of the time Dick Cook confirmed in this piece, talking about perceived racism within it from the American-Arab community, that both Aladdin and Jasmine are both Arabs:

Cook said ""Aladdin,"" which is loosely based on the stories of the ""Arabian Nights"" should be judged as ""an entire work where the hero Aladdin, and the Princess Jasmine also are Arab."" - Thanks to Johnny Bones

In Summary
It must be remembered that, at the end of the day, this is a Disney cartoon with a time travelling, shapeshifting genie, and is not supposed to be a historically accurate retelling of a story that itself is vague on it's setting. It does not even attempt to be a semi-""historical"" retelling of actual events, in the same way as Mulan or Pocahontas.
Any similarities with Mughal culture that may be interpreted can be put down to them using themes from across the Arab/Islamic world, which in the real world, share many similarities with each other, including Mughal India.
I think I have provided enough evidence that the creators had and used, plenty of inspiration from the Arabic world, in particular the ""Hollywood"" idea, dating back many decades, of what Arabia looks like, but very little, knowingly, from India, in setting the location.
I would argue that if Aladdin was supposed to be set in India then the Indian motifs would have been more obvious and not restricted to a statue of an elephant, some street performers that can be interpreted as Swami or Fakir and a palace that looks like the Taj Mahal, but also like many buildings from the Ishfahani style of Persian architecture. The many solely Arabian items, such as the fezs, swords, names and language used would have also been less prominent. And finally everyone that worked on the film would not have stressed so often that it was set in Arabia, with Arabian main characters.

From listening to the animators there can be no doubt that they were attempting to create a ""Hollywood Arabia in which Aladdin was set, and at no point do they believe they are creating an Indian setting. If the creators have not set this in India, then any Indian themes that are interpreted can only be put down to a mistake or cultural misappropriation through the hollywoodisation of the Arabic setting, for example, people, through years of seeing these in various media, expect to see these things in an arabic setting and these things are therefore provided.
Disney Distribution President of the time Dick Cook confirmed in this piece, talking about perceived racism within it from the American-Arab community, that both Aladdin and Jasmine are both Arabs:

In Summary
It must be remembered that, at the end of the day, this is a Disney cartoon with a time travelling, shapeshifting genie, and is not supposed to be a historically accurate retelling of a story that itself is vague on it's setting. It does not even attempt to be a semi-""historical"" retelling of actual events, in the same way as Mulan or Pocahontas.
Any similarities with Mughal culture that may be interpreted can be put down to them using themes from across the Arab/Islamic world, which in the real world, share many similarities with each other, including Mughal India.
I think I have provided enough evidence that the creators had and used, plenty of inspiration from the Arabic world, in particular the ""Hollywood"" idea, dating back many decades, of what Arabia looks like, but very little, knowingly, from India, in setting the location.
I would argue that if Aladdin was supposed to be set in India then the Indian motifs would have been more obvious and not restricted to a statue of an elephant, some street performers that can be interpreted as Swami or Fakir and a palace that looks like the Taj Mahal, but also like many buildings from the Ishfahani style of Persian architecture. The many solely Arabian items, such as the fezs, swords, names and language used would have also been less prominent. And finally everyone that worked on the film would not have stressed so often that it was set in Arabia, with Arabian main characters.
  And a 16th century Safavid copy of the History of Nigaristan (Iran)  depicting Bahram Gūr killing an elephant. 

The elephants are shown with headdresses and dressed tusks, more in line with the style depicted in the Sultan's throne room.
This 18th century Safavid Elephant Sculpture has numerous swirls and whorls, again more in line with the style depicted in the Sultan's throne room. 

While this doesn't prove that the elephant is not Indian in origin, I think it throws enough doubt, especially when considered with all the other pro arabian evidence, that the elephant in the throne room may not be conclusive proof that Aladdin is set in India.
Red Sandstone and Desert

Where in Baghdad is there the mountainous red sandstone and the sand dunes, which are the geography in the area of the palace? Iraq as a whole has very little to none of these.

Not in Baghdad, but in Jordan you have the Wadi Rum (a desert used to film many films set on Mars due to its colouring) a valley cut into the sandstone and granite rock in southern Jordan, to the east of Aqaba (not a huge leap of linguistic to get Agrabah from this)


Contrast this with the Thar Desert in India where the sandstone and sand is yellow.
 
The setting is that of a romanticised Arabian civilisation
All of the above, taken together would suggest to me that it is NOT set in India, but in Arabia, possibly in or very near to Jordan, therefore making it's setting Arabian, albeit one painted in a very stylised and romanticised manner, one that people expect Arabia of the Middle Ages to look like. This can be seen by very similar expectations shown in the illustrations of Arabia from the 19th and 20th century.
It's an amalgam civilisation that borrows from many facets of Arabian, Persian and Islamic (including Mughal) culture, architecture and fashion, from various different time periods, nothing points to it being set in India.
There is also no evidence that the creators took the decision to set this in India, in fact, throughout the film they seem to have attempted to show the setting in Arabia far more than it being set in India.
Even when talking about the creation of the film the animators suggest the theme they are attempting to portray is Arabian, such as here in Behind the scenes of Disney Aladdin - Meeting with the Animators

"Why did Daenerys say this in ""The Queen's Justice""?","You are taking it too literally. This is Dany's POV, not a legal POV. Nor is there a Supreme court of Westeros to issue a ruling on this matter. This is completely subjective to the person who is talking.  She said it because as far as she and Targaryen loyalists are concerned, she is in fact the only rightful claimant to the throne and real Queen of Westeros as scion of Aegon the Conqueror and only living child of the last Targaryen monarch, Aerys II Targaryen.  When she says that Jon is in open rebellion, she is correct in that as well. She has come to take back the seven Kingdoms and accept fealty of the Lords. If a Certain Lord refuses to give his fealty and proclaims himself independent King of one of the seven Kingdoms, he is in open rebellion against the throne which is rightfully Dany's as far as she is concerned.  Vows are perpetual but nobody holds to them anyways. When Robert Baratheon, Eddard Stark, Hoster Tully, Quellon Greyjoy, Tywin Lannister and Jon Arryn rose to oust King Aerys II, they were breaking their faith and their oaths. Stannis Baratheon remembers that choice too well, as he puts it, ""My Brother? Or My King? A Hard choice"". There was a possibility that Rebels would only kill Aerys and plant Prince Viserys or Aegon Rhaegarsen as new King but that possibility was crushed by Tywin Lannister who cleared the way for Robert to take the throne as Great Grandson of King Aegon V.  The Baratheon dynasty took the throne due to descent from Targaryens, the only ones who had a claim to the throne. All rebels accepted them as Kings because of that and because Robert had a badass warhammer.  As far as Targaryens were concerned, Baratheons were still usurpers and so are their heirs and successors. That's Daenerys' legal stance. She is going to take seven Kingdoms, which means all the seven Kingdoms. If she makes an exception for Jon, other Lords will demand the same. So she will demand fealty of Jon Snow. Monarchs have no friends, only subjects and enemies. If Jon isn't a subject, he is an enemy.  Daenerys is no foreigner though, do few years abroad make one a foreigner? If that's so, Oberyn Martell is also a foreigner given his exile in Essos. And why stop at that? All Targaryens are foreigners who came from Valyria. All Andals are foreigners who came from Andalos. All First men are foreigners who came from Essos. All Rhoynar are foreigners who came from Rhoyne delta. Only ones who are natives to Westeros are Children of the Forest and Giants.   And Daenerys holds Westerosi Titles. She is the Lady of Dragonstone, which is the same title which Rhaenyra Targaryen held two centuries ago when she fought against her brother King Aegon II for Iron Throne. The same title which Aegon the Conqueror held three centuries ago when he set out on forging the Iron throne. On the other hand, Jon never swore an oath to a Targaryen. All Stark Lords, including Eddard Stark were sworn to obey King Aerys II, his heirs and successors, but Jon has never taken that vow. That's just like First Greyjoy rebellion. When defeated Balon Greyjoy was brought to Robert Baratheon, Balon looked him in the eye and said ""You may call me a traitor and take my head, but no Greyjoy ever swore an oath to a Baratheon"". Robert laughed and said ""Then swear one to me now, or lose that head of yours"". Balon was correct that while he had sworn to obey Targaryens, he never swore an oath to Robert. Robert acknowledged that and let him renew his fealty to the throne. That's precisely what Daenerys is asking, bend the knee and renew the pledge."
Top-billed actor with the least screen time,"EDIT: We might have a new record. In the US historical epic One Night with the King from 2006, Peter O'Toole briefly appears in the prologue as the Prophet Samuel for ""barely 30 seconds"", according to Leonard Maltin's 2015 Movie Guide. (I timed it myself and it's about 25 seconds). Despite this, he's top-billed as the film's star:  Another notable example would be Ed Wood's Plan 9 From Outer Space from 1959. It's a B-movie, but by all means not experimental or avant-garde. It was famously filmed after Bela Lugosi's death and more or less based around some brief, silent footage of him which Wood shot before he died. Wood originally promoted it as ""Bela Lugosi's last movie"", and to make Bela's role more prominent, Wood then hired his wife's chiropractor as a stand in. So, although Lugosi's actual screen time is under 3 minutes (I counted it myself), he's still top-billed in the original promotional art:  [However, there is also the dubious practice of retroactively displaying a famous actor prominently in the promotional art of their older, more obscure films in which they only briefly appeared. TVTropes calls this Billing Displacement and features a few trillion examples, so you might find some more fitting titles there too.]"
"What's the difference between ""men of violence"" and ""violent men""?","In the continuation of this scene, Dr Jeremiah explains that difference: Dr Jeremiah: No assumption. Not at all. you misunderstand me,
  I said you are men of violence I'm not accusing you of being violent man
  It's quite different Please, please, edify us, Doc. You both served overseas Not much of a stretch, Doc. for all you know, we were both paper-pushers over there No, you were not. Since the schoolyard, I would bet neither 
  of you has ever walked away from a physical conflict. Not to suggest you enjoy it, but because retreat wasn't something you considered an option Men of violence are people who occasionally resort to violence when it is required - people like soldiers, police officers, bodyguards, or simply people willing to stand their ground. They all can resort to using force (i.e. in their line of work) but that violence is calculated as a necessity, not as an impulse. In contrast, violent men act on an impulse and resort to violence even when it is not called for and often do this for the pleasure it gives them. A man of violence will beat you up to restrain you, a violent man will beat you up because you looked at him funny."
"Why was there a ""point of no return"" in the Chernobyl series that ended in the meltdown?","Through incompetence and ignoring operating guidelines they had maneuvered the reactor into a very unstable state, where small changes would result in large swings in power.  They had: They had put the reactor in a very low power state, but had removed all controls on positive reactivity.  The xenon poisoning is slowly burned off over time, particularly as power slowly increases. [Please note from this point there are various scenarios hypothesized in reports and articles about the accident.  It's not entirely known why the operators used the AZ-5 switch.  This answer is based on the scenario dramatized in the TV show that a runaway power excursion forced them into using it as intended as an 'emergency stop' on the reactor. ] So, as shown in the dramatization, they suddenly find themselves in a situation where the power is starting to rapidly increase.  The xenon is all but removed, there are almost no control rods, and to make matters worse, boiling of the cooling water makes the reactor even more powerful. They see the power double every few seconds, quickly exceeding the maximum operating power of the reactor.  They are facing a meltdown of the core.  What do they do? OR To me this does feel like they had already gone beyond the point of return when the power spiked.  They were already going to experience a meltdown.  The AZ-5 system just made it worse, because the graphite tips of the control rods just created localized spots of even higher reactivity, leading to the steam them hydrogen explosion. Even manually lowering individual rods has the graphite tip problem.  The spike in power around the tip as it lowered caused the rods to jam in position.  The crew would not have appreciated this, but that route would have probably failed for the same reason as the AZ-5 system did.  However in any case, they would have been trained to press the AZ-5 switch in these situations because it is the ""emergency stop"" of a reactor."
Avengers Infinity War: Casualty List?,"Loki: Loki offers fake fealty to Thanos and then immediately tries to assassinate the evil alien. Thanos doesn’t buy Loki’s trick and
quickly murders him. Thanos quips, “No resurrections this time” after
killing him. Heimdall: Thanos and his children murder Thor’s best friend Heimdall (Idris Elba) when they invade Thor’s ship. But before he
dies, the Asgardian opens up a gateway to Earth for the Hulk to
escape. Gamora: Red Skull tells Thanos that he will have to sacrifice something he loves in order to get the Soul Stone. Thanos apparently
loves Gamora — just enough to throw her over a cliff. Gamora dies and
Thanos walks away with another Infinity Stone. Vision: Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) destroys the Infinity Stone inside Vision’s (Paul Bettany) head to keep it from Thanos. But
Thanos uses the Time Stone to turn back time and restore the stone and
Vision. He then crushes Vision’s head in his hands and takes the
Infinity Stone. Vision is left lifeless on the ground. Note: Shuri might be able to fix him as she was working on
something. Black Panther/T’Challa: Okoye (Danai Gurira) cries out as her king disintegrates. Spider-Man/Peter Parker: Spider-Man disintegrated on Titan. Doctor Strange/Stephen Strange: Doctor Strange disintegrates also on Titan. As he dies, he tells Iron Man that giving up the Time Stone
to Thanos in exchange for Iron Man’s life was the “only way.” Winter Soldier/Bucky Barnes and Falcon/Sam Wilson: Both got disintegrated in Wakanda. Scarlet Witch/Wanda Maximoff: Like many others, she also got disintegrated in Wakanda. The Guardians of the Galaxy Members: Star-Lord, Groot, Drax and Mantis — all four perish in the culling. However, director
James Gunn has already confirmed that Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3
will happen. So some combination of these characters certainly be
resurrected. Nick Fury and Maria Hill: The former S.H.I.E.L.D. agents disintegrate in New York in a post-credit scene from the film — but
not before they call on Captain Marvel for help. Captain America/Steve Rogers: When he faces down Thanos one-on-one, Thanos inexplicably decides to toss Cap aside instead of
just killing him. Iron Man/Tony Stark: Despite being stabbed in the stomach, Iron Man survives. Doctor Strange trades the Time Stone to save Iron Man’s
life. Thor: With the help of his new battle axe, Thor is able to stab Thanos in the heart. Thor survives, but he doesn’t stop Thanos from
destroying half the universe. Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff: Black Widow takes out several of Thanos’ children in the battle in Wakanda and survives the fight. Hulk/Bruce Banner: Bruce Banner also manages to live despite his inability to turn into the Hulk for most of the movie. War Machine/James Rhodes: Rhodey lost the use of his legs at the end of Captain America: Civil War (though he can now walk with the aid
of Stark technology). At least he made it through the end of Infinity
War. Rocket and Nebula: Of the original Guardians crew, only Rocket survives. Gamora’s sister Nebula also lives. Okoye and M’Baku: Black Panther may be dead, but Wakanda lives on. Okoye and M’Baku survive. Shuri: Black Panther’s sister Shuri tries to remove the Infinity Stone from Vision’s head, but is thrown from her lab by one of Thanos’
children before she can finish. We don’t see what happens to her when
half the world’s population disappears. Pepper Potts: The last we heard from Pepper, she was berating Tony for abandoning her to fight evil — again. We don’t know whether she
survived the culling. Captain Marvel/Carol Danvers: Nick Fury called Captain Marvel right before he disintegrated. The new, extremely powerful hero
probably survived the culling and will likely swoop in to help save
the day in Avengers 4. Hawkeye/Clint Barton: The archer (Jeremy Renner) was conspicuously missing from Avengers: Infinity War. He was on some house arrest. Ant-Man/Scott Lang: We know from the Ant-Man and the Wasp that Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) was put under house arrest after the events
of Captain America: Civil War and before Infinity War. Scott Lang (Ant-Man) survives the event, but appears trapped in the quantum realm. The Collector: We see the Collector (Benicio del Toro) alive and well in Thanos’ alternate reality, but then discover he’s not actually
hanging out in his museum. Did Thanos kill him? Did he flee? Did he
survive the culling? We don’t know. Wong: Wong (Benedict Wong) returns to the Sanctum Sanctorum to protect the building after Doctor Strange is taken captive by Thanos’
children. We never see whether he lives or dies. Valkyrie: She also survived somehow with a few other Asgardian/Thor 3 survivors (and maybe Korg and Meek too). Refer to this question for more details: Where was Valkyrie? We don't know the status of Eitri and Red Skull/Stonekeeper. Red Skull should be free now as he doesn't have to be a stone keeper, but we don't know if he got disintegrated or not. Most probably Eitri survived as the Gauntlet is burned up and they might need him in the sequel to make a new one, as per speculations/assumptions. Black Order Members (Corvus Glaive (stabbed for now but he can come back if he is depicted same as comics counterpart), Proxima Midnight (crushed by a giant machine), Ebony Maw (died in outer space when forced out of the ship through a hole), and Cull Obsidian (exploded in air by Hulkbuster (Bruce))."
What mitigation is taken while filming 'raining' scenes,"Rain jackets for cameras are available in market. If the rain is artificially created, we just have to focus on the frame we are shooting. We don't need water all over the place, but just within the frame. And if there is a lighting setup that's placed within that boundary, we have to some how keep the HMIs, sound gears, etc dry. Well, we could use umbrellas or rain coats for that. Also, we must focus on the safety of people. We can use GFCIs for protection from electric shocks as we need to power some device in the rain. A ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) or Residual Current Device (RCD) is a device that shuts off an electric power circuit when it detects that current is flowing along an unintended path, such as through water or a person.

Is it really possible to produce 99.9% crystal meth?,"Yes, it's possible. In theory, it's possible to produce a 100% pure sample of any substance; if you isolated and removed any molecules that were not those of your target chemical. The trick is that it's usually very impractical to do so, for various reasons. The cost of purifying chemicals rises sharply as the purity goes up, because you need more expensive and sensitive equipment, or more complex reactants, etc. If you want the details, you'd need to go to a chemistry textbook (or perhaps try the Chemistry Stack, though I doubt they're going to explain the process of making methamphetamine to you :) Having said that, it's completely possible for someone to produce near-100% pure crystal meth, because it's happened: That crystal meth was later seized by law enforcement, tested and found to be more than 99 percent pure — purer than the infamously high-quality meth cooked by Walter White, the fictional teacher-turned-drug-lord in the popular TV series ""Breaking Bad"" src"
Why did Qyburn use children for homicide?,"One word: Training. An old man trapped in a room won't likely be the last Westerosian that Qyburn wants dead. It's now clear that his approach to scaling his organization is by using destitute children.  Which makes sense, (once you get past any moral revulsion you might have): they're  malleable, desperate for someone who cares about them, and aren't considered a threat by others. Qyburn's developing a team, and we know that the teams' goals include: So, if you want to turn kids into assassins that can take out real threats someday, you'd likely need to do two things: Both of those are achieved by making them start with victims that pose no threat in controlled, supervised environments.  (If he's read the hot management tomes of the era, I assume he's already had them watch a mass stabbing prior to this scene's events, and will encourage them to teach a mass stabbing to the next class of urchins to really lock it in.)"
How can Iron Man's suit withstand this?,
How do they film scenes with the actors driving in a car?,"Another common technique is to use a ""process trailer"", aka an insert trailer or low loader.  It is used as a moving camera platform and is towed by a special truck-like vehicle that may contain cameras, booms and or lights. The process trailers are generally very low to the ground to give a realistic perspective of height.  They can expand in width to allow a camera to be placed along the side, for example to film actors speaking through a side window.  Note the safety bars in the first picture below so the crew don't fall off the trailer while it is moving. Some companies renting this type of equipment are Action Camera Cars and Shotmaker.  If they only need to shoot from the front, and not from the side, they can dispense with the trailer altogether and simply tow the car behind the film truck:  In either the case, the actor playing the driver doesn't actually drive the car, but they  must appear to be driving, same as if chroma key was being used with a stationary car on a set."
Why did the Joker lick his lips?,"From an interview with Christopher Nolan: I don't really know where that came from... He actually had a sort of prosthetic appliance for the scars that wrapped over his lower lips, and the first couple of scenes where he was playing it that way, I actually had thought it was a mistake... I thought the prosthetic was coming loose on the bottom lip and he was sticking it down with his tongue or something. And it was only after we shot a couple of scenes I realized oh no this is a thing he's found, this is a sort of... I think it's a lizard like... or serpent like elemental kind of gesture.. and I think it works... I think it's very creepy... [Click here to listen to Nolan talk about Ledger's creepy lip-smacking]"
Why does Bill Cage wake up in the helicopter?,"It's because the time loop works for roughly 24 hours.  As Rita said, the Omega would 'reset the day', which meant roughly 1 day prior would be as far back as the Alpha/Cage would go.  Cage's day before the invasion goes roughly like this: The next day, the invasion occurs.  During that day, they wake up, get in gear, and ship out; hours would have passed during all that.  Then Cage manages to kill the Alpha, and get its blood mixed with his own.  This must have happened 24 hours after step 2 above, during the hours that Cage was out.  Alternatively, it happened to occur exactly 24 hours after step 3, but the hours of him unconscious provides a nice window where if time is reset he wouldn't be able to alter his fate of being sent on the invasion. Now, why did he go back to earlier when the Omega was destroyed?  I offer these two assumptions: We don't know that 1 is true, as no one in-universe knows this.  2, is able to be true while still enabling what we see in the film.  The attack on the Louvre occurs earlier in the day than the invasion.  During the attack on the Louvre, it's still dark out.  J squad had been recruited for this mission during Step 4 above, the day of training.  They then get convinced to go, and head out.  They arrive during the evening/early-morning. The mission is a success, and the Omega is defeated.  This would have happened 24 hours after a point in time prior to Step 1 above, while he was asleep on the helicopter.  It would have triggered the start of a new time loop from that point it time. Ergo, Cage was sent back 24 hours prior to when the Omega was killed, which means he wakes up in the helicopter."
Why did Tyrion look displeased?,"Tyrion has sacrificed a lot, including loyalty to his family, to be Daenerys' advisor and hand. He believes in her and loves her as a queen and agrees with her vision of the new world she wants to build. He, along with Varys, has tasked himself primarily with keeping her potential madness in check (indeed, this is something Daenerys explicitly tasked Varys with) - this is highlighted in many episodes but is made explicit in a scene with Cersei in ""The Dragon and the Wolf"" (Game of Thrones, S07E07): CERSEI: Eventually, you want everyone to bend the knee to her. TYRION: Yes. CERSEI: Why? TYRION: (PAUSE) Because I think she will make the world a better place. CERSEI: You said she'd destroy King's Landing TYRION: She knows herself. She chose an advisor who would check her worst impulses instead of feeding them
—""The Dragon and the Wolf"" (Game of Thrones, S07E07) Tyrion strongly believes in Daenerys' ""better place"", but also has expressed deep concern (sometimes even hints of regret) about the things she does (when he watched Drogon burn the Lannister troops, or when he walked through the field of ash, or when he tried to stop Daenerys from burning the Tarlys). He already recognised this problem with the Jon-Daenerys romance at Dragonstone, in ""Beyond the Wall"" (Game of Thrones, S07E06), when he saw Daenerys risk everything (her own and her dragons' life, along with any hope for a new world) at the first mention of Jon Snow being in danger. Seeing Jon Snow entering her quarters (and correctly inferring that their romantic/sexual tension had come to fruition) struck him with deep concern because now he knows his own influence to keep Daenerys' worst impulses in check has been compromised, and moreover Jon will be able to influence her, or have her risk her life again whenever he is next in danger. Out-of-universe it is supposed to echo the concern going through the audience's mind, as we (watching this scene narrated by Bran) are experiencing the dramatic irony of this sex scene, and are having our own reservations about an incestual sex scene between an aunt and nephew, and are having our own thoughts and concerns about the political and romantic strife this will cause later on, when they find out. Tyrion's expression of concern serves narratively, but also out-of-universe to echo our own concern. In Game of Thrones: Cast Commentary on A Union of Fire and Ice (HBO), Peter Dinklage, the actor who plays Tyrion, comments on this very scene and gives some insight into why he reacts the way he does: It's dangerous for everybody involved. I'm sure it's good for both of them in the moment, but ... You don't even get the relief of how beautiful it could be or should be, it's ...""No! It's not good!"". But it should be, ""but it's not!"". It's Game of Thrones - there's a long history of romance not ending well on this show.

Explanation of the ending of A Clockwork Orange,"One thing you have to understand is that the book this movie was based on had a missing last chapter in American books. In the American books, the last chapter mirrored the last part of the film. In the UK version, the last chapter shows that Alex was 'cured' as much as possible, in that he ultimately gave up on violence of his own free will. See the Wikipedia article here. In the movie, as it stands, the 'cure' is that Alex was able to think for himself again, society be damned. The implication of the ending of the movie is that the politicians were willing to let Alex be his old self again, as long as it made them (temporarily) look good (not to mention that they used Alex's conditioning and subsequent rehabilitation to settle a score against the writer who drove Alex insane). So yes, he was being sarcastic, in that he was cured, all right - he was back to the same guy he was before."
Is the bird killing in The Prestige based on historical reality?,"It is based on a real trick, but the sources I provided do not conclusively state if any birds in these acts were ever killed. Only rumors and at least one inquiry, resulting in no substantial proof.   It appears the general nature of the trick in The Prestige is a variation of the real life, Vanishing Bird Cage: The vanishing bird cage, also known as the flying birdcage, is a
  classic parlour magic effect that was invented by French magician
  Buatier De Kolta. The trick has also been used by magicians Carl
  Hertz, Harry Beardmore, Harry Blackstone (Sr. and Jr.) John
  Mulholland, John Angel, Sabrina Vera, and Tommy Wonder. The magician displays a bird cage, holding it between both of his
  hands. The cage is rectangular, about six inches tall by six inches
  wide by eight inches long, and made of wire on all six sides. Often
  there is a bird, though in modern performances of the act it is
  usually fake, inside the cage. The magician will offer the cage for
  inspection by an audience member, but he will never actually release
  his grip of it. Then, without covering the cage, the magician makes a
  sudden motion and the cage (and anything inside) vanishes from sight.
  A variation of the trick was featured in the 2006 film The Prestige. More Information: The Vanishing Birdcage was a sensation and was also quickly ripped
  off. In the Summer of 1875 Harry Kellar is said to have purchased a
  cage from DeKolta's cousin for $750. Of course this was unauthorized
  because Buatier never sold cages to anyone.  This cage was probably
  the very first one outside of DeKolta's act, but it wouldn't be the
  last. In fact, Harry Kellar can probably be credited for the deluge of
  Vanishing Birdcages in America because he sold the secret to a magic
  dealer in exchange for props. In Europe a letter from Robert Heller to
  Charles DeVere the french magic dealer shows that the cages were
  already for sale in December 1875.  Harry Kellar stirred up a bit of controversy while in Australia over
  his presentation of ""The Flying Cage"" as he called it. Harry Kellar's
  routine was simple and direct, he counted to three and the cage with a
  live canary inside would vanish! A rumor circulated that Kellar was
  killing a canary every time he presented the effect. An inquiry took
  place and Kellar proved that was not the case. He showed that he had
  one bird and one bird only that he had been using for a long while.
  But this same controversy would come to haunt other magicians across
  the globe. In fact, this controversy was used as a minor plot point in
  the movie ""The Prestige"" in which they give a rather fictitious
  explanation on how the cage works."
Is it scientifically possible to grow potatoes in Martian soil?,"Normally, no, you could not grow plants in Martian soil... but adding nutrients to the soil makes it perfectly usable. There's a great article about it on Modern Farmer: And, yes, it is possible to grow plants on Mars—kind of. Alone, Martian soil doesn’t have the necessary elements for plant life. “The main thing that’s not in Martian soil is a bunch of nutrients and biological materials that plants rely on to grow,” Weir says. “It’s not there because, obviously, there’s no life on Mars.” So to get biological material into Martian soil, Watney uses the only spare biological material he has: astronaut poop. He mixes it in with the Martian soil, plants some potatoes that NASA had sent up with his crew, and, voila, you have plant life on Mars. There are a couple of slight issues... First, at the point in time Weir wrote the novel, he was unaware that there's large amounts of a salt in the soil, which would likely kill any plants or kill any humans eating them if it's not removed first: There’s just one problem that Weir didn’t address, because he didn’t know about when he wrote the novel: Martian soil has perchlorates, a type of salt that’s hazardous to the human body. The perchlorates would either make it more difficult for plants to grow, or would make the plants toxic. The solution is actually very simple, but it wasn’t included in the book or movie. “You can literally just rinse them out of the soil,” Weir says. “Wash the soil, soak it in water, and the water would wash the perchlorates away.” This is slightly problematic because water shortage was an issue for Watney, too.. but, it's surmountable. The other issue is that using human waste to add nutrients introduces pathogens that could similarly make anyone eating them ill. Weir addresses this as well, by making Watney only use poop that has his own pathogens. All of the poop from his fellows was left out in temperatures that would kill the pathogens off entirely. Eating food grown from someone else’s poop, in other words, can get you sick. In Watney’s’s case, he uses his own poop, so he would contract only the pathogens he already has. “You can get away with it in a desperate survival situation, where you are a single person using your own manure to grow crops that only you eat,” Weir says. But Watney also uses the crew’s leftover waste from the station’s toilet, which could mean that he could have contracted his crew members’ pathogens as well. (The movie isn’t as gross as it sounds, we promise.) This is addressed with a bit of explanation in the book, but isn’t said explicitly in the film. “The crew’s waste was all completely desiccated, freeze-dried, and then dumped out on the surface of Mars and bagged,” Weir says. “Any pathogens in there would have been dead.” As a note, most of the science in The Martian has been pretty solidly backed up because Weir did a lot of work studying the science and learning what he needed to so that he could write a very realistic story. ""The Martian"" is hitting cinemas right about now, and already it is being heralded as one of the most scientifically accurate sci-fi films of all time. We’ve seen the movie, and we’ve got to say, it’s amazing how far we’ve come since ""Armageddon"" (shudder). NASA has been so impressed, they've been using the movie as a marketing campaign for their own, actual manned missions to Mars in the 2030s. And, as a bonus, it seems that some at NASA actually believe the soil may be usable as is: In the movie, after becoming stranded on the surface, Watney resorts to using a combination of his own excrement, water, and Martian soil to grow potatoes. But would Martian soil actually be of any use? Isn’t it sterile and dead? “In terms of basic mineral content and chemical content, yes it would be possible to grow plants in Martian soil,” said Lavery. “We actually have experiments going on right now using simulated Mars soil, and it indicates that’s a very realistic idea.”"

Did John Doe manage to complete his 'masterpiece' in Se7en?,"John Doe planned this meticulously for a very long time, and with the exception of that small glitch where Somerset and Mills find his apartment a bit too early, it's safe to say his plan is carried out. However, Doe's plan involves 7 victims representing each sin, but not necessarily performing them or dying for them: As you can see, the master plan was never as straight forward as '7 people dying for their sins' but rather a complex admonition involving 7 victims and the 7 deadly sins, that eventually loops in on itself (with Doe and Mills playing a part in it: Doe being envious because he's unable to live a normal life in the sick world he's in, and Mills representing the law's inability to cure it). Doe wanted his master plan to be ""puzzled over and studied"", and now, as Somerset realizes, he's certainly going to achieve that."
"What's with dark ""shining"" in old black and white TV?","This happened in many TV shows that were captured using a vacuum tube based analog electronic video camera. Scripted television was more often produced on traditional movie film, but lower budget productions, live broadcasts, news, sports, etc., were often made with electronic video cameras that recorded to magnetic tape - precursors of the color video cameras of the 70s - 90s. The dark “halo” around a bright spot in the image is caused by limitations in these early electronic video cameras. There’s no citation, but there is an explanation on Wikipedia: The mysterious dark ""orthicon halo"" around bright objects in an image orthicon-captured image is based on the fact that the IO [the camera system; full name “image orthicon”] relies on the emission of photoelectrons, but very bright illumination can produce more of them locally than the device can successfully deal with. At a very bright point on a captured image, a great preponderance of electrons is ejected from the photosensitive plate. So many may be ejected that the corresponding point on the collection mesh can no longer soak them up, and thus they fall back to nearby spots on the target instead, much as water splashes in a ring when a rock is thrown into it. Since the resultant splashed electrons do not contain sufficient energy to eject further electrons where they land, they will instead neutralize any positive charge that has been built-up in that region. Since darker images produce less positive charge on the target, the excess electrons deposited by the splash will be read as a dark region by the scanning electron beam.[citation needed] Here’s a less succinct but closer to first-hand source: http://www.electricalfun.com/ElectronCafe/Image_Orthicon_tube.aspx Excerpt from the second source: The dark halo effect is when the bias is not quite right in the IO tube or the light is too bright. Secondary electrons are knocked out of the glass target and rain down around the bright spot and contaminate the image charge on the glass. If the ""shader,"" a person who sat there tweaking the camera continuously in real time like automatic circuits still do to this day, was really good at their job, you would not see the halo effect. Some directors liked to have just the tiniest amount of shading in the image as it gives the perception of a sharper picture. It isn't really, but tell that to your brain! A highly technical expiation of the imaging tube that creates this effect is here: 

 Here’s an easier explanation of how the cameras worked:

Why Keep Forming Voltron?,"Voltron was once a single, sentient robotic Mecha. Depending on the original Japanese cartoon where an unnamed ""space goddess"", or the American adaptation where the evil witch Haggar, cast a spell that separated Voltron into five robotic parts. GoLion's story is set in 1999, when the planet Altea had already been subdued and enslaved by the Galra Empire. Five space pilots return to Earth to find the planet annihilated by thermonuclear war. Eventually, the explorers are captured and enslaved, and forced to fight for their lives in Emperor Daibazaal's arena. The young pilots escape and eventually land on the planet Altea, where they discover the secret of the mighty sentient robot GoLion, the only one powerful enough to defeat Emperor Daibazaal's forces. Thousands of years ago, GoLion was an arrogant robot who, after defeating several beastmen, tried to challenge the Goddess of the Universe to battle, but failed. To teach him humility, the goddess separated him into five pieces in the form of five lion robots that sailed through space and crash-landed on Altea, to lay in wait for those who would one day reawaken him to fight evil once again. Once split up, the five parts (lions or vehicles depending on version) are needed to be piloted to form Voltron. Once formed, Voltron has a time limit (5 Minutes in one episode, the lowest it was) before it gets split up. The limit is eventually ignored. The fight rages between Voltron and the robeast, but it is perilously approaching Voltron's 5-minute limitation. Voltron finally gains the upper hand and, forming his Blazing Sword to finish the job, destroys it with gusto. ""But remember he has only 5 minutes of stored nuclear power. He's our last line of defense.""
—Commodore Steele notes Voltron's limitation And Voltron can't stay formed without the five parts being actively piloted. If they aren't in the lions/vehicles, then Voltron splits up. Additionally, the Lions can heal or self-repair when separated, but not when joined together. They are also often used to scout different areas, as fully capable weaponized space ships. Keeping them together as Voltron the entire time would be a waste of resources."
Is there a third Holmes sibling?,"This is a key theme of the fourth series of Sherlock. Therefore, spoilers follow, principally from Series 4 Episode 3 'The Final Problem'.  Sherlock and Mycroft have a sister Eurus, a potentially 'era-defining' genius. Sadly she became a danger to the family and to others from a young age and was taken into care; later she was exiled to a facility known as Sherrinford by Mycroft. She is unknown to Sherlock as he had reacted to the trauma of the early events of his life by blocking Eurus and her actions out of his memory.  ... for these reasons Mycroft generally avoids making reference to a third sibling except occasional oblique comments such as the one you describe."
How did they film the walks between the Twin Towers in The Walk?,"TL;DR Detailed Answer: They acquired the original blueprints for the Trade Center and the production designer Naomi Shohan designed and built an enormous, 40-foot-by-60-foot corner of the South Tower to film most of the actions. Since the two towers were largely mirror images of each other; Shohan could simply strike the stage dressing on top of the roof and re-dress it for its opposite corner. From this page Relying on the original blueprints for the Trade Center, Shohan designed and built an enormous, 40-foot-by-60-foot corner of the South Tower, where most of the action takes place as the story stays with Philippe during the caper. Though the filmmakers would need to film action from the North Tower as well, they could make due with only one corner, because the two towers were largely mirror images of each other; Shohan could simply strike the stage dressing on top of the roof and re-dress it for its opposite corner. To recreate the rest of the roof, the towers, and 1974 New York as seen from nearly 1400 feet in the air, Kevin Baillie and his visual effects team built a model that is meant only to be viewed from above – Petit’s point of view during his walk. However, because Zemeckis planned a few shots from below – for example, from the World Trade Center Plaza – these areas of the model are complete and ready to be explored, as if you were walking around the city. In the end, recreating the structures of the city and the Towers took Baillie’s “construction team” of 15 people three months to complete – four man-years’ time – after which a team of more than 100 artists spent five months integrating that digital world into the green screen footage from set. “There were definitely times when it was emotional, for both myself and the crew,” he says. “As we went through the reference photography, we saw a lot of imagery from 9/11, because those are obviously the latest images that you can find of the towers. So I think we felt a great sense of responsibility for portraying the towers in a way that was honest and also honored them.  Image Source This Indiewire article goes into more details. “For the third-act walk, we built one corner of one of the Towers (40 feet long and 12 feet high),” Baillie explained. “That’s all they could fit on the stage in Montreal and still have room for about 100 feet of cable for the walk action to happen [with actor Joseph Gordon-Levit as Petit]. “The rest was green screen in all directions. We had to do digital extensions of the rooftop and the Towers and recreate those. And 1974 New York looks remarkably different from today, so we couldn’t just take photography of modern day New York. We had to recreate New York completely from scratch. What you see is 20% filmed real and the rest recreated. Rodeo did set extensions of the World Trade Center lobby.” Building New York from scratch (including buildings, hot dog stands, newsstands, cars and people) first began by getting reference footage for two days in a helicopter to monitor traffic flow and how people look from that height. “The unexpected outcome for me was getting permission to hover right over Ground Zero at 1,400 feet, which is the exact place where Philippe walked. I was able to evaluate every shot in post around that sensation,” Baillie added. The cityscape was achieved through a combination of Maya and Modo for model making and then they used Mari and Modo, depending on the artist, to texture the buildings. Atomic did all of the look development, shading, and lighting in Katana. Then it was all rendered in Atomic’s in-house cloud-rendering platform called Conductor, which is being released commercially at the end of the year. “We do all of our rendering in the cloud and it manages the entire cloud process from beginning to end so an artist doesn’t have to think about it,” Baillie said. “By doing that, we rendered about 9.1 million processor hours in the cloud for The Walk, the largest cloud-rendered feature film, which is more than 1,000 years on a single processor worth of compute.”  Gordon-Levitt was trained to perform the walk. During the photography, sometimes they filmed and sometimes the stunt double. From FX Guide “The wire was rested inside this Canadian Bar. It was a 20 foot long steel beam with a slot in the middle that we were able to fit the wire into. So we’d move it below the wire and raise it on these tripods so that it sat in the beam. Joe’s feet would still be on the wire, and he’d still be able to feel the wire, and his foot would curve around the wire, but then he would have the beam on either side of it to support him if he was getting off-balance. Occasionally in comp, we’d use NUKE’s warping tools to warp the wire very subtlety with his weight. We used the shots of either Joe really walking on the wire or his stunt double walking on the wire for how the cable moved and how it kind of breathed during the walk experience to make sure we were emulating that same look. And if his feet were touching the Canadian Bar and flattening out and not curving around the wire as much as they should have been, our compositors would go in and curve Joe’s feet a little more and even paint in a little rounding to make it look 100 per cent believable.” “The key to all that succeeding,” suggests Baillie, “was actually that there were so many different methods that we used. Sometimes Joe was walking without the Canadian Bar, sometimes it was the stunt performer, Jade Kindar-Martin, who’s a Cirque du Soleil trained performer, and then sometimes it was the Canadian Bar. If we’d used the same method again and again it would have become obvious that we were faking something, but because we were only faking it sometimes, you buy it more.” Gordon-Levitt was trained by Philippe Petit to perform this walk. From Collider (Thanks to Obsidian Phoenix) Collider: What was your level of either training or assisting Joseph Gordon-Levitt and his stunt performers? Philippe: Of the stunt people, there was one young man who is both a professional wire-walker and stunt man, so he was already at ease in providing all the action that was needed for the camera. I was the first one to say to Mr. Zemeckis, “I could train your actor and have him physically walk without anything else on a wire—not a very high wire or very long one —but it would help don’t you think?” And he said, “No. You cannot do that, it is impossible.” I told him that I think it is possible, and it would help show my work. I would love to have the actor, really walking, on a real wire. So we looked at the calendar and between all of our schedules, it was determined that I had 8 days. So in 8 days I trained Joseph Gordon-Levitt to walk on a tight rope."
What do they use for broken glass pieces in movies?,"It's not actually glass... Originally, they used a product called ""Sugar glass"" or ""candy glass"". Sugar glass (also called candy glass, edible glass, and breakaway glass) is a brittle transparent form of sugar used to simulate glass in movies, photographs and plays. It is much less likely to cause injuries than real glass, and it easily breaks convincingly, making it an excellent choice for stunts. Sugar glass is also used to make sugar sculptures. Because sugar glass is hygroscopic, it must be used soon after preparation, or it will soften and lose its brittle quality. It's incredibly easy to make, taking no special skill (Practice for clarity and equipment to make large pieces aside). However, the sugar absorbs moisture, it isn't very stable, so they have modern substitutes made from brittle plastics. They are still very easy to break but they don't suffer from deterioration over time the way that sugar does. Q: Is it made of sugar?
  A: Breakaway Glass is made of a mixture of plastics, not sugar. Also, because it's not sugar, it can be used for vessels and jars, so it can hold liquids, at room temperature. Note that there is still some risk. You're not as likely to be injured by breakaway glass as real glass but you can still get hurt, so stunts people are still very cautious around these products."
What did David say to the engineer in Prometheus?,"Edit: Now we know. In an interview revealed at Total Film with Dr. Anil Biltoo: Well, according to Dr. Anil Biltoo, the film’s official translator and linguistics consultant, David did as he was asked, translating his words as follows: “This man is here because he does not want to die. He believes you can give him more life.” The rest of the text of this article stands unedited except for the interview inserts, in italics. We are forced to reconcile the reaction of the Engineer with: Does David betray his creator? His pathological hatred of all of humanity is obvious to us, but not necessarily to them. Would he use the opportunity to ask a different question than he was asked or would he comply out of duty (or programming). My suspicion is David asked exactly what he was told by Weyland. Not that it mattered, the Engineer answered only with his actions to kill the team. My supposition still stands and is supported in the rest of the Total Film interview review: So there we have it. David wasn’t up to anything sinister, it just turned out that the Engineer wasn’t best pleased to be interrupted by a member of the species he was charged with destroying. Apparently, the scene was initially written to involve a much longer conversation, so perhaps more details will emerge in the deleted material on the DVD. Or even in a sequel… Why wouldn't David say what he had been asked to? He is not concerned with the question or the answer. For him, it is academic at best. He has already made his decision about humanity and given the information he has up to that point, he assumes the Engineers already have their own less than stellar opinion of humanity as well. However, given the purported intelligence of the Engineers, and a time-table of their last visit (approximately 2,000 years ago, during a very warlike period on Earth) once he saw how violent, humanity had remained, he realized he would have to complete his mission. He did not seem conflicted in any way. My suspicion was he recognized what David was and could extrapolate how long he had been asleep, which may have given him greater motivation to deliver his payload, fearing a galactic outbreak of this violent species. The Engineer did not seem surprised to see us, likely as a diminutive and less impressive form of itself. I had the impression the Engineer did not fear humanity, so much as their lack of individual control. He was privy to, in a matter of seconds, hierarchical dominance behavior, aggression, anger, and directed violence. From the aspect of a species that creates life, certainly an undesirable outcome. Perhaps the same reaction we might have if a beloved pet suddenly attacked us. We would put it down, for its own good. The Engineer maintained a surprising level of apparent emotional control during his attack on the team and his subsequent launching of his ship. He did not appear to have any issues with completing his mission, so his belief in the necessity was apparent in his actions. I would also have to credit this Engineer with some degree of forethought. He was the only one on this ship to make it back to stasis and secure himself before the pathogen was able to reach him. I suspect he thought it would be safer to be in stasis than dying in the halls. David's experience of humanity soured him on meeting the Engineers and even though he was intellectually curious about their technology, he showed no real interest in the Engineers, themselves, likely considering them as potentially dangerous as he considered mankind. Maybe more so, since humanity was based on their DNA. If he did give the Engineer an account of what happened or how they came to be here, rather than Wayland's requested information, I am certain, he was surprised with his/it's reaction. It was certainly not an expected outcome from David's perspective."

How were R2D2 and C3PO made in the original trilogy?,"For c-3po, it was a costume, Anthony Daniels played c-3po:  For R2-D2, It was a costume and a remote controlled robot. CGI was also used in the prequel trilogy. So, they had Kenny Baker to play him :
 And from Portrayal section of wookieepedia article on R2-D2 :  Baker performed the role of R2-D2 inside a standing unit of the droid, wearing a specially-made suit and manipulating the droid's lights and appendages, turning his head, rocking his body back and forth, and moving his eye with a rod. In addition to Baker's unit, every Star Wars film has made use of a number of remote control units, as Baker's was largely immobile.
  [...]
  A computer-generated R2-D2 was also used in many scenes of the prequel trilogy, including a scene in Episode II where the character walks up a staircase. Baker has stated that he would never have been able to do that in his costume."

Language of the Moria password in The Fellowship of the Ring,"That gate to Moria was created in the ""Second Age"" of Middle Earth, and was used to trade mithril with the Noldorian Elves of Eregion.  Relations between the Elves and the Dwarves were more cordial in the Second Age. The inscription and password on the gate created by Celebrimbor, the leader of the Noldor, hence is in elvish. Celebrimbor also forged the 3 Elvish rings of power. [This is all in the Silmarillion] In The Fellowship of the Ring, the inscription on the door reads: Im Narvi hain echant. Celebrimbor o Eregion teithant i thiw hin ""I, Narvi, made them. Celebrimbor of Eregion drew these signs"" (taken from Wikipedia, I hope it is accurate).  So Narvi the dwarf built the gate, and Celebrimbor drew the lettering and the cast the spell which only opens when the password is given."
What is the name of the movie in which eating and toilet taboos are reversed [closed],"Luis Buñuel's Le fantôme de la liberté (The Phantom of Liberty) (1974): One of Luis Bunuel's most free-form and purely Surrealist films,
  consisting of a series of only vaguely related episodes - most
  famously, the dinner party scene where people sit on lavatories round
  a dinner table on, occasionally retiring to a little room to eat. The scene you are looking for is available on Youtube."
What is the story with the fire in Doc Brown's house?,"Bleeding Cool addresses this: In the Blu Ray commentary for Back To the Future, producer Bob Gale says: The opening shot, when the camera is going through Doc’s laboratory, there’s a newspaper on the wall that says the Brown mansion was destroyed in a fire. You can infer from that that maybe Doc set his house on fire to collect the insurance money. However, the BTTF comic has a somewhat alternate explanation: In today’s Back To The Future #2 comic book from IDW Entertainment
  written by Bob  Gale, it seems not. Well, not entirely. I mean, he did burn down his mansion. But it was only to restore a
  timeline. Some have wondered why, after the information and experience
  with a working flux capacitor in the original movie, the 1950’s Doc
  Brown didn’t then go one to build a better, faster time machine,
  funded by the military. Well, it seems, he did. And it changed the future even more. So he had no option but to
  destroy the original."
Are Americans the bad guys in Russian movies?,"Not really.  Most Russian movies and TV shows are set in Russia and dealing with local themes, so bad guys (if any) are Russian. War films have German (i.e. Nazi), Afghan or Chechen villains, some 2000s movies feature Middle Eastern 'terrorists'. Rare American characters are stereotypically portrayed as rich, overconfident and stupid, but never evil.  There was a number of Cold War era Soviet movies and TV series about American spies, like 'TASS Is Authorized to Declare...', but this genre has gone with the Cold War."
Has a movie ever referred to a later movie? [closed],"Most Pixar films have appearances of characters from future movies. This list comes from the Pixar Fan Wiki: Monsters, Inc. - Clownfish, the main characters of Finding Nemo, are depicted three times:  Finding Nemo has allusions to the two films that followed it:  The Incredibles Ratatouille: Your Friend the Rat WALL•E Up  Toy Story 3: Finn McMissile is featured on a poster in Andy's room.  Also in Andy's room is a ""Newt Xing"" sign, an allusion to newt. Even though newt was canceled, it had been set to be released in 2012 (two years after Toy Story 3), and as such, this was technically a reference to an upcoming film.

What could have resulted in such a huge crater in WW I?,"That all depends on how big the artillery shell was.  A standard 75mm/18lb shell would have difficulty making a hole anywhere near that big, but the largest shell fired in WWI was 3,130 lbs! used by the 520mm French Schneider Howitzer...  Somewhat more portable were the 24cm or 25cm Schwerer Flügelminenwerfer* which carried a 200 lb charge…
*Roughly translates to 'heavy winged mine thrower' - the shells had fins at the rear.    Then there was Big Bertha - with a 17"" barrel - which could leave shell craters  as wide as 9 m (29 ft 6 in) and as deep as 6 m (19 ft 8 in).    It's quite difficult to picture the size of this - it was 15ft tall, 32ft long"
