Why are so many Americans against Obamacare?,"These are a few reasons why each group is against Obamacare. Some do not think that the government should force citizens to buy health insurance and penalize them if they do not do so. There are taxes that Americans have to pay should they not buy health insurance. This is also one of the main reasons Americans are against Obamacare. Some are just against the fact that the government is ordering everyone to purchase coverage. Americans who can afford to buy insurance directly from a provider are charged higher premiums so that they could assist in paying for the subsidies provided to those who buy their coverage from government-run marketplaces. Thus, some view Obamacare on a whole as a welfare scheme and the Medicaid expansion and subsidies for low- and moderate-income enrollees as an entitlement program that uses taxpayers' money to help people they consider undeserving. Furthermore, the premiums are set to rise by an average of 22% in 2017. Obamacare changed the rules of the types of public insurance that people can directly buy, thus some insurers canceled their old plans and charged higher premiums for the new plans to existing customers. Thus, this group of people doesn't really benefit from Obamacare, and thus they are upset about it. Some insurers lost money as the customers are sicker than they expected. Thus, the cost would have to be covered by better-off Americans. This will deter healthy, young Americans from signing up, increasing the prices of premiums. Some oppose it simply because it's a Democratic healthcare plan and it was passed when both the House and the Senate were under Democratic control. Only one Senate Republican, Olympia J. Snowe (R-ME) voted the bill out of the Finance Committee while another Republican in the House, Rep. Joseph Cao (R-LA 2nd District), voted for the initial version in 2009. No Republicans voted for the amendment in 2010. The majority of the Republicans have been consistent in their opposition towards Obamacare. Below is a graphic from Vox that shows the percentage of Americans who agrees with each statement listed: "
Why doesn’t the IRS just send me a bill for the taxes I owe based on the info they already have?,"It's certainly possible, and plans have previously been made to do it, but then what would happen to the tax preparation industry? That may seem like a silly question, but for the capitalist tax prep industry, automating away a large portion of their industry is a huge problem, so naturally they would lobby against it. ProPublica has an article from last year that covers the issue. Here’s how preparing your taxes could work: You sit down, review a prefilled filing from the government. If it’s accurate, you sign it. If it’s not, you fix it or ignore it altogether and prepare your return yourself. It’s your choice. You might not have to pay for an accountant, or fiddle for hours with complex software. It could all be over in minutes. It’s already like that in parts of Europe. And it would not be particularly difficult to give U.S. taxpayers the same option. After all, the government already gets earnings information from employers. But as ProPublica has detailed again and again, Intuit — the makers of TurboTax — and H&R Block have lobbied for years to derail any move toward such a system. And they continued in 2016. Intuit spent more than $2 million lobbying last year, much of it spent on legislation that would permanently bar the government from offering taxpayers prefilled returns. H&R Block spent $3 million, also directing some of their efforts towards the bill. Among the 60 co-sponsors of the bipartisan bill: then congressman and now Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price. The bill, called the Free File Act of 2016, looks on the surface to be consumer-friendly. It makes permanent a public-private partnership in which 13 private tax preparation companies — called the “Free File Alliance” — have offered free online tax filings to lower- and middle-income families. The Free File Alliance include both Intuit and H&R Block. But the legislation would also permanently bar the IRS from offering its own free alternative. Intuit has repeatedly warned investors about the prospect of government-prepared returns. “We anticipate that governmental encroachment at both the federal and state levels may present a continued competitive threat to our business for the foreseeable future,” Intuit said in its latest corporate filings. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., offered a bill last year that would have actually allowed the government to start offering prefill tax returns. While Intuit did not lobby against Warren’s bill — presumably because the legislation had little chance of success — tax giant H&R Block did. (H&R Block did not respond to a request for comment.) Neither Warren’s bill nor the Free File Act made it out of committee."
Why is communism considered as evil (like fascism and nazism) in the United States?,"The answers so far are not answering the question.  People are saying why they believe communism is morally wrong, not why Americans believe it is evil. The American Cultural Context The simple answer is that America has always been suspicious of foreign ideas, especially those which conflict with values considered quintessentially American (WASP).  Manifest Destiny is still an important influence on how Americans think about their country and the world. America is believed to be uniquely special, and foreign ideas can only dilute the country's purity. There have been two Red Scares in American history. 1917-20, and 1947-57.  As the Cold War went on fear of communism intensified, and was a primary motivation for involvement in the Vietnam War. As he [JFK] told senator and Vietnam skeptic Mike Mansfield after the Cuban
Missile Crisis, ""If I tried to pull out completely now from Vietnam,
we would have another Red scare on our hands."" In July 1963 he is said
to have told reporters at an off-the-record news conference: ""We don't
have a prayer of staying in Vietnam.... But I can't give up a piece of
territory like that to the Communists and get the American people to
reelect me."" Hostility to communism lingers because of the American character, which hasn't changed much over the last century.  America's core values remain religious, and for economic and personal freedom as they understand it. Americans today are far more religious and individualist than their peers in other developed nations.  Consider this analysis by Pew Research. Also consider this data from Gallup.  America's most religious states are as religious as Iran, India, Iraq, while America's least religious states are twice as religious as the least religious countries in the world, Estonia, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Czech Republic, Japan, France.   As a result of all this, Americans are usually hostile to atheists and collectivist ideas. Communism happens to be very atheist and very collectivist. Meanwhile, Elsewhere But this is a distinctly American psychology.  Many other cultures value collective responsibility, and regard self-expression with apathy.  Japan is perhaps one of the best contrasts, but it's also true to an extent in places like Germany and Scandinavia (consider the Danish Law of Jante).  In 2009 Der Spiegel published an article which found half of East Germans were sympathetic to the former communist dictatorship. Today, 20 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, 57 percent, or an
absolute majority, of eastern Germans defend the former East Germany.
""The GDR had more good sides than bad sides. There were some problems,
but life was good there,"" say 49 percent of those polled. Eight
percent of eastern Germans flatly oppose all criticism of their former
home and agree with the statement: ""The GDR had, for the most part,
good sides. Life there was happier and better than in reunified
Germany today."" In former Soviet states, most notably Belarus, the Communist past is regarded as something largely historical rather than evil.  Without the Red Army, the people of Belarus would have been annihilated by a roaming Nazi genocide. The headquarters of the Russian Social Democratic and Labour Party was founded in Minsk, and so Belarusians have a deep relationship with Communism and Soviet security forces.  I've visited Minsk, and there are museums dedicated to the Great Patriotic War and the Belarusian police force (exhibits explaining their involvement in the war, Chernobyl, and Afghanistan). This is quite the contrast to examples like Hungary's House of Terror, which makes the point that Nazism and Communism are equivalent evils.  In Belarus there are statues of Lenin everywhere, while in other former Communist states Lenin was removed swiftly after the collapse of the Soviet Union.  The difference depends upon whether the Soviets are regarded as liberators or invaders. The Ethical Imbalance Often rejection of communism is post-rationalised ethically.  Given the aforementioned, there are common references to a communist state ""stealing"" from the individual, but this is not a universal belief.  Many cultures appreciate communal interdependence; meaning the idea that a collective ""steals"" from the individual is absurd, as the individual's wealth creation is dependent on the collective working together. Examples of Anti-Communist terror are rarely acknowledged. Consider Suharto's purge of Indonesia in 1965 resulting in a million deaths, or the Dirty War in Argentina resulting in 30,000 ""disappeared"", or the Vietnam War resulting in two million civilian deaths. The other issue often brought up is the death toll produced by Communist states.  Obviously this is factual, but in the Cold War it was not one sided.  The truth is that both the USSR and USA were responsible for mass-murder, committed to enforce their regional influence.  The above image was taken in New York City.  The implication here isn't that Communists are worse because they killed more people.  It's that Communism is uniquely murderous, which isn't true.  This also doesn't explain anything.  An honest tally comparing the death toll of different ideologies would produce a very different message (perhaps a better one; that dogmatism leads to intolerance and murder). Furthermore, both Communist and anti-Communist forces engaged in state terror.  Consider the brutality inherent in Communist systems, and also the brutality inherent in the states America nurtured in Latin America through Operation Condor.  Argentina's dictator General Jorge Rafael Videla claimed to be fighting terrorism and said: A terrorist is not just someone with a gun or a bomb, but also
someone who spreads ideas that are contrary to Western and Christian
civilisation. This was typical amongst the juntas endorsed by the United States, and led to systemic state sanctioned abduction, torture, rape, and murder.  When Chile's military launched a coup to seize power from the failing socialist government, the junta did not revert to constitutional norms, as the country's right wing wished, but suspended the constitution and banned political parties and trade unions. Of Dominos and Dissidents For over a hundred years, Communism has been one of many totalitarian ideologies.  Fascists in Italy, Germany, and Spain were viciously anti-Communist.  The Nazi party believed Communism and Liberal Capitalism were two sides of the same Jewish coin.  During the Cold War, being anti-Communist was a convenient excuse for American endorsement.  Apartheid South Africa was very Protestant and very anti-Communist, fighting against Communists in Southern Africa to expand their influence.  Saddam's Iraq was anti-Communist, Baathists in Iraq and Syria considered Communists and Islamists to be their nemesis.  The Baathists despised the anti-religious character of Communism, and the anti-Nationalist character of political Islam. It was dangerous to be a Communist in America, just as it was dangerous to be a Liberal in the Soviet Union.  Both nations sought to subvert dissent, internally and externally, in spite of constitutional norms.
This intolerance at the cost of constitutional norms and freedoms wasn't just exported.  Between 1956 and 1971 the US government ran COINTELPRO, a secret and illegal project by the FBI to discredit and destroy political movements deemed a threat to the status quo.  The FBI was concerned about the rise of a 'black messiah'; a charismatic black liberation leader able to unite working class black and white communities, which would have significant political consequences for domestic and foreign policy.  Of the individuals the FBI considered possible candidates, most were killed (Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, Fred Hampton, the latter unambiguously murdered by law enforcement).  This wasn't the only time an American government would break their own rules to spite Communism, Iran-Contra being another obvious example. Many Americans however tolerated these abuses of power, because they feared Communism would deprive them of their economic and religious freedoms.  Domino Theory became an enduring way of rationalising Cold War paranoia.  According to this geopolitical hypothesis, Communism was essentially infectious, and its existence anywhere threatened to spill across borders.  This anxious conclusion guided policymaking for successive American governments, from Eisenhower to Reagan. The concern that Communism would take away American liberties wasn't without basis, as Communist states uniformly advocated state atheism, and mostly banned private ownership and freedom of expression.  Cuba undoubtedly contributed to an American belief that Communism meant economic collapse.  And yet, Fidel Castro's government had more in common ideologically with the French Revolution than the Russian.  Soviet advisors gave the new Cuban government economic advice... which was completely ignored.  The Cubans experimented with a uniquely Cuban sort of Communism.  They visited the Soviet Union and China, and found both models lacking.  Their own design was more far-left than the Soviet Union, and an unmitigated economic disaster. On the other side of the Iron Curtain, Soviet leaders were anxious that liberalisation would mean the end of Communism, and thus exploit the people via unregulated robber baron capitalism.  These concerns were not without basis either.  The threat of liberalisation, even within the context of an essentially Communist system (i.e. Czechoslovak 'Socialism with a Human Face'), invoked military interventions by Soviet forces on multiple occasions.  Notably: East Germany in 1953, Hungary in 1956, and Czechoslovakia in 1968. Both Communist and anti-Communist forces engaged in murder, torture, terror, and suppression of political freedoms and human rights.  So it can't just be that Communism suppresses political freedom or tortures its enemies.  The reason Americans disapprove of Communism is elsewhere: it is because of an emotional reaction to ideas which clash with those they have internalised. This also explains why Americans do not discuss things like Operation Condor, when weighing the question.  Regardless of the fact that any sort of dictatorship in Latin America (or elsewhere) is evil.  But one evil is regarded as more so because it is less familiar. For most Americans Communism is culturally incompatible."
Has there ever been a documented instance of the problem that net neutrality purports to solve?,"Yes, there was the case of Netflix and Comcast for example. The events were basically these: This example showed the validity of a new business model for ISPs: Have online content providers pay ISPs for better access by their customers. This would make it extremely difficult for newcomers on the market to compete against competitors who can afford to pay the ISPs. Further, ISPs could decide to flat out reject such a deal with specific content providers for any reason they want. This could be ethical concerns or business interests. Speaking of business interests, there is another business practice which is questionable from a net neutrality point of view: The zero rating. There is currently a good example for this in Germany. Monthly data caps on mobile internet usage are usually quite low in Germany. That makes it really expensive to use music or video streaming on the go. The solution by German ISP T-Mobile? Pay just a little bit extra and streaming no longer affects your monthly data cap usage. But initially only if you used their streaming services.  Under pressure from the Bundesnetzagentur (the regulatory body for data services in Germany) they caved in and offered the same zero rating for their main competitors on the media streaming market. But these are again unique deals which apply to specific competitors. Further, other ISPs in Germany (like Vodafone) have started to offer similar products. That means if anyone wants to offer a new streaming service, they would have to negotiate with all the ISPs (worldwide!) to also get a zero rating deal. This is a problem for small and specialized streaming startups who usually do not have the resources to do that."
"Why is President Trump making such a big deal about fake news, and specifically targeting reputable organizations like The New York Times and CNN?","TL;DR  I have been as bi-partisan as possible. President Trump is attempting to discredit the media as they attempt to expose aspects of his administration they find worthy of journalism. Some may be driven by editorial bias however the majority are reporting genuine news-worthy stories, often using direct statements and quotes from the Trump administration or Donald Trump himself. Due to the lack of experience of the administration they have made clumsy mistakes which look, at first glance, to demonstrate a lack of understanding of the US Constitution, political affairs, legal structure and general all-round US civics.  This is extremely embarrassing and de-legitimizes President Trump.  In response to being unable to prevent this, the President has attacked the media directly trying to erode their credibility and trust. The situation is made worse by the epidemic, as described by Trump, of information leaking to the Press from the judicial and law enforcement agencies, from the intelligence community, from the legislature and from Trump's own administration. When questioned, anonymous staffers have said that the leaks must continue as they uncover more and more information they believe should be in the hands of the populace. Reports are that Admin staff are now using an encrypted chat platform called Confide to leak material freely. His primary method of attack is to use the repetition of a simplistic phrase Fake News.  You are Fake News.  Failing Fake News. which plays well into the demographics of the voter base he is targeting; many of which distrust the Government or any suitably large organisation (which can be warranted given that the US Government engineered the biggest gold theft in history from the US populace) and ongoing cultural divisions between North and South USA. The Trump rhetoric is a lesser version of the message distributed by media outlets such as InfoWars.  They share the same demographic and espouse conspiracy theory, paranoia and fear of Government, which Trump alludes to frequently with the qualifier We don't know. We need to find out what's going on. In addition Trump uses the propaganda technique, what-about-ism which is a common tactic for deflecting criticism or oversight. Whataboutism is a term describing a propaganda technique used by the Soviet Union in its dealings with the Western world during the Cold War. When criticisms were levelled at the Soviet Union, the response would be ""What about..."" followed by the naming of an event in the Western world. It represents a case of tu quoque (appeal to hypocrisy), a logical fallacy which attempts to discredit the opponent's position by asserting the opponent's failure to act consistently in accordance with that position, without directly refuting or disproving the opponent's initial argument. Many of the media outlets targeted by the Trump administration are labelled as liberal which is a term used in the USA as a pejorative by non-liberal voters.
Some are, admittedly, outwardly liberal (CNN, Guardian) whilst others are attempting to strike a completely non-partisan reporting platform (BBC) although conspiracy theorists would argue otherwise. This is part of a wider trend showing that Democrats are becoming more liberal and Republicans are becoming more Conservative with the USA becoming more polarised. The Trump administration, and the President, have also sought to pivot the label ""fake news"" from referring to largely fabricated reports describing fantastical and untrue events which veer often into paranoid, anti-authority conspiracy theory to a more insidious label applied to the press corps as a whole; but also specifically any press institution classed as critical of the Trump administration. This approach allows the administration to avoid direct criticism of individual events and policies by simply labeling the entirety of the press fake and thus, anything they print or investigate is fake by proxy.  In doing so any nuanced investigation into any aspect of the Trump Presidency is smothered and overwhelmed as a figment of the fake news. There is a discernible pattern and correlation showing that fake news is primarily endorsed, shared and buoyed by right-wing voters.  Fake news / conspiracy theory often centers on anti-governance and dovetails with ideological views of Trump and right-wing voters meaning they are more susceptible to considering fake news websites as legitimate. known false news stories that appeared in the three months before the election, those favoring Trump were shared a total of 30 million times on Facebook, while those favoring Clinton were shared eight million times; ""Pope backs Trump"", ""Hillary sold weapons to ISIS"", ""FBI Agent Suspected in Hillary Email Leaks Found Dead"" - these fake headlines all went viral on Facebook in the run up to the election, gaining such high engagement that BuzzFeed published an analysis on how they had outperformed real news on Facebook. Donald Trump also courted conspiracy theories. Initially, he suggested Ted Cruz's father was involved in the assassination of JFK, perpetuated the myth of Obama not being born in the United States (which he later conceded) and repeatedly claimed climate change as a hoax all of which are the preserve of fake news websites. Trump's unpredictability and his fueling of distrust of his opponents led to a growth in fake news that was supportive of him which now flames a cycle of de-legitimizing the established press making the term fake news essentially meaningless and more of a stick to beat the mainstream press with than a phenomenon in itself. Donald Trump said recently that ""any negative polls are fake news"". There is considerable historical precedence to suggest that Trump is engaging in a wider de-legitimising of the Press in preparation for a wider assault on the Constitution, of which a free press, is a cornerstone. Trump has continually referred to Fascist rhetoric directly (Drain the Swamp was from Mussolini) and he refers to the ""lying press"" daily which was also an early tactic of Adolf Hitler.  In additional, many of his policies have been echoed in Fascist leaders throughout history but that deconstruction is for another post. Mussolini established a High Commission for the press in the spring of 1929. Insisting that the Commission would not interfere with the freedom of the press, Mussolini’s Keeper of the Seals, Alfredo Rocco, nevertheless maintained an exception for “any activity contrary to the national interest,” “faithfulness to the Fatherland” naturally assuming the position of ultimate importance. Journalists were, like all other professions, encouraged to see their
occupation as one of many forms of service to the nation, to
participate actively in the education and inculcation of the Italian
people. Right now, it is clear that far from embracing a transparent White House administration and striking a conciliatory tone with the free press of the world, Donald Trump is doubling down on his attacks and is taking punitive measures against what he considers to be a hostile actor in the 2017 United States of America. Whether you consider the press hostile to Donald Trump or hostile to the USA is largely a question of your cultural upbringing and voter persuasion but a case to suggest Breitbart is a better custodian of Democratic First amendment rights rather than the BBC or the New York Times is nonexistent. For instance, the New York Times, established in 1851, continually printed in New York, has won over 120 Pulitzer Prizes; more than any other newspaper organisation. It is considered a ""Newspaper of Record"" along with the LA Times, the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal. One whose editorial and news-gathering functions are considered professional and typically authoritative. However, a number of historians and commentators have begun to draw parallels and conclusions from the timing of Donald Trump's outbursts and attacks. It appears that the most memorable attacks, often considered buffoonery, are synchronised with serious legislative events and revelations which become buried behind the latest ""tweet-rage"".  This is speculation but not unprecedented. There is a growing trend in reporting questioning the mental health of Donald Trump.  Supporters of the President claim this is a distraction and unprovoked attack however in recent weeks more and more psychiatric and psychologist specialists have been speaking up using various news agencies and platforms to express alarm at his erratic behaviour.    For instance, in a letter to the New York Times, 35 mental health professionals warned that the ""grave emotional instability"" indicated in Mr Trump's speech and actions made him ""incapable of serving safely as president"". But the majority of mental health professionals have refrained from making public statements, following a self-imposed principle known as the ""Goldwater rule"", adopted by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) in 1973. His attacks on the press are held as further indicators that he takes negative reporting about him or his administration extremely seriously and he cannot refocus on his task at hand until he has launched a counter-offensive against the aggrieving party. This is further evidence from mental health professionals that Donald Trump may lack the restraint required for the Commander in Chief role, a situation exacerbated by his continued endorsement of ideas which are best labelled as conspiracy theory. So far, Trump's approach to the media, labelled as the MSM (Mainstream Media) by predominantly right-wing and/or libertarian demographics has played well with his core voter base who believe that the media bloc are part of a larger coordinated conspiracy against him and the right wing in general. For instance; the Financial Times reports Mr Trump’s most recent Gallup approval rating was 88 per cent among Republicans, which is historically normal, or even good, for a president within his own party. Even after a chaotic first month characterised by protests, the shambolic rollout of a travel ban, cabinet shake-ups and allegations of contacts with Russia, a dedicated core of US adults continues to approve of the job the president is doing. This has culminated in the Republican Party releasing the ""Mainstream Media Accountability Survey"" which asks a series of questions focusing on the alleged shortcomings of the press, naming some media outlets. Unfortunately for the President, his attacks are having the opposite effect as intended in the wider USA.  Voter trust in the media is rising, almost daily, and the Legislature are becoming increasingly alarmed at his rhetoric. Though he is polling better among his own party than some predecessors were at the same time including Bush and Reagan, Mr Trump’s overall approval rating remains lower than that of every other president soon after inauguration, at least since polling data became available in 1945. The main difference is that Mr Trump’s approval ratings among non-Republicans are much lower than other presidents. Most tellingly, his daily claims that media outlets are failing (NYT especially) is being soundly rebutted by business reports showing the New York Times is showing rapid growth in subscriber numbers and quarterly profitability as well a stock price surge to the highest in 2.5 years. His refusal to accept even basic facts is not helping his image as balanced and able to accept criticism; in fact, it paints a picture of a man creating his own reality around him in direct opposition to facts, truth and empirical evidence. Part of the left and right divide comes from where Americans get their information. Last year, Fox News, the top news choice for Trump voters, became the most-watched cable news network on US television, surpassing the sports network ESPN for the first time. Nearly nine in 10 consistently conservative respondents told Pew they trusted Fox News, while only 6 per cent of consistently liberal respondents said the same. Mainstream news outlets reported on Mr Trump’s low inauguration
turnout compared to Mr Obama’s 2009 inauguration. According to a poll
that week, fewer than a third of Trump voters agreed that Mr Obama had
a larger turnout. This information gap translates to tangible differences in the
opinions US voters hold. In early February, Trump adviser Kellyanne
Conway mistakenly said that two Iraqi refugees perpetrated “the
Bowling Green massacre”. No Bowling Green massacre ever occurred, a
fact that many mainstream news outlets reported, but a majority of
Trump voters still told pollsters that the non-existent massacre is
why the US needs Mr Trump’s immigration executive order."
Why is the Trump Administration often labeled as anti-science?,"Evidence That Trump Is Anti-Science There is plenty of evidence that the Trump administration is anti-science. For example: One of his first acts in office was to place a gag order on federal scientists reporting their results and removing their past scientific reports from government websites. Trump denies empirical evidence that torture is not an effective interrogation method. He appointed a Secretary of Education who thinks that schools funded with public dollars should teach Christian doctrine, something that has consistently involved rejection of evolution in favor of creationism. He appointed a climate change denier as head of the EPA. More generally, his EPA appointee denies many well documented scientific links between pollution and public health harms. He has proposed deep budget cuts to science funding in the National Institute of Health (NIH), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the Department of Energy (DOE), and directed funding away from Earth oriented climate research in the National Aeronautic and Space Administration (NASA). He insists that vaccines are connected to autism. He has appointed an attorney-general who has discontinued efforts to improve the accuracy of forensic science in criminal investigations to reduce wrongful convictions: Attorney General Jeff Sessions will end a Justice Department
  partnership with independent scientists to raise forensic science
  standards and has suspended an expanded review of FBI testimony across
  several techniques that have come under question, saying a new
  strategy will be set by an in-house team of law enforcement advisers. In a statement Monday, Sessions said he would not renew the National
  Commission on Forensic Science, a roughly 30-member advisory panel of
  scientists, judges, crime lab leaders, prosecutors and defense lawyers
  chartered by the Obama administration in 2013. His attorney-general has also supported empirically untrue statements about marijuana, for example, stating that heroin and marijuana are equally harmful. Evidence That Conservatives Are Anti-Science The connection between U.S. conservatives and the anti-science movement is real and is largely a product of the strong ties between U.S. conservative politics and Evangelical Christianity (see generally the links in this article on the topic).  These ties started to develop when Republican Presidential candidate Barry Goldwater adopted a Southern strategy, but Nixon established the EPA and Trump SCOTUS appointee Neil Gorsuch's mother lead that agency. The Evangelical merger with conservative Republican politics really took hold in the 1980s. There are particular points of contention including: the teaching of creationism in schools (see above), Republicans in the rank and file are also more creationist in their beliefs,  support for abstinence only education which has been empirically proven not to work,  taking the position that birth-control and abortion are equivalent (see also this article and the links therein), denial of climate change,  faith healing (especially denying children modern medical care under the rubric of parental rights),  embrace of scientifically false statements that rape cannot cause pregnancy, rejection of the use of forensic science to exonerate the wrongfully convicted (see above), opposition to stem cell research: [O]n every poll measure for which data are available, Republicans are
  less supportive than Democrats. About half of Republicans favor
  medical research involving embryonic stem cells (52%) and believe that
  such research should not be forbidden (51%), as compared with two
  thirds (67%) of Democrats on each of these measures (VCU 2010; HSPH
  2011). On the question of federal funding, a majority (58%) of
  Republicans expressed opposition, whereas a majority (70%) of
  Democrats said they were in favor (CNN-ORC 2010). insistence that sexual orientation is a choice and not a biological disposition, and in the same vein that homosexuality is a disorder to be cured with therapy (which has been shown to be very harmful to its subjects), while I was a professor I had one of my conservative students object to teaching scientific evidence on Alzheimer's disease and other mental health conditions in connection with testamentary capacity because she subscribed to the demon possession theory of mental health espoused in the New Testament, conservative claims that natural disasters and diseases are God's wrath. Anti-Science Positions On The Left There are absolutely anti-science positions on the left as well as the right, although the claim that there are more than two human genders in nature is not one of them. Gender is a term different than sex, and incorporates not just biological anatomy or gender chromosomes but realities like sexual orientation and transgender identities, both of which exist and are probably congenital if not genetic. The left tends to underplay the fact that there are meaningful sex differences both physically and psychologically. The left tends to overstate the extent to which race lacks a biological component. While it is correct that definitions of race vary culturally and the meaning of race varies, it tends to ignore the obvious fact that sociological race is heavily correlated (in part due to history) with the geographic place of origin of one's ancestors and that geographic ancestry can be ascertained with genetics in an objective manner. The left tends to have exaggerated perceptions of the environmental and safety risks of nuclear power and genetically modified organisms. The left tends to have exaggerated perceptions of the benefits of organic agriculture and to understate the benefits of non-organic agriculture and GMOs in preventing world hunger. The left tends to be unduly skeptical of the reality of IQ as a construct and of the extent to which IQ is hereditary. Anti-vaccination sentiment is not unique to liberals or conservatives. (Of course, it is perfectly possible for more than one political party to share a particular anti-science opinion.) But, despite specific policy-driven instances, the political left, in general, tends to have much more trust in the scientific establishment and a more positive attitude towards science. Scientists and the Political Left Are Not Mutually Exclusive Many allegations (from, for example, Fox News and political
  commentators such as Ben Shapiro) indicate that the Science March of
  2017 is organized and promoted not by scientists, but by US left wing
  politics instead. The notion that scientists and the US left-wing politics are exclusive of each other that this statement assumes, is false. Many scientists, either by happenstance or as a result of their experience as scientists are part of the political left in the U.S. and it is hardly crazy to think that the March on Science could be organized by people who are both scientists with wide backing in the scientific establishment and active in the political left in the U.S. with wide backing in that community. This is not to say that there are not any conservative scientists (although only 6% of scientists identify as Republican), by all means there are and indeed on most college campuses, the sciences tend to be relative ""safe spaces"" for conservatives among faculty and students alike. But, scientists are, for example, systemically less religious than non-scientists, and non-religious people are far more likely to lean left in their politics than right, although there are exceptions (e.g. noted blogger and conservative atheist Razib Khan)."
How did Trump's January 6 speech call for insurrection and violence?,"The article of impeachment introduced by Democrats in the House on January 11th specifically mentions parts of President Trump's January 6th speech (emphasis mine): Shortly before the Joint Session commenced, President Trump, addressed
a crowd at the Ellipse in Washington, DC. There, he reiterated false
claims that ""we won this election, and we won it by a landslide"". He
also willfully made statements that, in context, encouraged - and
foreseeably resulted in - lawless action at the Capitol, such as: ""if
you don’t fight like hell you’re not going to have a country anymore"".
Thus incited by President Trump, members of the crowd he had
addressed, in an attempt to, among other objectives, interfere with
the Joint Session’s solemn constitutional duty to certify the results
of the 2020 Presidential election, unlawfully breached and vandalized
the Capitol, injured and killed law enforcement personnel, menaced
Members of Congress, the Vice President, and Congressional personnel,
and engaged in other violent, deadly, destructive, and seditious acts. The wider context of this quote, and the transcript of Trump's speech in full, can be found here: Our brightest days are before us, our greatest achievements still
wait. I think one of our great achievements will be election security
because nobody until I came along, had any idea how corrupt our
elections were. And again, most people would stand there at 9:00 in
the evening and say, “I want to thank you very much,” and they go off
to some other life, but I said, “Something’s wrong here. Something’s
really wrong. Can’t have happened.” And we fight. We fight like Hell

As far as the allegations by House Democrats of incitement of insurrection go, this extract from his speech seems to be the main focus, although the article of impeachment is not solely in response to his speech on Jan 6th, and also mentions his prior conduct such as his phone call with the Georgia Secretary of State on January 2nd."
Why is populism seen as being negative or bad?,"Populism suggests emotion over reason to many. The negative connotation of the term populism respects the dichotomy of emotion vs. reason as it relates to public policy and its effect on political decision-making — particularly voting. Emotion is seen by many as a less-reliable basis for creating public policy (and decision-making in general) than reason because emotion often overweights fears and biases and underweights facts and logic. Therefore, candidates described as populists are often also (more pejoratively) called demagogues. And, accordingly, can be perceived as playing upon the emotional fears and biases of their constituents for their own political benefit at the expense of the very constituency who might elect them. a political leader who seeks support by appealing to popular desires and prejudices rather than by using rational argument. [Source] This dichotomy between emotion and reason was acknowledged at least as far back as the founding of the United States and the framing of the Constitution. It is, for example, why the structure of the bicameral legislature (Congress) was designed the way it was. The House of Representatives was supposed to be closer to the people and, therefore, more emotional. Hence, fewer constituents on average and a shorter term (two years) vs. six years in the Senate which was supposed to be calmer and more rational.  The above figure is a widely used metaphor for Congress. The House is depicted as the cup of hot liquid (emotional) and the Senate as the saucer (supplying a tempered, reasoned, cooling effect). The web site of the U.S. Senate describes the following dialog between Washington and Jefferson: George Washington is said to have told [Thomas] Jefferson, ""the framers had created the Senate to 'cool' House legislation just as a saucer was used to cool hot tea.""

Why do European cities have so many homeless and beggars despite its high-tax welfare system?,"I also wondered why there are homeless people in my home-country Germany even though the social safety system is legally obligated to pay the rent for people who can not afford to do so. In this case, the rent is paid directly by the municipal government to the landlord, so there is no way to misappropriate those funds. So I did some research regarding the reasons for homelessness in Germany.  Most sources are obviously in German, so please excuse that I am not able to provide any good English sources. This answer is based on an articles by Nothilfe Mensch e. V., (a charity organization which helps homeless people), an article by the Diakonie (a church-based charity organization) and an article by Brand Eins (an economic magazine). These sources point out that there are many ways to become homeless, but there is one path to homelessness which seems quite typical: Part of the eviction process is that the landlord needs to notify the social security bureau, who then send a letter to the tenant and inform them about what help they are entitled to. A ""normal"" person would then make an appointment with the bureau and file a request to have them pay the rent. But some people apparently don't do this. Why? Remember that we are talking about people with severe mental health problems here who are completely overwhelmed by their life situation. In order to obtain help from the social security bureau, they need to open that letter and reply to it. A letter which is usually found among unpayable invoices, legal threats and other problems they really can not deal with right now. In order to receive the help from the state they are legally entitled to, they actually need to become active and request it. This can be a difficult barrier for some people."
Why are green parties so often opposed to nuclear power?,"Burning fossil fuels has a negative impact on the environment. This impact is relatively well understood and predictable. Nuclear power may have a negative impact on the environment, both when the fuel rods and reactors reach their end of life and when accidents happen. The problems of radioactive waste disposal are not solved and accidents are unpredictable, uncommon, but severe. So one might well make the case that nuclear power is the lesser evil, but many environmentalist parties want to stop both.  Here is what the German Greens have to say:   1) Leave the climate-detrimental coal. [...]
  5) [...] Nuclear power is an unpredicably risky technology. [...]"
Why don't Presidential debates disable the candidates' microphones while it's not their turn to speak?,"Just a theory: previous Presidential debates were conducted with greater civility, and that civility functioned as a sort of automatic inner software mute switch that was already installed (via education) in the conscience of each candidate.  There were occasional interjections now and then, but not enough to impede the general flow of the Presidential debate format. So there was never before a need for a hardware mute switch... until the format met with a candidate without that software mute switch."
Why were pre-election polls and forecast models inconsistent with the election of Donald Trump?,"Reasonable theories I have heard have included: A change in polling foundations (home phones become cell phones = limitations on traditional cold calling... and also the shift into online polls).  Plus perhaps the diminishing patience people have with enduring the polling process (I believe the percentage of people who agree to it has dropped consistently) A hesitation/fear that keeps some people from admitting that they support a candidate who is being widely presented as detestable/deplorable in much of the public discussion/media.  [apparently an effect common enough to have a term, see the Shy Tory Factor... the possibility it might be important was even presciently suggested in a question here a couple weeks ago] A possible tendency for people to publicly show full support for minority/heroic candidates because it's the socially favorable thing to do, even when they're actually entertaining uncertainty internally.  [this is along the lines of the Bradley Effect] People failing to turn out as they've indicated they will... perhaps due to weather (though it's fairly unlikely this was a big factor in this election), a false sense of security (such as when the polls in the days leading up to and into election day suggest a comfortable victory!), or just a general failure to muster the effort/will to follow through with the voting. Regardless, there is a widespread trend of polls failing recently, and maybe even specifically underestimating the conservative side.  In 2015, the UK Parliament was projected to come out about even between the top two parties, but the conservatives won by over 5%, ending up with the majority (which was considered to be a near 0% chance possibility as the day began), this summer Brexit passed (considered almost certain to fail as the day began, ended up passing by 4%), and last month the Colombian Peace Referendum failed (after being consistently polled to pass by about 10%).  So perhaps this is a trend to be aware of going forward until polling methods can hopefully adapt.  Others here have also pointed out there was an underforecast conservative swing in the 2016 Iceland election and changes in the Swedish election. Note, though, that most models showing the full spread of possibilities didn't say this was a set Clinton win, but that it leaned maybe 70-80% likely that Clinton would win.
A 1 out of 5 chance of being wrong is not insignificant...
If they say there's a 20% chance of rain today, you shouldn't be surprised if it does rain!  In meteorology we've often got the same continuing struggles, particularly when it comes to issues like hurricane/storm forecasting; getting people to understand the uncertainty and full potentials of realistic possibilities.  This is something we should keep on our media to better portray to us, and something school math courses could better focus on, perhaps being of significant benefit to a great many. Considering that most polls have maybe a 4-6% typical error, this result was really quite within the range of possibility for most (although their consistent bias suggests that there really are some fundamental shortcomings).  But, still, most of the quality election forecasters did also measure in some considerations of this trend towards less poll reliability, and were urging caution regarding overconfidence in the indicated spread (as Nate Silver of fivethirtyeight did here on election morning)."
"Why is it considered racist to say ""White Lives Matter""?","The best statement I've seen of the argument for saying ""Black Lives Matter"" is in a letter to The Columbus Dispatch from Stanley D. Krider, posted July 25, 2020: I say “Black Lives Matter” because “All” didn’t include Blacks when
whites said “All men are created equal.” I say “Black Lives Matter” because “All” didn’t include Blacks when
whites said “With liberty and justice for all.” I say “Black Lives Matter” because “All” didn’t include Blacks when
whites said “All men have the right to vote.” The point of ""Black Lives Matter"" is a claim that US policies and practices, especially in policing, do not always treat ""All Lives Matter"" as fully including Blacks. Saying ""Black Lives Matter"" is a way of reminding people that the ""All"" in ""All Lives Matter"" must include Blacks. Given the history quoted above of ""All"" not effectively including Blacks, there are grounds for suspecting that those who push ""All Lives Matter"" are trying to preserve that exclusion, and support a status quo in which Black lives are not treated as mattering as much as the lives of lighter skinned people. ""White Lives Matter"" goes even further in supporting unequal treatment, in practice, of Blacks in many situations."
Why does religion get a special treatment in anti-discrimination laws?,"You are looking at this through the eyes of a modern. Time for some history: One of the oldest European settlements on North America was made by Puritans, who were fleeing... government religious persecution*. One of the most influential groups in the formation of America were the Quakers, who came to America fleeing... government religious persecution. The American Founding Fathers were (with a few notable exceptions) men of faith, and since they came primarily from various different and somewhat incompatible flavors of Christianity or generic deism and since there was a long history of flight from governmental religious persecution in their political DNA they wisely decided to prohibit the government from persecuting religions. What constitutes a real religion as opposed to not is a hole with no bottom: categories are inherently fuzzy. But in practice they've been able to make it work well enough. So religion enjoys special protection primarily because it's a historically at-risk group for persecution, especially by other religions. Which means that such protections are still relevant, they prevent a powerful religion from oppressing members of a less powerful faith."
"Why is it that Bernie Sanders is always called a ""socialist""?","Basically Bernie Sanders used the wrong term and it stuck. For some unfathomable reason, he refers to himself as a socialist while espousing policies that are clearly social Democrat in line with most European states. He has done himself no favors. If he had said social democrat, he wouldn't have received as much McCarthy-ist style attacks. He is definitely espousing a European style model rather than a Venezuelan style model. Because of his mistake, the term's meaning has changed, and now others like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are calling themselves socialists too even though they're not.
The DSA themselves also describe themselves in terms that sound a lot more like social democracy than democratic socialism.  Bernie's key policy positions are all Medicare For All, lowering prescription drug prices, a jobs program to shift America's energy production rapidly towards green energy, and tuition free public colleges. I could source this, but he says it in literally every speech or interview he's ever done, so that would be a bit redundant! Bernie Sanders gave a great interview in 2006 with Democracy Now where he explained his version of socialism. You can compare that with the DSA position linked above."
Why couldn't Republicans who voted to repeal Obamacare so many times under Obama do it under a Republican president?,"Why couldn't they pass a single one of their many, previously-successful proposals under a Republican president? The simple answer is that you're measuring ""successful"" by how many votes were garnered in Congress.  This is a slippery measure. Voting to repeal the Affordable Care Act when the sitting President (Obama) is guaranteed to veto your repeal is merely a political gesture.  It says, ""I abdicate responsibility for any negative effects of Obamacare, because I voted to repeal it!"" When the President (Trump) is actually likely to pass your repeal, then you can no longer just make political statements; you must consider the consequences more carefully. This answer purposely does not address the question of whether a repeal would be a good thing or a bad thing in terms of economic consequences. I only refer to the perceived consequences for political careers, as perceived by members of Congress.  They may or may not even perceive them correctly; I am not judging that either. Put another way: Voting for a bill to repeal Obamacare that is subsequently approved by the President, puts Congress ""on the hook"" for the consequences of the repeal. Voting for a repeal that is vetoed takes Congress off the hook for any negative effects of the Affordable Care Act. One involves abdicating responsibility, the other involves assuming responsibility for potentially negative consequences. That's politics for you."
Why does the pardon of Arpaio show contempt for the rule of law?,"tl;dr: Arpaio was sentenced for violating a court order, which ordered him to stop violating the law. In this case, a presidential pardon takes away any recourse the judiciary has, thus circumventing the separation of powers and thus the rule of law. Few people claim that the pardon was illegal. What people mean by ""rule of law"" in this case is that it was against the unwritten, but well established, procedure of pardons and an attack against the separation of powers. Specifically, the pardon violated - not legally binding - procedures because: Additionally, the pardon is generally applied when one or more of these points apply: None of those is the case here. Arpaio is proud of his racist and criminal behavior, and wasn't sentenced yet, so nothing has changed since his sentencing. Because of this, the pardon is perceived not as righting a previous wrong, or as mercy for a person showing regret, but as going over a judge. In many democracies, state powers are separated into Legislative, Executive, and Judicial powers. Rule of law specifically means: the legal principle that law should govern a nation, as opposed to being governed by decisions of individual government officials. It primarily refers to the influence and authority of law within society, particularly as a constraint upon behaviour, including behaviour of government officials. While the pardon itself may have been legal, Trump circumvented the checks the judiciary could exercise over the executive (of which Arpaio was a part of). The law that prevented Arpaio from his illegal activities can be considered bypassed; It wasn't the law that governed, but Arpaio. Trumps pardon of him - without any sign of guilt or wrongdoing - is a support of Arpaio's ignorance of the law, and thus in conflict with the principal of rule of law. Martin Redish shows in the NYT why this pardon is an attack on the existing process, the separation of power, and thus the rule of law: This is uncharted territory. Yes, on its face the Constitution’s pardon power would seem unlimited. [...] But the Arpaio case is different: The sheriff was convicted of violating constitutional rights, in defiance of a court order involving racial profiling. Should the president indicate that he does not think Mr. Arpaio should be punished for that, he would signal that governmental agents who violate judicial injunctions are likely to be pardoned, even though their behavior violated constitutional rights, when their illegal actions are consistent with presidential policies. Many legal scholars argue that the only possible redress is impeachment — itself a politicized, drawn-out process. But there may be another route. If the pardon is challenged in court, we may discover that there are, in fact, limits to the president’s pardon power after all. [...] [I]f the president signals to government agents that there exists the likelihood of a pardon when they violate a judicial injunction that blocks his policies, he can all too easily circumvent the only effective means of enforcing constitutional restrictions on his behavior. Indeed, the president could even secretly promise a pardon to agents if they undertake illegal activity he desires. [...] [I]f the president can employ the pardon power to circumvent constitutional protections of liberty, there is very little left of the constitutional checks on presidential power. Noah Feldman argues the same on Bloomberg: This is the crime that Trump is suggesting he might pardon: willful defiance of a federal judge’s lawful order to enforce the Constitution. It’s one thing to pardon a criminal out of a sense of mercy or on the belief that he has paid his debt to society. It’s trickier when the president pardons someone who violated the law in pursuit of governmental policy [...] But it would be an altogether different matter if Trump pardoned Arpaio for willfully refusing to follow the Constitution and violating the rights of people inside the U.S. Such a pardon would reflect outright contempt for the judiciary, which convicted Arpaio for his resistance to its authority. Trump has questioned judges’ motives and decisions, but this would be a further, more radical step in his attack on the independent constitutional authority of Article III judges. An Arpaio pardon would express presidential contempt for the Constitution. [...] Fundamentally, pardoning Arpaio would also undermine the rule of law itself. Most of the outrage is of course not (only) because of the contempt for the rule of law, but because this isn't the first time Trump has shown his support for racists and white supremacists. And even those that agree with Trumps endorsement of white supremacists might agree that Arpaio was not a very decent person by any definition. Paul Krugman argues along those lines in an opinion piece in the NYT. He also gives an overview over Arpaios conviction and how this pardon might affect future investigations (and thus again attack the rule of law): Joe Arpaio engaged in blatant racial discrimination. His officers systematically targeted Latinos, often arresting them on spurious charges and at least sometimes beating them up when they questioned those charges. [...] Once Latinos were arrested, bad things happened to them. Many were sent to Tent City, which Arpaio himself proudly called a “concentration camp,” [...] And when he received court orders to stop these practices, he simply ignored them, which led to his eventual conviction — after decades in office — for contempt of court [...] Arpaio is, of course, a white supremacist. [...] Trump’s motives are easy to understand. For one thing, Arpaio, with his racism and authoritarianism, really is his kind of guy. For another, the pardon is a signal to those who might be tempted to make deals with the special investigator as the Russia probe closes in on the White House: Don’t worry, I’ll protect you. [...]"
Why does there seem to be a lack of conservative comedy and comedy-news compared to liberal?,"A liberal/conservative divide happens between sparsely-populated rural areas and dense urban ones, with the rural settings more likely to be conservative, and the urban ones more likely to be liberal. I won't get into the reasons why that is, but given that mass media has historically required a large number of people with a wide variety of talents that tend to fit better into cities (a stagehand in a small town wouldn't be able to make enough to do that full-time, whereas one in NYC very well could), mass media itself has grown up as a thing of the cities, and thus of liberal thinking.  Humor is by no means a 'liberal' thing, but due to the way a comedian's career tends to play out (larger and larger in-person venues, to TV specials, to fat-man-skinny-wife sitcom, and ideally parlayed into an acting career), it tends to mirror the tendencies in mass media. You are more likely to find an audience that likes your humor in a big city, you are more likely to be paid enough to do comedy for longer periods, and you are more likely to be able to pursue careers that don't focus on general necessities of life (like comedy). So while humor isn't a liberal/conservative thing, the process of becoming a comedian (in the vein of John Stewart/John Oliver/Stephen Colbert) is heavily biased towards those willing to spend their lives in large cities.

"Why is Trump dubbing COVID-19 as the ""Chinese virus"" considered offensive, while many past epidemics have had similar naming schemes?","Let's appreciate the learning curve. The problem with all of those historical names is that they created sharp spikes in prejudice, social ostracism, and violence against the indicated groups, and still create issues today as seen here with COVID-19. It's true that the first identified cases of Covid-19 occurred in Wuhan China, but this does not imply that people of Chinese descent — or even people recently emigrated from China — are vectors for the disease, or in any way responsible for the problems that the disease causes. But in the minds of an unfortunate number of ignorant people, the mere association of the disease with Chinese heritage can produce verbal and physical assaults, and/or other social pressures that can prevent Chinese people in any walk of life from getting access to necessities or essential services.  Trump's very public insistence on calling this the 'Chinese virus', backed by his status as president, is guaranteed to significantly increase acts of discrimination and assault on people of Asian descent (whether or not they are specifically Chinese). It guarantees this merely by giving an authoritative affirmation to the most panicked, emotional, and ignorant portion of our society that those 'Chinese' are in some way responsible for the spread of Covid-19. No doubt Trump does this intentionally. Trump thrives on the panicked, angry ignorance of others; that emotional state he knows how to manipulate to his own profit. And while he himself may not be concerned with the secondary impact of increased violence against people of Asian descent, people of Asian descent have a good deal to worry about. A president ought to have the presence of mind not to inflame racial tensions in a situation where tensions are already running exceedingly high. Even if we wanted to argue that there is nothing terribly wrong with the phrasing in and of itself — that it's just a poor choice of words by a man whom no one considers to be eloquent, perhaps — misstatements by someone who is (ostensibly) the leader of the free world have significant consequences. If even one Asian American gets attacked because of someone emboldened by Trump's poor word choice, that is blood on Trump's hands."
What are the main reasons for why negotiating a proper Brexit deal has been so hard?,"it was generally expected that the pro-Brexit politicians had some idea of how negotiations for a Brexit deal would fare and what the outcome would be. Who by? Everyone knew the lead Brexit team (Boris Johnson, Jacob Rees-Mogg et al) had no plans for how this would work. They didn't even have any grasp of how much things currently cost, never mind how anything would be affected in future. The assumption by Brexiteers was entirely that Europe would have more to lose by losing UK trade than the UK would. So Brexit supporters claimed that the EU would grant us special deals, because they couldn't afford to lose that trade. The EU said that this was never going to happen, and a year later, the UK have found that the EU meant what they said. Theresa May might genuinely have the best deal available; the EU has no reason to compromise, because the UK has nothing they want that badly. For a few examples... The most significant trade for the UK is in banking services, and Frankfurt, Paris and Amsterdam will be more than happy to take that off us. Unlike heavy industry, office-based jobs like banking can be moved almost overnight: the physical infrastructure required is minimal; people at more senior levels in banking are already happy to move anywhere in the world; and for those who aren't, there's no shortage of ""talent"" in every country in the world to step in. Issues with the Irish border and the Good Friday Agreement were widely reported in the press. The Brexit team said that it wouldn't come to this, but presented no ideas for how it would work. There still isn't a good solution. The UK losing all science backing from the EU, as one of the main beneficiaries of research funding, was widely reported too. That's already happened, even before Brexit. So too was the lack of key medical facilities, in particular radioisotopes for cancer treatment, and there's still no news about that as far as I know. The UK civil service itself fact-checked the claims of Brexiteers and the effects of Brexit, and showed that all these were inevitable consequences. Remainers checked too, of course, but the key part is that government departments checked on the impact on their own systems and reported the problems they'd face. No Brexiteer presented plans for them at the time. So no, I'm afraid you're starting from a false premise that anyone who looked at the evidence could have thought the Brexit faction had any clue as to how these issues would be resolved. By definition, if you informed yourself then you could not think this was the case. I wouldn't dispute that people might have thought independence outweighed the impact of all these issues. You might guess that I'd disagree, of course, but it's a valid opinion and I respect the integrity of people with that opinion. Thinking that the Brexiteers had solutions though, simply because you can't imagine politicians causing this level of chaos to further their own careers - that's just wishful thinking."
Why is the climate change debate so often framed in terms of whether or not it's due to human activity?,"The reason is that if climate change would not be human-caused, then humans would not be able to prevent it by scaling down their greenhouse gas emissions.  The chain of reasoning which is most supported by the scientific data we currently have available (check earth science stackexchange for more information) is: But when our industry would not be responsible for the raise in global temperature, that chain of reasoning would be irrelevant: As you can see, the answer to the question about whether or not climate change is man-made has a direct impact on which policies should be enacted to solve this problem.  There are people who have a direct business interest in preventing any policies which would reduce greenhouse gas emissions, because these would have a negative financial impact on them. There are also people who have ideological reasons for opposing government-imposed economy regulations. The best way to prevent these policies from being enacted is to cast doubt on the causality chain outlined above."
Why hasn't competition between health insurance providers led to lower prices for consumers?,"What the other answers fail to address is a fundamental flaw in capitalism for certain types of business:  Your average human places their continued survival above all other priorities. This concept is called 'inelastic demand'. In order for supply and demand to work properly, both entities need to be free to disengage and seek other options. But when one's life and/or well-being are at immediate risk, fear of death and/or disability clouds our judgment towards rational analysis of our situation, and thus puts healthcare providers in a position of power over us. Likewise, the fear of future death and/or disability versus financial ruin or loss of coverage can put health insurance companies in a position of power over us.  So while I might shop around for a good car and allow my current car to become less-than-ideal while I wait for a good opportunity, I will not gamble with my life or the life of my family, and thus if I only have two options for healthcare, I will invariably pick one of those two rather than wait for something better to come along.

What is the capitalist answer to automation?,"In 1800, more than 90% of everyone were farmers.  Modernly in the United States, which is a net exporter of food, less than 5% of everyone are employed on farms.  That's a reduction of 85%, much higher than 45%.  Far from causing the end of capitalism, it launched the industrial age.   In short, the capitalist answer is that there is always something else that people could be doing.  Police departments could hire more police.  Hospitals could hire more nurses.  Automation leads to higher wages which leads to more consumption of other things:  maid services; landscaping; construction; other things that don't have names because we haven't created them yet.   When I was young, we had a refrigerator, oven, washer, dryer, phone, television, and several radios.  We added a microwave, a computer, and a VCR.  Now, that VCR is already obsolete and replaced by Blu Ray players and DVRs (or the internet).  And people each have their own phone, computer, and television (which may also be the phone or computer).   Capitalism can't tell what the future holds.  But looking at the past, it can guess that the future holds something.  Because our previous responses to automation has always been to find new and different things to do.  "
Why are states purportedly performing assassinations with chemical and radioactive weapons?,"The reasons given by @zidadawatimmy's answer aren't wrong, but the points made in the original post are also well taken. As your decision to post this question in this forum illustrates, this is also a quintessentially political act. These chemical and radioactive weapons seem unusual, complicated, and
  draw attention. This is a feature and not a bug. Another analysis is that it is intended that the organizations behind these hits are unambiguous and that each hit is intended to send a loud and clear message to others similarly situated about who is ready, able and willing to kill you if you don't behave. When you choose to kill with polonium-210 or a nerve gas agent, you are making it unambiguously clear that this is an officially sanctioned killing by an agency of a sovereign government that has access to these kinds of weapons. There is no room to suppose that this was a hit ordered by a jealous lover, or as a consequence of a drug deal gone bad, or by an anti-government faction. The method, together with the identity of the victim and to the extent discernible (as in the Korean case where the dupes who actually carried out the killing swiftly reported that their handler was Korean IIRC) the ethnicity of the perpetrator, leaves little room for reasonable doubt regarding who is responsible, short of an official public statement that the government carried out the killing, which even then could be doubted. Also, the novelty of the method of assassination ensures that the hit becomes international news that is available to everyone else whom that government might want to exert pressure upon in the future (and a link to a verifiable third-party news clip could send the same message to hermits living on rocks who didn't catch this news the first time around). These are all individuals who are being assassinated for suspected or actual disloyalty or insubordination of some form, and a public identifiable, high profile hit tells others who might consider disloyalty or insubordination that even if it seems like they are in the clear, that they can be made to suffer a horrible death at any time as a consequence of their disloyalty or insubordination and that the agency of the sovereign government to whom they owe loyalty won't hesitate to do it. It demonstrates that this agency has no scruples when it comes to disciplining its own. After a few incidents like this, a mere photograph of the recipient or a member of their family, sent in a letter postmarked in a city associated with the agency to which the recipient might consider being disloyal or insubordinate could be enough to trigger terror in that person sufficient to secure their obedience, because it would demonstrate that they have the ability to kill the recipient since they know where the recipient lives. Essentially, this is the same kind of showy, disgust inducing tactic seen in similarly overblown killings in fictional stories like the delivery of the dead horse head in The Godfather, or even more gory acts in the same vein in Game of Thrones. The Latin phrase associated with this tactic when used in the Roman empire by some of its less scrupulous Caesars was: Oderint Dum Metuant (""Let them hate so long as they fear."")"
Why is a border wall such a polarising issue in American politics?,"tl;dr: The wall is only an idea with lots of blanks. People on different sides of the divide fill in the blanks differently, so they end up with different conclusions. The Wall is just an abstract concept. A concrete project to build The Wall, a plan for how it would look, an estimate what it would cost, where exactly it would be located, or a clear objective that it would achieve, is not part of the discussion. And it gets worse: The problem The Wall is supposed to solve has not been clearly and fully defined. At this point in time, none of the involved politicians have enumerated the actual real life problems The Wall is supposed to solve, let alone explained how The Wall does so better than alternative options. So how come people on different sides fill in the blanks differently? There are plenty of strong assertions around the weakly defined The Wall project. These assertions usually carry along plenty of untrue implied statements. Let's give an example: OP's words ""Many countries around the world have a hard border with a physical barrier in place to stop illegal crossing/smuggling"" imply OP's words are true - if we assume ""many"" to mean ""more than 2"" - but all 3 implied statements are clearly false.* The comments provide anecdotal evidence that despite being obviously false, people do fall for these implied claims. While there are untrue or unproven implicit statements in circulation on both sides, I chose these particular claims because they are part of the original question I'm answering, and because they seem to be popular enough that I subjectively classify them as notable. The divide over the idea of The Wall is magnified due to the unfortunate fact that in the US there is a very peculiar situation where one of the major news networks specializes in the deliberate spread of false and misleading information.   All in all, The Wall is an abstract concept that promises a simple solution to an oversimplified problem, and the question of how 'The Wall' would solve real world problems hasn't been answered yet.  *Disclaimer: The below shows, on request, why the 3 implied falsehoods are such. It is not strictly relevant to, or part of, this answer, but it will satisfy some people's curiosity. 1) Continuous walls between countries are perfectly normal - false Only a tiny fraction of worldwide borders have walls, while the overwhelming majority or borders do not have man made barriers. If you follow the link, you'll notice that even among the small fraction of borders that have man made barriers, the majority of these are related to past, present, and/or probable future armed conflict, such as Ukraine-Russia, Korea-Korea, Saudi Arabia-Jemen, India-Pakistan, Syria-Turkey, etc.  2) Trump's wall can and will stop or significantly reduce smuggling - false A majority of drugs cross the US-Mexican border through ports of entry, therefore a new wall is entirely unable to affect a majority of smuggling. In addition, smugglers already use methods that do physically defeat current walls and will also defeat any new wall (catapults, planes/drones, tunnels). 3) Trump's wall can and will stop or significantly reduce illegal immigration - false In the public discourse ""illegal immigrants"" (incorrectly) refers to 3 kinds of people**: Visa overstays (who make up 40%-60% of undocumented immigrants entering the US), asylum seekers, and people who try to cross the border undetected. Visa overstays are entirely unaffected by a wall. Asylum seekers can easily surrender themselves in any place where the wall has to move a few feet away from the border for physical reasons, without having to cross a wall. Asylum seekers can alternatively also surrender themselves at a border checkpoint. The last category - people who try to cross the border undetected - will be affected by a wall. These people already need tools/vehicles and often hire experienced guides to cross the border - a wall will force these guides to find ways to circumvent it (ladders, ropes, blankets). In addition to the above, the symbolism of The Wall plays strongly into a pre-existing political divide, as outlined in Michael Kay's answer."
What is the point of impeaching Trump?,"""What is accomplished"" depends on whether you look at impeachment as a process that is strictly evaluated on partisan political gain, or whether you view it under its intended framework - as a tool for a co-equal branch of government to rein in potential abuses by the Executive Branch. If the President has committed abuses of the powers of office, removing him upholds the oath of office and duty to the Constitution that every Congressional member swore when taking office.  It reins in, punishes and discourages future abuses of office. Whether that helps them or not in the next election should be secondary considerations for public servants who pretend to be statesmen/women. Sadly, it isn't, but that is how it is supposed to be, so questioning the value is to question the fundamental design of our democratic institution of divided, co-equal branches of government checking and balancing each other. At the very least, if you think the party leadership is only interested in selfish, short-term gain, then consider the backlash among the voters who want their government to serve them, if they sit back and do nothing in response to a growing pile of abuses, because ""it will help us win the next election.""  Voter enthusiasm for one's party is what drives turnout. If you are viewed as intentionally enabling the ""evildoers,"" you lose the ability to be seen as an alternative in the eyes of the voters - you're just a different aspect of the problem. It may be that Pelosi feels she has no choice but to act. Or, as pointed out in discussion at the original question, if there is the recognition of a major political component to the impeachment process, the delay could be the by-product of waiting until conditions were better for successful action - a critical mass of evidence combined with a critical mass of public sentiment. In which case the political calculation serves the higher ideals of duty to democratic principles. {thanks given to Andrew for laying a lot of this out}."
"Why is Greece's debt considered a problem but not US debt, which is much larger?","I know that the population of Greece is much less than in the U.S., however I do not think it matters to people ""lending"" money to the governments This is where you are mistaken. The lender is concerned with the ability of the borrower to pay back the debt. If I have an annual income of $100,000, then all else being equal I can borrow much more than if my income is $10,000. The relevant measure here is debt-to-GDP ratio; that is, the size of debt in relation to the national economy. The ""national economy"" encompasses all industry and other economic activity, including tourism. The values are 181.6% for Greece and 73.8% for the USA. Basically, the debt of Greece is about 2.5 times larger in relation to its economy. Investors also take into account the borrowing country's political stability, tax collection, spending commitments, and so on. (This is analagous to a mortgage lender considering employment history, outgoing expenses, and the like.) On all these counts, Greece is in a worse position than the USA, so it is even worse off than the headline figure would indicate. Finally, the USA's national debt is denominated in dollars. If needed, the Federal Reserve can issue as many new dollars as it likes, so the USA cannot fail to pay its debt (unless its government chooses to default). Greece does not have this advantage, because its debt is denominated in euros. "
"""Putin enters a bar and proclaims, 'Next round's on the house!'"" What's the point of this popular Russian joke?","This relates to the Russian government's controversial decision to declare that the majority of workers should not go to work in April due to the COVID-19 pandemic, while also mandating that these workers should still be paid by their employers. As this Reuters article puts it: “They say ‘pay the salaries’, but no one explains where you’re
  supposed to get the money from,” [the co-owner of several bars in Moscow] said. “It will kill the
  (restaurant and bar) sector. Many of them won’t survive.” Small and medium-sized businesses have voiced anger and warned of mass
  bankruptcies in petitions to the government, including one with more
  than 250,000 signatures, illustrating the headwinds Putin faces as he
  tries to counter the virus. Critics point to how other countries have offered to pay workers;
  Britain, for example, pays up to 80% of wages. They also note Russia’s
  huge gold and forex reserves, around $550 billion. So the relation to the joke is that Putin is declaring that the bar should give free beer to everyone at its own expense, rather than at Putin's expense, in the same way that the Russian government is declaring that wages should be paid to workers at the employer's expense, rather than at the Russian government's expense. This contrasts to government programs such as in Britain, where furloughed workers can have 80% of their wages paid by the government."
What is capitalism's answer to constant economic growth hitting the limit of the planet's finite resources?,"Why would capitalism have an answer? Your question presumes that economic systems should be fully planned out into perpetuity, but that's just a false premise. You might as well ask what democracy's answer to peak oil is, or what individualism's answer to FTL travel would be. All capitalism means is that people are able to earn money off of things that they own (private ownership of capital goods). It's not like it's something that a cabal of people got together, mapped out, and implemented from the top down. It's emergent behavior that was later described as capitalism."
Why is globalisation so disdained?,"There are critics of globalization both on the progressive and on the conservative side of the political spectrum. One of the most relevant progressive anti-globalization NGOs is the European Attac. The main concern from the left-wing perspective is not globalization in theory but rather the way it is currently being implemented in practice: with a focus on economic interests instead of social and environmental interests. The current approach to globalization allows large international corporations to form which can then use their dominant market position in an exploitive manner. Among their issues are things like: But there are also globalization critics among the conservative. Among the reasons why conservatives dislike globalization are: Anti-authoritarian reasons for people not to like globalization are  Fringe arguments which can not be attributed to any mainstream political direction:  Note: Many of the facts presented in these reasons are disputed by pro-globalization advocates. Politics StackExchange answers are about describing real world political opinions, not arguing which opinions are correct."
How can I respond to Whataboutism?,"Note: this is a pretty long answer; and the specific points regarding whataboutism are at the last section, so you may want to skip there first if that's all you care about. Ultimately, by not having a level-headed political discussion. OK, this wording was a bit ironic, but in reality, many observers note that people in general are not often moved by facts - especially when said facts contradict their core political beliefs (the cognitive psychology terms for that are ""selective bias""/""biased assimilation"" and even worse, ""Backfire effect"" when the views are strengthened). In short, human brains are built in by evolution to find arguments to disprove any facts provided that contradict one's deeply held core beliefs; political ones chiefly among them. The exact evolutionary psychology reasoning behind this is somewhat off-topic so I won't go into details. So be it, Jedi.... The four general approaches to convincing people I would recommend are: Overwhelming evidence. This was discussed on ""You are not so smart"" podcast covering Backfire effect, in essence, there's a threshold at which that cognitive system breaks a dam, so to speak, and starts incorporating conflicting facts. But one, or two, or three, facts, would not be enough. Use proper framing. According to Moral Foundations theory; conservatives and liberals are swayed not by different facts; but by different framing of the facts. E.g. to convince a conservative, you frame things in terms of loyalty and patriotism; to convince a liberal, in terms of ""fairness"". Don't use facts. Experts on persuasion generally state that facts are the weakest way to persuade someone. Emotions etc... are far more effective. If you don't believe experts on persuasion because they weren't persuasive enough, here's a fact for you: psychologists confirmed that finding. Stop using personal attacks, or things that seem like personal attacks. ""Donald Trump's racism"" - to anyone who voted for Trump for reasons other than being racist, this mainly sounds like you are accusing THEM of supporting racism. This sounds cathartic and profound among your circle of Trump opponents - but has absolutely the opposite effect when talking to a Trump voter. Well, it really depends on (1) what your goal is and (2) what your argument is. We'll cover goal-based discourse in the next section, but let's examine your arguments - make sure that they are both valid AND persuasive. For example, you used an example of ""Donald Trump racism"". First off, note the last bullet point in the last section. No matter whether you have a valid argument or not, take care to not frame it in a way that will appear to the other person as an attack on them, in the latter case they'll at best tune you out and at worst will be even more antagonistic to your point of view. Second, make sure you even have a valid argument. Have you done research outside your own political bubble to confirm that there's actually such a thing as ""Donald Trump racism"" (outside of a logical fallacy of ""some racists support Trump, therefore Trump must be racist"")? Third, make sure you're speaking the same language and you're not succumbing to ""Intentionality fallacy"". In this specific example, 90+% chances are that you as Trump opponent are using a modern progressive definition of ""racism"" (anything that doesn't explicitly promote welfare of specific minority races, usually in Marxist ""equality of outcome"" context); whereas your Trump supporting opponent likely uses the pre-postmodernist, formal definition of ""racism"" (viewing one race as better than another, and expressing negative attitudes based on that view). You might like to think that you own the discourse... which you don't if your goal is to convince someone else. Also, chances are, you are committing another fallacy, that of confusing negative attitude about things OTHER than race, that just happen to be correlated with race (Just because a large majority of illegal aliens in USA are Hispanic, accusing someone of being anti-Hispanic racist just because they oppose illegal immigration is at best, a logical fallacy they will ignore or point out; at worst, likely to cause them to oppose you even more due to first point). And finally, you need to first decide what is your goal? - and adjust your approach to the best way to achieving that goal. Is your goal to make someone not vote for Trump? Then you need to find out first WHY they want to vote for Trump. Chances are, they have far more important reasons to vote for someone than a single issue, no matter how important that one issue is to you personally. So you need to first listen to the person you're discussing with; and then argue on the points they care about. If they care about economy and jobs, start with ""Hillary's economic plan will bring more jobs than Trump's"". OK, you may be wrong about that but at least you're now discussing the point the other person actually cares about; and therefore is more likely to think deeper about; instead of automatically rebut as ""this is just an attack on my candidate whom I like because of jobs"". I go back to asking what your goal is. Is it to convince someone of specific point? Or to convince them to vote a different way? Or to do something specific? Or to simply acknowledge that you're right and they are wrong? Let's say you're theoretically right (Trump's immigration policies are awful despite being, for example, far far softer than, say Mexico's own immigration policies). If it's to convince them of a specific point (or to take specific action): Don't use partisan talking points. What does Trump's view on immigration have to do with convincing someone that allowing illegal aliens the path to citizenship is a good idea? (and yes, they likely view the issue EXACTLY the way I just framed it, not the way you framed it). So, don't argue with them about Trump, in the first place. Argue the merits of the policy - first, ask what THEIR reasons to think a specific way are; then try to convince them on the merits to your viewpoint, using the ideas earlier in my answer. How is this important in the context of whataboutism? Because when you argue policy; there's no reason, or way, to do a ""what about"" response. You: ""Border wall is bad, for reasons X, Y and Z"" Them: ""But Hillary Clinton supported border wall"" You: ""So, Hillary was wrong too. Again, border wall is bad, for reasons X, Y and Z"" If it's to convince them to vote a different way Then, explain how voting that way is bad for the person you're arguing with. As noted above, if they care about economy, arguing about Trump's real-or-made-up racism is not going to change their mind. How is this important in the context of whataboutism? Because if you argue about points they don't care about, the backfire effect will take place and they won't care to listen to your points. Whataboutism isn't the root cause of the issue here, it's just a randomly used somewhat effective tactic of rejecting your arguments - but only one of many possible tactics. Bonus round: not all uses of whataboutism are invalid One last point to make: as Alexander O'Mara noted, ""whataboutism"" is a colloquial term that basically seems to frequently descend into ""you're a hypocrite"" rebuttal. On one hand, that kind of rebuttal is often is symptomatic of ""Appeal to Hypocrisy"" logical fallacy. On the other hand, sometimes a sober self-examination would reveal that the argument being made may, indeed, at its core, be hypocritical; and as such, ""Appeal to Hypocrisy"" in that situation isn't really a fallacy at all, but indeed a fully logical rebuttal. To address that, check your hypocritical privilege. An example would be: You: Donald Trump isn't fit to be President because he behaved disrespectfully towards women, and cheated on his wives, and people who do so are unfit for Presidency. Opponent: So did an accused rapist and sexual harasser Bill Clinton. Have you voted for Bill Clinton, twice? Have you publicly castigated John Edwards or JFK? Then you clearly don't believe either of your own two arguments, and are just using them as a convenient excuse to attack Trump as opposed to a sincerely held belief. Why should I subscribe to your belief when even you don't hold it sincerely? Importantly here, the rebuttal is NOT ""your point is wrong"" (which indeed would be a H.fallacy). It is ""your point is irrelevant to the discussion, since it's not a sincerely held belief for either one of us""."
Why allow convicted criminals to vote?,"The most trite answer is a civil rights protection against the following algorithm: This is relatively hard to prevent through other constitutional means, since the law doesn't need to be exclusively or primarily politically targeted to have an effect."
What can an independent election observer in Russia do if they notice irregularities?,"I was an observer yesterday at a Yekaterinburg voting station. I had been trained at a local Alexey Navalny headquarters (video example of training), but was officially an observer from Grigory Yavlinsky. As an observer, I had the right to make suggestions to the Chairman of the Voting Station Committee. In case a suggestion is not considered, an observer has the right to file a complaint, which must be considered at a Committee meeting either immediately or as soon as possible on the day of voting. The meeting must result in a written decision. The complaint is prepared in two copies. One copy remains with the observer to serve as proof of complaint. The first copy, along with the written verdict produced by the Committee, is attached to the Voting Protocol - the final document that contains the results of voting. Of course a copy of the verdict is also given to the observer. If the observer does not agree with the Committee's decision they may use their attested copy to file a complaint with the superior Committee - the Territorial Voting Committee. In my case, this Committee was just 3 kilometers away. A representative of this Committee visited us at midday to make sure everything went smoothly. We (observers) had phone numbers of members of this Committee in case we had any problems. The observer may also launch a case in an administrative or criminal court. He or she may also make the complaint public. The observer has the right to make video records and take photos. These may serve to substantiate his complaints and claims, and decrease the perceived legitimacy of the election even if the observer's steps made through official channels (superior Committees, courts) failed to right the wrongs. I sent updates on voting turnout each half-hour to my Alexey Navalny headquarters using a Telegram chatbot, and consulted with their specialists using a couple of Telegram chats. At the end of voting, each observer gets a copy of the Voting Protocol with the final figures (turnout, votes given for each candidate, number of ballots used, number of ballots spoiled, etc.). The actual Protocol is sent to the superior Committee which decides whether the procedure was performed just so. It may decide to recount the votes - in this case it must call all the Station Committee members and observers, gather them again in a single room, and make them recount the ballots, for instance, and produce a new Protocol. In some more fraudulent nooks and crannies of the Russian Federation, observers sometimes discover that a second Committee meeting was called in their absence because the observers were allegedly ""out of reach"" by phone. The observer then may make noise in the media, showing that the second (observer-less) session produced a Protocol with figures that are more pleasant for the powers that be. From a legal standpoint, there are two main laws that the observer may use in arguments with Committee members, in courts etc: Federal Law 67 ""On basic guarantees"" (lays down the rules for elections and referendums) and the Federal Law ""On Presidential Election in the Russian Federation"". There are also other laws that may be used to defend your rights as an observer. According to amendments made in the legislation in 2016, an observer may not be removed from the voting station by Committee members. He or she may be removed only by a court decision. This makes it harder for corrupt Committee members to make up pretexts for getting rid of irksome observers. In real life, with Russia being an authoritarian state, there are ways to thwart an observer. However, Yekaterinburg is a big city (1.5m people) and is considered something of a democratic oasis (relatively speaking). We have an openly ""non-Putinist"" city mayor, for instance. So there was nothing outrageous at my station. I was mainly thwarted by my own legal illiteracy. I was barred from taking pictures of the Books of Voters (before the start of voting) because they contain personal information. I know that this particular case is moot: according to some laws, I could take pictures but not make them public. According to some administrative rules, I could not even take pictures of these books. The books did not look much tampered to me, although there were several signatures ""made by mistake"" and crossed out, so I did not force the issue. I read in a Telegram chat later that some other observer drove his Committee Chairman to a fit by insisting on taking pictures of the Books. Do they have any legal power to force the government to re-do the
elections or is their job purely to increase transparency for the
voters? An observer's actions may result in a manual recount of votes, and/or in some or all ballots cast at this particular station being deemed ""null and void"". I haven't heard of an entire election being re-run due to observer action. There must be some legal framework for this, I guess, but that would be an incredibly tough thing to achieve in Putin's Russia. Of course an observer has no direct power, all should be achieved through making as many records as possible and as many complaints as possible. The two ballot boxes at my voting station:  My copy of the Voting Protocol (click for a larger-size version):   P.S. The legal part of my answer is based largely on Observer's Guideline (Справочник Наблюдателя) published by Golos (""Voice/Vote""), an independent observer organization. I read it for a couple of days before the voting; and on Observer Wiki. The sources are in Russian."
What is the purpose of democracy?,"What is the purpose of democracy? It's more a philosophical question than a political question but let me try a brief answer: Based on the previous remarks we could re-frame the question a bit as: if democracy is ""the best political system"", what is it better than? I think that phrasing the question this way points to the answer: in the current context, democracy (as we know it) is just the ""least bad"" known political system. Sure it's full of imperfections, but any other known system would be even worse, so in this sense its ""purpose"" is just to be comparatively better than any alternative. It's also important to emphasize that democracy is an evolving concept. For instance the original US constitution is considered a democratic landmark, even though it allowed slavery and that would be unthinkable for a democracy nowadays. To some extent, democracy can be thought as a political system meant to deal with human imperfections, for example: Any known alternative to democracy relies on the assumption that a particular person (or group of persons) is somehow the ""perfect ruler"". In this perspective, democracy is arguably superior because it acknowledges that humans are imperfect and corruptible, and tries to structurally mitigate the issues. "
Why does the US keep announcing what they think Russia is going to do in Ukraine?,"I think that the motivation is mostly to make it very hard for any Russian narrative to gain traction in the international public opinion, including in Russia. From a political perspective, Russia needs a good reason to invade Ukraine, otherwise it will look as the clear aggressor to everybody. Without a casus belli, Russia would become a rogue state, lose its legitimacy on the international stage, and it would be very difficult for Putin's government to keep the support of the Russian population. This is why Russian state media have been accusing the Ukrainian government of genocide, and this is why the US are trying to counter this narrative by exposing its fabrication. Preemptively exposing the Russian disinformation strategy undermines the efforts of Russian propaganda. The Russian government needs to disseminate quickly and broadly some very shocking news which justifies the invasion. In general, even if the disinformation is debunked eventually, it's always too little too late. But this strategy is much less effective if the disinformation is ""defused"" in advance by the US and their allies, since the shock effect doesn't work and people are much more suspicious. The constant reminder by the US that Russia has its army ready to strike also contributes to this purpose, since it implies that any ""shocking event"" triggering the war probably did not happen now by chance."
Why is there no effective anti-gun lobby in the United States?,"There definitely are organizations that are counter. Brady is nearly as famous. The reason it's not as seemingly effective is due to the fact that - due to political structure of the United States - it is far more work to pass sweeping arms control legislation:  any efforts that are pro-2d-amendment automatically have the ""this is what Constitution says"" tailwinds, both political and legal; whereas any opposite efforts have the same exact head-winds. Additionally, most additional anti-2d-amendment measures require passing new legislation, whereas most opposing efforts require merely NOT passing it. Again, due to political structure of USA, it's easier to do the latter than the former on any topic (and becomes nearly insurmountable when Republicans control the Presidency thus requiring not just passing the legislation but also overcoming the veto). Having said that, I would also dispute the question's assertion that it's not effective. There's plenty of laws, especially on state level, with some states making it incredibly difficult to be armed (think CA, NY, IL, DC). It only seems like it's not very effective if your end game is full prohibition (and if your game is full freedom, vice versa, NRA seems like it's not very effective, for a change of perspective)."
Do other countries guarantee freedoms that the United States does not have?,"I'm limiting this answer to only freedom of something. That is, freedoms where the government or other powerful groups do not interfere, or are prohibited from interfering, with something a citizen does by themselves. I'm not dealing with from negative things, such as freedom from hunger, which is basically the same as a right to be fed. Further, this answer deals with what governments permit citizens to do; as such, said permission might allow individuals or companies to infringe upon people's freedom more broadly: for instance, if kidnapping is legal in a country, the populace has the freedom to kidnap, but the kidnappers are then able to restrict the freedom of movement of their victims unopposed.  And of course, just because people are free to do something, does not mean it's a good idea. In fact, some of these freedoms are things that I think definitely should be illegal, but they're freedoms nonetheless.   Speech. Although the US has more freedom of speech than many countries, fighting words are not protected. This is an unusual doctrine, which I don't believe is present in most nations, although it may be subsumed under other restrictions in some places. In addition, several US states have criminal defamation statutes for private individuals. It does not appear that this is the case in all nations. For instance, it appears that Romania repealed its criminal defamation statutes for individuals in 2014.  Prostitution. In the United States, it is illegal to exchange money for sex in all but one state. However, in a number of other countries, prostitution and other forms of sex work are legal under some or all circumstances.  Gambling is illegal in most states in the United States, with various exceptions involving Native American nations, rivers, which effectively make it possible to find legal gambling in many areas. However, in some countries, such as the United Kingdom, there are apparently fewer restrictions on casinos.  Abortion is restricted by many states in the United States. Case law around abortion seems to permit it to be heavily restricted  after the first trimester (about 12 weeks). This constrast to some other countries: for instance, abortion in Norway is legal up to 18 weeks.   Ages of consent. Ages of consent in the United State vary, being 16 minimum and 18 maximum, although there are often exemptions for couples close in age. As such, sex between a minor (under 18) and someone over the age of 18 is frequently illegal.  By contrast, in Europe most countries have an age of consent between 14 and 16.  Immigration and freedom of movement is an interesting case, since it doesn't always apply directly within the United States but between the United States and other countries. However, the US does not allow unrestricted immigration from even its neighboring countries, Canada and Mexico. Most people need a visa to stay indefinitely in the US. However, some countries have open borders with certain other countries. Particularly notable is the Norwegian territory of Svalbard, where foreign nationals can stay indefinitely. Discrimination is another example.  In the United States businesses, including housing providers, are often prohibited from discriminating on the basis of characteristics such as race, gender, or religion. However, in some countries, such as Israel, discrimination on some of these bases is permitted. Of course, the specifics of discrimination can easily involve restrictions on freedom: for instance, refusing to rent to someone restricts their freedom of movement and freedom to live where they choose (as private property in general does, but over and above this). Similarly, refusing service to someone doesn't always just entail personally not doing anything to help them, but frequently entails invoking these same private property laws to kick them out of a business (again a restriction on freedom of movement) or to prevent one's employees from giving them service, thus restricting the employees' freedom to serve who they like.  Voting. Various states in the US have voter ID laws, which prevent people without an ID from legally voting. Many other countries do not have this requirement. Further, people convicted of a felony are not permitted to vote in many US states. By contrast, in many other countries people convicted of crimes and even in prison may vote. "
"Is President Trump right that there was violence on ""both sides"" in Charlottesville?","Yes, there was violence perpetrated by both AntiFa and the White Supremacists. Ben Shapiro's show the day after properly highlights the violence on each side (specific parts showing violence will be referenced below). That there was violence on one side does not dismiss or excuse the violence on the other side. That there was violence on both sides does not excuse the domestic terrorism incident perpetrated via vehicular murder. Many are highlighting a difference in the magnitude of the violence that was perpetrated by both sides, as if to insinuate that because the member of one side committed vehicular murder, the severity of the violence by the other side is lessened. This establishes a logical fallacy. To start, consider the course of events without the pinnacle of violence: each side had actors that engaged in violent interactions with the other. There are demonstrable acts of mob tendencies from each side, where a mass of group B descended on an individual from group A. The crimes of each side are repugnant. Then an individual drove a car through a crowd of people that opposed him, drastically escalating the level of force being used. Yes, this was heinous. Yes, it should be thoroughly dismissed as a repugnant act that has no place in civilized discourse. However, it doesn't dismiss or lessen the preceding illegality. There was wrong on each side; this was just more wrong. This was a grievous example of domestic terrorism. As reported by Politico, the Virginia Governor and Charlottesville mayor were warned in advanced of the potential for violence at the protest, from both the white supremacists and the anarchists, representatives of the extreme of either side. The Aug. 9 report by the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis was done in coordination with local, state and federal authorities at the Virginia Fusion Center. It stated that white supremacists and anti-fascist “antifa” extremists had clashed twice before in Charlottesville, at a white nationalist rally on May 13 and a Ku Klux Klan gathering July 7. At each event, “anarchist extremists” attacked protesters who had been issued permits, leading to fights, injuries, arrests and at least two felony charges of assault and battery.  In the possibility that there is an implication from Trump's statements that the violence from either side is equivocal, it is important to fully establish the context in which the violence took place. This includes describing the nature of the violence, estimating the quantity of the violence, and considering the possibility that some of the violence was performed in self defense. Prior to the in depth analysis, focus on the Charlottesville Police Chief, who openly stated in press conference following the violence that the different groups were ""mutually combative."" This will be everything but the murder, covered above. The event was scheduled to start at noon, but had to be canceled at 11.30 am due to the swelling level of violence.  The Unite the Right rally was scheduled to start at noon but it never happened. By 11:30 a.m., with demonstrators and counter-protesters fighting in the streets, Charlottesville and Albemarle County officials declared a state of emergency and later declared the rally an illegal assembly, slowly clearing the park Members of each side in this conflict open carried firearms at this protest (A legal activity in Virginia), depicted by these self proclaimed AntiFa or these Militia Men wearing shirts with Confederate Flags. Thankfully, Governor McCaulif stated in a NPR interview that no shots were fired during the event, though there are contradictory claims. Skirmish weapons were also on hand, as reported by the Daily Progress (pay wall), and referenced by the New York Mag:   “It could have been a lot worse today,” said Charlottesville Police Chief Al Thomas. “The premeditated violence is deplorable.” Both sides came prepared for violence, wearing protective helmets, masks and carrying flags. When violence broke out, many of the flags were stripped from the wood handles and the handles were used as clubs. Both sides brought street medics equipped with bandages and fluids for flushing eyes and skin afflicted with pepper spray.   This can be seen here, where the Alt-Right is marching with shields, helmets, and flags; in response, a fight breaks out between Antifa and the front line. Regrettably, who threw the first punch is obscured by the crowd. At another point, the Alt-right regroup, and are commanded back into action, shields and clubs used to batter the crowd. One of the counter protestors, Jacob L. Smith, punched a Reporter Taylor Lorenz from The Hill for taping the events.  A New York Times Reporter, Sheryl Gay Stolberg, tweeted:   The hard left seemed as hate-filled as alt-right. I saw club-wielding ""antifa"" beating white nationalists being led out of the park 2/2   This lasted up until the backlash that she was ""creating an equivalency."" African American individual utilized an improvised flamethrower against a large group of Alt-Right. His story, presented by the Independent, sets the premise that he had attended the protest to heckle the Alt-Right, including claims that a gun was held to his head and a shot was fired at his feet. At a later point during the event, he was involved in an altercation where he used a spray can he found on the ground and a lighter in his pocket to hold off the crowd. This order of events (brandished firearm, discharged firearm, lunging with flag, and employment of improvised flame thrower), are disproved by a video released by the ACLU of Virginia. In this video, the order of events are depicted as: The current dead - injured - missing values for the event are 3 - more than 36 - 0, as reported by Charlottesville Officials. This includes the tragic helicopter crash (2-0-0), the injuries from the vehicular murder (1-19-0), and individual altercations (0-more than 17-0). This does not account for people that were injured during individual altercations but did not seek medical aid, or associate their request for medical aid with the incident. Regrettably, there isn't a fullness of understanding for that total number of violent altercations. It is possible that some of the violence that occurred during this protest was purely self defense. Virginia defines self defense, from charges of Assault or Battery, via common law and court decisions, as: Committing a battery with legal justification: hitting, pushing, scratching, etc. a person who placed you in “reasonable fear” of “imminent danger of bodily harm,” where your actions were “reasonably necessary to protect” yourself. An act that began as self-defense can cross the line into a separate crime of battery if you use excessive or unreasonable force in defending yourself.   From the same link, when considering that the police chief said many altercations between both groups were ""mutually combative,"" all of those participants are wrong doers as described by SCOTUS case Rowe V. United States.  If an individual was to claim Self Defense as an affirmative defense to charges, it is important that you either didn't instigate the altercation (fighting words, overt threats, etc.) or that you've made a good faith effort to abandon the fight. From the Patriot Act, as understood by the ACLU, our definition is:   A person engages in domestic terrorism if they do an act ""dangerous to human life"" that is a violation of the criminal laws of a state or the United States, if the act appears to be intended to:  (i) intimidate or coerce a civilian population; (ii) influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or (iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination or kidnapping.  Additionally, the acts have to occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States and if they do not, may be regarded as international terrorism.   Driving a car through a crowd of people that were offering a counter protest to your activities fits this definition. Though it should be noted that the violence as speech from both sides, which lead to the Police force terminating the Unite the Right protest and calling for the groups to disperse, could also fit within this definition. Consider reporting from Politico detailing their activities as ""domestic terror violence."" This is not a media term; it is the legal definition by which the events of Charlottesville should be judged. All sides aren't violent in a riot; Simplistically there were two sides at this fight, but that doesn't account for the idiots or peaceful folk that joined into the fight with out intentions to resort to violence. this allows for the possibility that: There were leftist protest who were intent on peaceably protesting the Alt-Right Antics. There were some misguided idiots from the right who were there for ""free speech"" reasons. Note: In today's climate, look who is standing next to you. If you're beside people that embrace white power, you're going to be associated with nazis. In the context of this answer, the Nazis are the violent extremes of the Unite the Right Protest. This includes those chanting Hail Victory, performing the colloquially recognized Nazi Salute, or openly displaying White Supremacy symbolism (white pride flags). This answer rejects the implication that all of the right are Nazis."
Why do some people take issue with kneeling during the anthem in US?,"The answer to ""what is wrong with kneeling"" is symbolism. And more specifically, the question shouldn't be ""what is wrong with kneeling"" but instead ""why do many people see it as wrong""; since there's no objective metrics of what's right or wrong, and the answer may very largely depend on one's ideological postulates.  So, let's answer that second question - why do many people consider it wrong. First off, I'd like to clarify something which seems to confuse the question poster. It's not the ""kneeling"" as a physical act itself that is perceived as being wrong.  It's more of ""doing anything that is protesting the anthem"".  Kneeling is merely a stand-in for ""something OTHER than standard etiquette of standing with hand on heart"" - and yes, I'm fully aware of the irony of ""land of the free"" imposing a unified unyielding standard of expressing patriotism. As such, such a normally-respectful gesture as kneeling (which originated in feudal knights showing respect to their liege), becomes an insult - wholly because of intent, not the form. (It's also worth noting that at this point some players decided to protest in far less respectful ways, including stretching for the game during the anthem, or deliberately not showing up on the field). Now, as to why it's perceived as insult: It's generally[1] considered that showing respect to one's country's national symbols (specifically, flag and anthem) is a show of respect for the country in general, as well as to people in the armed forces who risk their lives to protect the country. And conversely, it's seen that showing disrespect to a country's symbols is disrespecting the country (and, by extension, its citizens). At its root, this is why so many people (~50%) are utterly opposed to, for example, flag burning, despite the fact that there's a clear First Amendment point that flag burning is perfectly fine, being a form of political expression. [1] - Before people start spouting about ""evil capitalism"" and ""white pride"" and ""evil Amerikkka"" (because Trump is somehow involved), it's worth noting that the concept is NOT uniquely American, and exists in, for example, India, Mexico, and Jamaica, (random Google picks) in pretty much the same form. It also existed in former USSR and probably in the modern Russian federation. I'd be surprised if it does not exist in some form in most countries. As such, regardless for what motivated the NFL protests, a lot of people in US see taking the knee during the anthem as an explicit deliberate insult to the country. Some people consider that ""wrong"", regardless of what the protest is about. In one poll, which was conducted by Reuters, 72 percent of Americans said that they thought Kaepernick's behavior was unpatriotic. Another 61 percent said that they do not ""support the stance Colin Kaepernick is taking and his decision not to stand during the national anthem."" all American adults disapprove 54 - 38 percent of athletes refusing to stand during the National Anthem in protest of perceived police violence against the black community, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released today.  An extra special dose of insult comes from the fact that many people associate American Football with patriotism and the country, symbolically. I suspect the emotional effect would have been far less if it all happened at a real (Soccer) Football game. Interestingly, there does seem to be some actual blowback to the NFL because of this as per polling: “Are football fans voting with their TVs?” asks a new Rasmussen Reports survey. “As the NFL struggles to explain this season’s downturn in viewer ratings, 34 percent of American adults say they are less likely to watch an NFL game because of the growing number of protests by players on the field,” the poll reports, noting that 12 percent say they are more likely to watch, while half say the protests have no effect on their viewing decisions. P.S. As an additional, secondary issue, some people take umbrage at the idea that NFL players—whose multi-million dollar salaries are enabled both by the institutions of the USA and by millions of fans who are offended by the kneeling—are protesting ""injustices"". It's a lot easier to accept the protest from random Joe Schmoe rather than a multi-millionaire success story, regardless of what the protest is about (this is similar to how people earning $40K react to ""sexism affects unequal salaries in Hollywood"" protests from actresses being paid millions of dollars—it doesn't matter if they actually are paid less than male actors, or what the reasons are, it still seems utterly hypocritical to many average persons."
"Why was Trump winning the 2016 election, when I know so few people who admit to voting for him?","This is a great question, but it's really impossible to answer for certain at this point in time.  Trump's current success is defying a lot of ""conventional wisdom"" about how primaries go.   That said, the odds are good that your reason #2 is the most likely: ""Donald Trump supporters fall under a category of people with whom I have little contact, at least of the type that would be likely to talk politics."" This article from FiveThirtyEight, while it dates from December (well before any actual votes) still seems accurate when it says: The latest polls of the Republican presidential primary show a party badly divided by education: Donald Trump’s strong showings are entirely attributable to huge leads among voters without a college degree, while voters with a degree are split among several candidates. It then goes on to draw a parallel to last election cycle: A similar diploma divide was starkly evident in 2012, when college-educated Republicans almost single-handedly propelled Mitt Romney to the nomination. Romney’s two chief rivals, Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich, combined to win 765,329 more primary votes than Romney before they exited the race in April, thanks to their dominance among voters without college degrees. But those non-college-educated GOP voters split fairly evenly between Santorum and Gingrich, allowing Romney to prevail with a plurality of votes. Part of what Trump has going for him this election cycle appears to be motivating the non-college-educated-but-conservative segment of the population to turn out and vote in higher numbers than usual.  All four Republican contests so far have had greater turnout than in 2012, including Nevada where Trump got more votes this year than there were votes cast in 2012.  If Trump supporters are people who generally have not been involved in primaries or politics in the past, then you and your politically-aware circles would have very little overlap with them. Additionally, since that demographic is showing up specifically to vote for Trump, then the division of the more politically active segments between the rest of the field leaves an opening for a plurality candidate who can never reach a majority.  One theory says that Trump has a ""ceiling"" of somewhere around 35% support (+/- 5%).  35% is a lot in a race where the other 65% is split 22/22/8/8/5, but it's nowhere near enough in a race where the other 65% is united.  Even if it were 45%/55% after consolidation, Trump wouldn't be winning. All that can probably be summed up by saying:"
Why are the Taliban winning against the Afghan army?,"Corruption is rampant in Afghanistan, including in the military.  They routinely take bribes and sell military equipment to the Taliban.  Basically, the average ANA soldier is there just to collect a paycheck, either legally or illegally.  Combine that with the US withdrawal, and the fact that the Taliban is not being anywhere near as brutal as expected, and it should be obvious why the country is falling so fast. The average ANA soldier knows the ANA is corrupt, they won't have his back should he stand and fight.  He also knows the only force who would help him, the US military, is leaving.  Last, he knows the Taliban aren't doing mass executions of surrendering ANA troops.  So why wouldn't he sell them his gear and surrender?  And every ANA soldier who comes to this conclusion reinforces the first point for the next ANA soldier contemplating surrender.  There is a momentum aspect to defeat, once it gets going it's hard to stop.  Imagine you're an ANA soldier, and you hear about a whole ANA army corps surrendering.  How good are you going to feel about your job?"
Could Ecuador get Julian Assange out of the UK by giving him some mail to deliver?,"From the pre-amble to the convention: Realizing that the purpose of such privileges and immunities is not to benefit individuals but to
  ensure the efficient performance of the functions of diplomatic missions as representing States, The purpose of allowing a country to nominate a courier to carry mail is to allow for the delivery of mail from a mission without it being intercepted by the host country. The purpose is not to use it as a loophole to prevent the arrest of an individual or get around the provisions of Article 9. The Treaty needs to be read as a whole, and not picked apart. As for what would happen, that would be speculation. Most likely he would arrested. He would then wait in jail for a judge to decide his fate with reference to the 1964 act which incorportated the Vienna conventions into English Law, and the existing charge of jumping bail."
"Why does ISIS continue to do things to make their ""enemy"" even more determined to go after them?","The stated goal of ISIS is to eliminate ""the grey area"". Today there is a sizeable minority of Muslims living in western society. ISIS wants to show that it's not possible for Muslims to live in the western world. Their method is to perform terrorist attacks in the hope it will cause a backlash against Muslims living in the western world. ISIS states this very clearly: “the time had come for another event to … bring division to the world and destroy the grey zone” and: “the world today is divided into two camps”: that of kufr, or unbelief, and that of their own warped interpretation of Islam. In between these lies the “grey zone”, inhabited by those who call themselves Muslims yet fail to join Daesh.”"
Why is Elizabeth Warren's Native American ancestry a political issue?,"What point was she trying to make when she claimed Native American heritage? There's a few things to consider here Native Americans are a pretty well defined minority group, complete with an actual culture. Warren either sold herself, or heavily implied, that she was a minority, despite the fact that she was clearly not a member of that minority. She has never done anything culturally with Native Americans, nor did her parents live as Native Americans. Warren has been inconsistent on why she did it and how much she knew. In 2012, while running for Senate, she said she did it to ""find people like her"". She was listed as a minority for most of her Harvard tenure US Senate candidate Elizabeth Warren said on Wednesday that she listed herself as a minority in directories of law professors in the hopes of networking with other “people like me” — meaning those with Native American roots.
  Asked whether she considers herself to be a minority, the Democrat said, “Native American is part of my family. It’s an important part of my heritage.”  Last week, Warren said she had no idea that Harvard was touting her as a minority in the 1990s. But two days later, she acknowledged that for years before she joined the faculty at Harvard, she had been classifying herself as a minority professor in a directory of the Association of American Law Schools. 
  That directory included Warren on a list of minority professors from 1986 through 1995.  She then claimed ""high cheekbones"" as proof of her claim ""I have lived in a family that has talked about Native Americans, talked about tribes since I had been a little girl,"" she said. ""I still have a picture on my mantel and it is a picture my mother had before that - a picture of my grandfather. And my Aunt Bea has walked by that picture at least a 1,000 times remarked that he - her father, my Papaw -- had high cheek bones like all of the Indians do. Because that is how she saw it and your mother got those same great cheek bones and I didn't. She that thought was the bad deal she had gotten in life.""  More recently she has claimed that her parents had to elope because her mother was ""too Cherokee"" (a claim that seems less likely in light of the distant relationship from her test) My mom and dad were very much in love and they wanted to get married. And my father’s parents said, ‘Absolutely not, you can’t marry her, because she’s part Cherokee and part Delaware.’ After fighting it as long as they could, my parents went off, and they eloped. It was an issue in our family the whole time I grew up about these two families. It was an issue still raised at my mother’s funeral. Warren submitted several recipes for a cookbook entitled ""Pow Wow Chow"" that appear to have been plagiarized, and from non-Native American sources The 1984 cookbook Pow Wow Chow was edited by Mrs Warren's cousin Candy Rowsey and is billed as a collection of recipes from the Five Civilized Tribes. But it appears that at least three of the five recipes featured in the book were fakes, according to an investigation by Mr Carr. Harvard touted Warren as a minority professor as a way to blunt criticism that the faculty was not diverse (emphasis mine) ""The fact that there never have been Asian Americans, Native Americans, gays, lesbians, Latinos, Latinas and women of color [on the faculty] is a subject of major concern,"" said Wilkins, who is black. Although the conventional wisdom among students and faculty is that the Law School faculty includes no minority women, Chmura said Professor of Law Elizabeth Warren is Native American. Warren identified herself as Native American on a Texas State Bar card  Why does any of this matter? The problem, ultimately, is that Warren clearly derived some social benefit from the claims she made. Warren is basically a white woman, but by claiming to be a minority woman she could raise her social standing among her peers by being touted as some sort of ceiling breaker (i.e. being viewed as a a Harvard version of Rosa Parks), instead of a woman with white privilege.  While the test does indicate that she indeed has a Native American ancestor, the test does not make her a part of any Native American tribe, which is what the box is meant to indicate. It raises questions about Warren's credibility. Consider that she may be facing off, in the Democratic primaries, against Corey Booker and/or Kamala Harris in 2020 (both are black). It's easy to assume they would want to question her about being labeled a ""woman of color""."
What is the capitalist answer to rail passenger transportation being non financially profitable?,"Japan is a counter-example. Rail is profitable there, not least because the rail companies don't just run the trains. Train stations become hubs, often with a shopping centre built around them (owned by or in partnership with the train company), even parts of new towns. All this extra revenue helps keep the transport side profitable, and helps justify a high level of service by viewing it as a feed for the other profit sources."
Why is the British government so determined to arrest Julian Assange?,"The UK government is not above the law. UK law requires the government to pursue fugitives. There is no tradition in the UK of allowing fugitives to go free if they are able to remain free for a long enough time. Instead, there is a tradition of the rule of Law, and the expectation that the government will act to uphold the Law. The case is exceptional because Ecuador has chosen to offer sanctuary in its embassy. It is unusual for the UK police to be unable to arrest someone whose location is well known."
Do politicians use bug trackers or version control etc.?,"Politicians, that is to say, the people that we elect, do not actually do the work of the government.  Their primary job is raising funds and encouraging people to vote for them.  Legislation is mostly written by their staff.   If a politician participates in writing legislation, it's not as a developer submitting changes to legislative review.  It's as a manager, writing out a few lines of direction that do not work as actual law.  The actual developers (staff) are then expected to fix that.   I doubt that most legislation writers use the same version control as is used for software.  Unlike software, legislation is written in normal language.  It has one hard line break per paragraph rather than one per statement.  They are far more likely to use the revision control built into something like Microsoft Word.  That is less about collaboration with a central source and more about seeing who made what changes when.  It's also more consistent with how they've done it historically.   Programming benefits from having everyone involved familiar with computers.  It's natural that it's on the cutting edge.  Even with that, Git only dates to 2005 and Subversion to 2000 (source:  Wikipedia).  Older systems like SCCS and RCS only worked with changes by line, which as previously noted would have ended up being paragraphs in legislation.   Note that staff works full time on whatever legislation.  They operate in small collaborative groups that actually can meet with each other to write legislation.  In particular, in the United States, committees have their own staff that are true subject matter experts.  You mention Europe, which may operate differently.  But I suspect that it doesn't.   Legislation written in public in version control would be a great idea for transparency.  Unfortunately, most politicians are more interested in getting reelected than transparency.  You can see this in California (US), where there is a system allowing law changes by public referendum.  Politicians are endlessly, albeit privately, complaining about how these make their jobs more difficult.  So any progress towards transparency tends to be made in fits and starts by newer legislators.  "
"If ""more guns less crime"", how do gun advocates explain that the EU has less crime than the US?","They don't. While there are a lot of half-assed arguments (on both sides, to be fair), any serious statistical analysis that actually controls for variables comes down on the side of gun control. A good example of this is a recent meta-analysis of 130 studies from 10 countries which found: Evidence from 130 studies in 10 countries suggests that in certain nations the simultaneous implementation of laws targeting multiple firearms restrictions is associated with reductions in firearm deaths. (""What Do We Know About the Association Between Firearm Legislation and Firearm-Related Injuries?"" - link in the article above) There are two big factors that skew the statistics, and any discussion of the subject that doesn't mention them is dishonest, IMHO. That means most of them, from both sides ot the issue. First, gun ownership and gun legislation differs vastly between rural and city regions. Crime is higher in cities - that is true everywhere in the world. And gun ownership is lower, because you don't need a gun to protect your cows from coyotes if you live in a flat on the 20th floor. As a result, if you don't consider this fact, you can find statistics that show higher gun ownership rates equal lower crime rates. Second, a large percentage of gun-related crime in the cities is amongst gangs. This is even more so when you look at homicides. Some police officer once said that the unspoken truth about gun violence is that it's mostly young black men killing other young black men. If you don't consider this fact, you can find statistics that show gun-related death rates rivalling some war zones in American cities. So, as with most political arguments, you can twist facts to serve your purpose. But most of the anti-gun-control rhetorics doesn't go so far. It works along a different path: by repeating things again and again, you can make them appear true. That's a simple exploitation of human psychology. Our brain is hardwired to accept things that we hear many times as true."
Why do Indian reservations still exist in North America?,"To remove such rights would be unfair. But while the reservations have a particular context, self-determination for ethnic minorities is not so unusual. The Native American and First Nation peoples were moved to reservations as a deliberate policy of ""ethnic cleansing"" in the 19th century.  The various tribes were given limited rights to self-governance on their new reservations. Now if we propose to remove those rights, justice would expect that the lands that were taken should be returned. However this is not a practical idea: the original inhabitants are long dead, the land has been dramatically changed and there are several hundred million new people living on those lands. The Indian nations currently living on reservations want to preserve such rights as they have. There is, of course, no legal barrier to leaving a reservation, and many people of Native American and First Nation descent don't live on reservations. As such, removing such limited rights that the Native American nations have to self-determination without giving something in return would be an extension of a historical injustice. By way of analogy: A school bully steals a fountain pen worth $20 from another boy. Laughing at the boy the bully gives the boy $1 and says ""It's not stealing, I'm buying the pen"". 20 years later, and both the bully and the boy have grown up. The bully says ""It was wrong of me to steal your pen and give you a dollar in exchange. So I'm going to take back the dollar."" The idea of certain peoples having limited self-determination is not so unusual. The Welsh (who were perhaps victims of an earlier ethnic cleaning by the invading Saxons) have an assembly and the Scots have a parliament. Other regions in Europe have similar arrangements. It is quite common for an ethnic minority that is geographically limited to be granted some form of limited self-determination."
"You have the right to remain silent, but why?","As with many such rights, you should look to pre-modern Europe to understand the context in which such rights were introduced. At that time, without forensic evidence, the best chance of a conviction was a confession, and easiest way to get a confession would be to mistreat a prisoner. There was no police force so magistrates and judges would be greatly involved in the interrogation of suspects. A judge could interpret a suspect's behaviour during the interview in any way he wished. If the judge was prejudiced against the suspect, this would lead to miscarriages of justice. The fifth amendment of the US Constitution should be seen particularly in the context of the Star Chamber, which was a court in the UK. It was used to prosecute dissenters and Puritans. Those brought before the court were compelled to swear an oath, and if their answers were unsatisfactory (i.e. not matching the King's expectation) they would be convicted of perjury. Failing to answer would be a contempt of court. In the modern context, the question becomes, ""why maintain the right to silence"". In modern jurisdictions, it has become clear that confessions are unreliable, and so modern jurisprudence depends much more on forensic evidence. Removing the right to silence would put pressure on more innocent people to give a false confession.  All this is bad justice. It's unfair to the suspect, and so it is unfair to the victim."
Is there a way to block an elected President from entering office?,"As of today (November 9th), the United States have not yet elected a president. They have elected an electoral college, which will elect a president on December 19th. Theoretically the electors could still change their mind and elect someone completely different. It is not unheard of that individual ""faithless electors"" vote different than mandated by the result in their state for whatever reason. In 21 states this is completely legal, and in many others the repercussions are minor. However you should not bet on this. Never in the history of the United States did enough electors do this to make someone else president than they should have. In 1836, 23 faithless electors for Virginia were almost successful  when it came to electing the vice president. But that was the closest faithless electors ever came to changing an election outcome. Another reason to protest against Trump now is to undermine his authority as president to convince Congress and Senate members to support him less in the upcoming years. A president can't do much without backing from Congress and the Senate. When a president suggests acts which are amazingly unpopular, party loyality might not be enough to prevent them from blocking them. So sending the message ""We hate the president and when you let him do what he wants we will hate you too!"" could have an influence."
What does it actually mean for the Republicans to have lost the House of Representatives?,"The majority party in the House of Representatives gets to appoint the Chairman of every sub-committee in the House, there are many of these. These chairmen are all Republicans, but will soon all be Democrats, every one of them. The ruling party needs no excuse to replace them, and all chairmen are always appointed from the ruling party. Each of these Chairmen has the authority to issue subpoenas (these are legal documents that can require the recipient to testify, to turn over records (like emails), and so on, refusing to do so is a crime that may result in being jailed for Contempt of Congress). It is the job of both the House and Senate, independently if they like, to oversee government operations, conduct inquiries, get testimony under oath (lying under oath is perjury, a felony that can be punished by five years in prison). YES, the House has the authority to demand from the IRS the Tax Returns of Donald Trump, pursuant to any number of investigations they might undertake to see if he is taking emoluments (payments from foreign countries) or profiting from his office or making decisions to benefit his own business, family, etc. The House does not need ANY excuse or evidence or permission to start such an investigation: They are in charge of oversight. Further, the House chairmen are free to re-open any investigation their predecessors have put aside. So they can re-open investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, or 2018 election. During this investigation, the Democrats requested something like 64 subpoenas of records and testimony; the Republicans denied every single request. Well, every single one of those subpoenas will now be issued, the witnesses heard under oath before a Democratic Chair, and that includes Trump's children, friends, business records, business employees, tax returns, etc. Unlike the Republicans that excused blatant lying by some of these witnesses and allowed some (like Trump's son) to simply refuse to answer, a Democratic Chair can compel testimony under penalty of Contempt. Further, for most of this testimony, it can be public if they wish, or be behind closed doors but all or some of the testimony revealed to the public. That is also within the purview of the Chair (with exceptions for some classified material). Although the House cannot unilaterally pass any law (they can introduce one, but both the House and Senate must approve and the President must sign; or if he vetoes, be overruled by 2/3 of both). But this power of investigation into corruption, self-dealing, foreign influence, and so on is actually a very big deal, and the results of the investigation can result in criminal charges. The House cannot be restrained or gagged by either the President or Senate, it is subordinate to neither one. Finally, only the House, after investigation, can bring impeachment charges against the President (actually they can impeach any executive or judicial branch federal government employee; including judges and Supreme Court justices). These charges must then be heard by the Senate, which may vote to remove the offender from office. It is unlikely they will, especially with a Senate friendly to the President, but you never know what they might uncover that would change the minds of at least some Republican Senators. So yes, there is a remote chance that even a ""New President"" is the result.  P.S. Also, all spending bills raising revenue must originate in the House; including laws raising or lowering taxes (the Supreme Court has held). Neither the Senate or the President have the right to raise or lower taxes. P.P.S: All laws must be passed by both the House and Senate, by a majority in each. Typically the President must also sign a new law, but if the President Vetoes, then a 2/3 majority of each Chamber (House and Senate) can override a Presidential Veto and pass the law anyway. So Democrats can now block any NEW law. This also means they can prevent the repeal of any law, since repeal is treated the same as new law. So they will likely not allow any changes to the social safety net; Medicare, Medicaid, Obamacare, Social Security, etc. There has been talk of re-allowing health insurance companies to refuse to sell insurance to or to charge more to people with pre-existing conditions (e.g. a person has asthma, so they can be denied insurance even against unrelated diseases like cancer or tuberculosis). The House won't allow any such repeal or new law to pass. Also, since the House can veto a budget or other allocation of funds to build the Wall against immigrants spanning the border with Mexico, they can ensure that doesn't happen. "
What ethical (if any) or economical arguments are offered in defense of the inheritance tax?,"What arguments are typically offered by those supportive of this
taxation technique, both ethically and economically, in order to
defend and promote its use? Inheritance taxes aren't taxes on dead people who paid taxes on what they earned during life. The dead people are dead. They suffer no harm and receive no benefit from what happens to their wealth after their deaths. An inheritance tax, even when structured as an estate tax, is fundamentally a tax on people who receive inherited wealth upon which they have paid no taxes. As a general rule, we tax increases in wealth that result from transfers of money and property. At a very basic level, a bonus to an employee of $1,000,000, winning $1,000,000 in the lottery, receiving a gift of $1,000,000 and receiving an inheritance of $1,000,000 are all events with the same economic effect on the recipient and fit within a broad definition of income. But, in most countries, gifts and inheritances are exempt from taxation as income and a gift or inheritance or estate tax is a tax in lieu of an income tax that is designed to impose less of an administrative burden than treating gifts and inheritances as income would. Generally speaking, we tax individuals as individuals, not as corporate family units. Not subjecting gifts and inheritances to income taxation is the exception to the general rule, not imposing taxes on large gifts and inheritances. Thus, an inheritance tax can be seen as a way of broadening the income tax base, particularly if those taxes would be comparable in magnitude for similar amounts of property transferred. In this view, an inheritance tax supports the standard economic maxim that if you want to raise a certain sum of money, and you have to use distortive taxation, it is best (in terms of efficiency) to use all margins, i.e. to distort everywhere a little instead of only somewhere a lot. Expanding the tax base to include taxation of inheritances, could allow income tax marginal rates to be somewhat lower, and improve efficiency. Recall also that income and inheritance taxation are fundamentally, in principle, justified as you are paying for the benefits you receive from the government's efforts to create a system of laws and a regulated society. Income and inheritance taxes are ethical to impose because they are paying the taxpayer's fair share of benefit received from living in that society which is orderly/safe enough that you were able to give/gain that wealth by means of income or inheritance at all. Indeed, ethically, there is less justification for taxing earned income, for which the recipient had to give up something of value in time and effort in order to get paid, than there is for taxing a lottery winner, gift recipient, or inheritance recipient who gave up little or nothing to earn the money received and did absolutely nothing of substance to deserve this wealth. Why not tax undeserved money? Put another way, inherited wealth creates a leisure class that we do not need and who are mere parasites on society that don't have to contribute anything to it. Of course, sometimes people who inherit wealth do develop noblesse oblige or utilize their leisure to make long term progress for society in science and culture that people forced to think about providing for themselves economically, which is pretty much everyone who does not inherit great wealth, don't have the resources of time or money to do. This ethical consideration ties into an economic one. Someone who earns a lot of money can generally be trusted to be competent to manage and invest it well, but we have no similar assurances that the recipient of the property will be particularly qualified to manage it in the case of ""dumb money"" received by lottery or accident of birth. This doesn't mean that heirs to great fortunes die paupers. But, for example, if Donald Trump had simply invested his inherited wealth in an S&P 500 Index fund instead of actively managing it, he would be more wealthy than he is today. On the other hand, the children of wealthy people or objects of the bounty of wealthy people may be more qualified than the average person to manage that wealth, due perhaps to inherited aptitude, or perhaps because they have been groomed for that responsibility during life. But, this is undermined by the fact that most inherited wealth dissipates in subsequent generations, rather than building up. People who inherit wealth are more likely than people who accumulate wealth themselves to use it for self-indulgence or to lose it with bad investments. Great fortunes rarely last even three or four generations. Economics is all about incentives. The incentives created by an inheritance tax or its absence, are complex and lead to considerations that run both ways. One reason that we don't tax gifts and inheritances at a 100% rate is because the ability to pass on wealth to the next generation gives the people who are currently earning that wealth an incentive to create more wealth and because these very wealthy people would be less economically productive if they couldn't do so. But, the empirical account here is also mixed. First people earn money for their own comfort, but in the low tens of millions of dollar range and up, most people who earn great wealth struggle to spend it as fast as they earn it, because at that point many of the things that they purchase (e.g. real estate and art) don't get used up and decline in value after you buy them. Then, up to a point, people want to leave everything they own to their children. But, at some point, the vast majority of wealthy people (for whom I've worked as an estate planner for most of my adult life) start to think that enough is enough and no longer want to spoil their children (who are themselves typically past retirement age when they receive inheritances in this day and age). After that point (in reality this starts to kick in around the tens of millions of dollars mark), the very wealthy tend to be more concerned about leaving a legacy for the larger community in the form of university buildings and museums named after them, charitable foundations and other symbols of them having made a difference in the world, and those charitable gifts and inheritances are typically not taxed. It is certainly not the case empirically that even a 45% gift and inheritance tax rate significantly reduces economic productivity in people who give their wealth to family members. You really need to approach 60%-70% effective rates or so before you start to see much of a significant impact on productivity of donors, and that is only in cases where charitable legacies are not a primary concern. Normal decent people, even really rich ones, want to benefit both family and friends and a larger society. Normally, in the absence of a nudge from society, they err on the side of giving to family rather than society as their motivating goal to continue producing. But, inheritance taxes provide a nudge that helps the wealth shift their preferences modestly from a basically selfish motivation to a more community oriented motivation, by making charitable gifts and inheritances tax free, while taxing gifts and inheritances to family and friends. This makes inheritance taxes basically optional. You can give to society and not pay these taxes and have a choice over what cause in society you want to promote. This choice of which cause you want to promote still gives you an incentive to work productively in old age to advance that societal goal. And, the earners unlike their heirs, have shown themselves to be high in merit and so likely to make good and efficient choices about how to improve society with their estates. And, while the causes chosen by wealthy old people to advance may not exactly match societal needs, tax funds can fill the gaps that no one wealthy was interested in donating to at death, so it doesn't really matter all that much exactly what charitable legacies the rich leave, even though they and their heirs can feel good about the charitable legacies that they do leave. The flip side of the incentive that is provided for donors is that inheritance provides no incentive whatsoever for heirs to do anything but engage in self-indulgence that has no necessary benefit to the larger society. Huge amounts of resources that could have been used to create incentives are instead squandered away without receiving anything in return. Indeed, the empirical evidence clearly supports the conclusion that people who receive ""economic life support"" in the form of substantial gifts and inheritance become much less economically productive than comparable individuals who do not receive substantial gifts and inheritances. Most of the time, spending money boosts the economy more than sitting on it, and purchasing productive investments creates more value than purchasing unproductive investments. But, people who receive inherited wealth are much more likely to not spend and to not productively invest their inheritances, than the people who would have received that economic benefit had the money been taxed and distributed. So, untaxed inheritances are a drag on the economy. Inheritors of wealth buy paintings and fancy mansions, not backhoes and factories. They invest in prestige rather than infrastructure. Their spending reduces the economy's capacity to produce necessities in favor of its capacity to produce luxuries that most people can't afford at all. Historically, one of the important reasons to not only allow inheritances but to specifically favor inheritances to a single heir to an entire fortune was that gifts and inheritances were a major mechanism by which significant amounts of property were concentrated under a single manager, which allowed for economies of scale. Someone with a 10,000 acre estate can engage in agricultural strategies that benefit from economies of scale in a way that a yeoman with 40 acres and a mule cannot. But, the importance of the economy of scale justification for inheritance greatly declined when institutions like trusts and corporations made it possible to consolidate management of large quantities of assets without giving all of the benefit of those assets to the person managing them. You can equitably divide shares in a corporation causing the wealth associated with the corporation to be equitably divided, without giving shareholders a meaningful say in anything other than deciding which single CEO will be appointed to run the company when the current CEO is unwilling or unable to act. Inheritances meaningfully increase economic inequality between families and between classes of people. The recipients of inheritances often receive great wealth that someone else would be more qualified to manage. And every time you reward someone in the economy for the accident of their birth, you are simultaneously not providing an incentive for someone who has economic merit. (If someone has both very lucky birth and extreme merit, they don't need an inheritance to be wealthy themselves based on merit, so the net benefit to the economy from inheritances received by that person are modest.) Basically, inheritances push us towards a winner take all economy in which lots of people who would be highly rewarded in a fully meritocratic society are undercompensated and may decline to fully utilize their abilities knowing that fact. Winner take all economies divert effort of highly able people from producing economic value that increases the size of the pie for everyone, to ""rent seeking"" which decides who gets the existing bounty without contributing to the total amount of wealth in the economy. Rent seeking involves significant expenses that are dead weight loss to society. Frequently rent seeking costs in a conflict by all parties to a conflict can equal or exceed the economic rent that is at stake (e.g. the aggregate litigation costs of parties in a lawsuit over who owns an income producing asset). In addition, economic rent seeking diverts resources from more productive economic activity. Now, if you live in a society whose wealth primarily derives from rents and income from the ownership of property, and individual efforts to engage in creating new wealth are fairly insignificant in the overall picture of the society's economy (e.g. Saudi Arabia or Medieval France), having an economy that revolves largely around rent seeking and privileges inherited wealth isn't a serious problem for the society. But, if economic rents are a pretty small share of the society's total wealth and economic production, then favoring rent seeking behavior in a winner take all economy that ends up that way through the great importance of inherited wealth, at the relative expense of people who have merit and generate new wealth through their own efforts, is a catastrophe. Another problem with high levels of economic inequality is that lots of resources have to be devoted to gatekeeping and guarding the wealth of the wealthy from those denied wealth, which isn't necessary to nearly the same degree in more egalitarian societies. This expenditure is basically wasted economic capacity. And, if inheritance becomes too important relative to earning income, eventually your very political system becomes unstable and the poor meritocrats will revolt and depose the dumb money. This isn't just an abstract possibility. We think of the late 1940s to early 1960s as a time of national tranquility and prosperity in the U.S., but the truth is that it was an incredibly turbulent time in terms of domestic labor unrest. One of the reasons that the U.S. has one of the tamest labor forces and weakest unions in the developed world after unfathomably intense labor actions from the late 1940s to the early 1960s, is that colleges and universities shifted to meritocratic admissions, expanded higher educational capacity, and financed higher education through the GI Bill and public colleges, so that people who didn't have great wealth could advance to their full meritocratic potential. People who were shut out of the upper middle class until then and became union leaders instead, were coopted into the establishment based upon their abilities and the content of their character. Anti-discrimination laws also cut down these barriers, and taxes in this period for the wealthy were very high indeed, including inheritance taxes. As wealth inequality limits the ability of talented people with little inherited wealth to succeed again, those people will devote themselves to undermining the system rather than being coopted by it and advancing it. Finally, from a primarily ethical perspective, with great wealth comes great responsibility and this maxim applies at a societal level as well as an individual level. In a society that has vast wealth sufficient to eliminate the suffering and privation of the poor, allowing people who were lucky enough to be born rich to have vast wealth while redistributing none of this unearned societal wealth to those who profoundly need it, is inherently unethical and unjust. An inheritance tax takes from people who have done nothing to deserve wealth and don't need it, and gives it to people who direly need it or to other worthy societal goals. Another key point to realize in the particular case of the United States is that lots of wealth of most wealthy people takes the form of capital gains, i.e. appreciation in the value of property like real estate and business stock, that has never been subject to any income taxation. Under U.S. tax law, all accrued capital gains in property owned at death are tax free. So, but for an inheritance tax, all of those capital gains (which clearly meet the definition of income) are never taxed at all to anyone. Thus, in the U.S. tax system, an inheritance tax ensures the unrealized capital gains of people who die are taxed at least once. Death is a natural time to do this, because a transfer of the asset must take place anyway at this point. The ability to totally escape capital gains by holding onto assets also discourages people from selling assets when, but for taxes, that would be the economically efficient choice. Also, the prospect of inheritance taxation prevents economic resources from being skewed too far towards capital gain producing activities and away from income producing activities. For example, without an inheritance tax, more resources would shift to zero sum real estate investments that rely on appreciation in real estate values and away from retailing and manufacturing and construction sectors that generate current income more than capital gains. Canada, in contrast, for example, treats death as a deemed sale of capital assets to the inheritors under its income tax, which makes an inheritance tax somewhat less important for revenue protection purposes."
"Why is the US ranked as #45 in Press Freedom ratings, despite its extremely permissive free speech laws?","You need to keep in mind that the press freedom ratings is not a measure of freedom of speech, but freedom of the press, and the US is still ranked as ""fairly good"". Specifically, the index describes itself: What does it measure? The Index ranks 180 countries and regions according to the level of freedom available to journalists. It is a snapshot of the media freedom situation based on an evaluation of pluralism, independence of the media, quality of legislative framework and safety of journalists in each country and region. It does not rank public policies even if governments obviously have a major impact on their country’s ranking. They also provide more detail about their methodology and the questionnaire used to create the index is available online. I was unable to find a full report, but in a short analysis, the index specifically mentions Trumps hostility to the media. They go into a bit more depth about this in a press release for the 2017 data: In 2017, the 45th President of the United States helped sink the country to 45th place by labeling the press an “enemy of the American people” in a series of verbal attacks toward journalists, attempts to block White House access to multiple media outlets, routine use of the term “fake news” in retaliation for critical reporting, and calling for media outlets’ broadcasting licenses to be revoked. President Trump has routinely singled out news outlets and individual journalists for their coverage of him, and retweeted several violent memes targeting CNN. The violent anti-press rhetoric from the White House has been coupled with an increase in the number of press freedom violations at the local level as journalists run the risk of arrest for covering protests or simply attempting to ask public officials questions. Reporters have even been subject to physical assault while on the job. However, the Trump effect has only served to amplify the disappointing press freedom climate that predated his presidency. Whistleblowers face prosecution under the Espionage Act if they leak information of public interest to the press, while there is still no federal “shield law” guaranteeing reporters’ right to protect their sources. Journalists and their devices continue to be searched at the US border, while some foreign journalists are still denied entry into the US after covering sensitive topics like Colombia’s FARC or Kurdistan."
Why are masks a political topic in the US?,"David Easton (a major figure in modern political science) defined governance as the 'authoritative allocation of values', meaning that a government decides what values the community it serves will hold as important, productive, and meaningful. Governance in this sense is the answer to the question: ""How do we as a nation allocate our collective time and resources?"" Should we send a rocket to the moon? Should we prioritize the fight against cancer? Should we guarantee food security or medical care for all? Should we focus on innovation and economic success? A government might even choose to invest heavily in the military or police, which is consistent with the more familiar aphorism (derived from sociology) that 'a government holds a monopoly on the legitimate use of force.' But again, 'force' in this context is not arbitrary; force is applied by a government to ensure that certain values are upheld. We might disagree with the values being imposed, and thus disagree that such use of force is legitimate, but that merely reinforces the idea that the allocation of values is a central feature of government. With that in mind, a topic is political when it involves making decisions about how we will allocate the collective resources and efforts of the community. Tasks which require collective, community-wide involvement — be they as prosaic as building a highway between cities, or as esoteric as strengthening the foundations of the economy — necessarily invoke political question where different people might disagree about what course of action is best. Such political questions inevitably boil to discussions of what we value as a community. The use of prophylactic masks to control a pandemic was destined to be political issue. For masks to work as a preventative measure, everyone in the community has to agree to use them; there is a value to wearing masks that must be allocated authoritatively so that it applies universally and consistently. This exercise of authority may be as simple as public pleas from authority figures, or public education by medical professionals; or as extreme as lockdowns, quarantines, or legal penalties for non-compliance. Or authority could bend in the other direction, asserting that other values supersede the values of life and health (a value sometimes invoked to encourage military service, but which is rarely effective in other contexts). This first is the path that most nations of the world have followed, and citizens of other nations have generally complied, if grumblingly, because they have been convinced that not wearing masks will do harm to their friends, neighbors, and countries. The politics is still there; this is still an issue of the authoritative allocation of values. But there is such broad agreement with the value in question that the issue is not particularly contentious. Wearing masks is seen as a small price to pay for a potentially large reward to others in the nation, so most people buckle-down and do it. The US context is somewhat different. Over the past three or four decades the US has seen the rise of a strong nationalist1 movement which resists most forms of authority except its own. This movement explicitly rejects most public intellectual/academic sources of reasoning — the sources that would normally be used to construct values in this situation — and aggressively counter and contradict any efforts to build public agreement on such values. There is a lot of history behind this — disputes over evolution, abortion, climate change and green technology; social critiques of slavery and race relations, the decimation of native Americans, or the wealth divide; rising cultural conflicts like feminism, globalization, LGBTQ issues... — which has given rise to a lot of frustrated anger within conservatives generally, and has motivated this nationalist movement in particular. Issues like 'mask wearing' — which are expressly political, but would normally be considered neutral and innocuous — become contentious here because they are interpreted as just one more way in which the government tries to impose unwanted values. It is a visceral, gut-level reaction against what they perceived as a persistent, oppressive pontification from 'intellectuals' on the left; The movement and its supporter reject wearing masks mainly because it's something they can control among a host of things they cannot (e.g., ""I can't make gay marriages stop, but you can't make me wear this d*mned mask""). We could get into the roots of this nationalist movement — why it arose, who benefits from it, what the various issues are) — but that's not the meaningful point. The point is that there are a large number of conservatives in the US who are frustrated with progressives having political control over the allocation of national values — mainly in social policy — and this has culminated in an active movement which has turned to simple disruption to make its displeasure heard. It rejects scientific, academic, and intellectual authority not because it thinks such are wrong, but because it has come to hold that much of scientific and intellectual authority is merely a political tool used by the Left to push its agendas. And since this movement has risen to take control of many (if not most) of prominent leadership positions in the Conservative movement more broadly — not to mention into the White House and Cabinet — it has managed to become the dominant voice in conservatism. Masks have become a public symbol of political overreach in their minds: one that they wish to use for anti-Democrat messaging. 1The term 'nationalist' follows George Orwell's ""Notes on Nationalism"". He himself acknowledges that the word-choice isn't the best, but uses it because there isn't a better. The nutshell (tldr) is that nationalists are people who invest themselves in an idea so completely that the political success of that idea becomes their foremost concern. Often this idea is the idea of an actual nation (e.g., those overly preoccupied with asserting the greatness of their country), but it can just as easily be applied to a religion, political ideology, ethnic group, or any other abstract group that could be imagined to have its own sovereign status."
What are the benefits for the US in declaring Jerusalem as Israel's capital?,"Rallying his base and making good on a campaign promise. Evangelical Christians in the US voice strong political support for Israel and this group overwhelmingly voted for Trump and was pivotal for his victory. This was a hard won constituency as Ted Cruz fashioned himself as champion of the Evangelicals during primaries and support was split between Cruz, Rubio, and Trump, and Trump has many moral foibles that could serve to put off Evangelicals. Trump needed to do something to keep them in his court and this is a low-hanging fruit as the only fallout is anger from foreign leaders, something Trump has shown he doesn't care much about (Paris Accord, German Trade, too many examples to list).  This isn't just an Evangelical issue, the majority of republicans sympathize with Israel on the Israel/Palestine conflict, but this is a much more pertinent issue to Evangelicals because of the religious ramifications than it is to the broader republican base. The US gains nothing from this. It is true that Trump gains some goodwill from Israel as a result from this. What I mean is this action in and of itself doesn't translate into any tangible benefit for the U.S. as a country. "
Why is vote counting made so laborious in the US?,"Mail-in voting and provisional ballots: In many states, mail-in votes are allowed to arrive well after election day, provided they are postmarked on or before election day. Voters who cast a provisional ballot on or before election day are also given an opportunity to ""cure"" it. In practice, this usually consists of going to the county registrar and showing their ID within the next few days after the election, but specific requirements vary by state. It is physically impossible to count ballots which have not arrived, and it is similarly impossible to get an accurate count of provisional ballots until you know which ones are valid. Because of the pandemic, 2020 has seen unprecedented mail-in voting compared to previous election cycles. However, nearly every election cycle sees a significant number of late ballots from members of the armed forces and Americans living abroad. Provisional ballots are a relatively recent development, but they are not unusual either. In most election cycles, these ballots are not sufficient to change the outcome, which is why (for example) 2016 was called so early compared to 2020. But 2016's results were not official on election day. For example, California formally ascertained its electoral college appointments (pursuant to 3 USC 6) on December 12, 2016, which is well over a month after election day (November 8). Of course, everyone already knew that Hillary Clinton had won the state, but it wasn't official until that document was filed. Sheer scale: 70,000 people is rather small by American standards. You might see a similar number of votes cast in a smaller suburban or exurban county. For the big counties that materially affect the outcome of the race, they typically have hundreds of thousands to millions of votes to count. Even with a large number of people, optical scanners, etc. working continuously around the clock, this process will take time. And then, of course, at some point you're going to want official results. To do that, the counties have to report upwards to the state, because electoral votes are allocated at the state level. The state has to wait for every single county to count and report every single vote. If the race is close, the state may then have to conduct a recanvass or recount, which takes even longer. State law variations: Florida, for example, counted its vote quite fast this year, reporting most of its unofficial results within hours of the polls closing. Pennsylvania, on the other hand, took much longer. This is in part because Florida law allows counties to begin processing mail-in ballots before election day, and Pennsylvania law does not. Complexity of ballots: In most countries, you vote for one or two things at a time. In the US, we routinely have all of the following on the ballot at once: Some states do state and municipal elections in ""off-year"" (odd-numbered) elections, which fall between federal election cycles. But most states don't. Differing priorities and budget: The target date for certification of final results in 2020 is December 8. This is the last day on which a state's electoral college votes will be presumed lawful (by Congress, which will count said votes in January), and so that is the date that most states shoot for. Trying to count millions of ballots faster than that would probably be doable, but it would cost more, and it's not clear how a faster count would materially benefit the residents of a given state. California routinely takes a month to count its ballots, but the residents don't seem particularly upset about that."
Why do UK politicians seemingly ignore opinion polls on Brexit?,"It was discussed in the discussion on one of the online petitions. The standard Tory line against it is: 17.4 million people voted to leave. After that, 499 Members of Parliament voted in favour of invoking article 50, and 122 voted against But Brexit, as currently being operated, is not a public-driven process. Even if it was, making it opinion-poll-driven on small daily fluctuations between 49/51 one way and the other would make no sense either. No, the absolute driving motivation is to keep the Tory party together and in power. There has been a risk of a split over Europe since at least the days of John Major. Everyone is aware that under the FPTP system a split would be completely fatal to the party. This causes an endless cycle of making concessions to one group within the party to prevent them defecting, followed by the discovery that those concessions have angered another wing of the party, or are infeasible to deliver, or the EU won't agree to them, and so on. It also explains the weird stasis where the government is unable to command a majority for its flagship legislation but has not yet lost a vote of no confidence."
Is there any record of Trickle Down Economics improving the economy?,"But I'm looking for an objective, non partisan explanation of whether or not Trickle Down economics has been effective in the past People debate whether economics is a hard or soft science, but I think it's fair to say that even if it's a hard science, conclusions can still differ and, at the end of the day, economic policy certainly can, and often is, partisan to some degree. All that said, there's a lot of economists that point out that trickle-down economics is not a real thing: We find that increasing the income share of the poor and the middle class actually increases growth while a rising income share of the top 20 percent results in lower growth—that is, when the rich get richer, benefits do not trickle down. -- Dabla-Norris et al., 2015   A recent book published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) supports the IMF study’s assertion that inequality suppresses economic growth. Both studies relied heavily on the Gini Coefficient, a measurement of income distribution in which a score of 0 represents a society in which all wealth is shared completely equally and a score of 1 a society in which all the wealth belongs to a single person (currently, the United States has a high Gini Coefficient of .4, falling only behind Chile, Mexico, and Turkey in this measurement of inequality for OECD countries.) The OECD study found that an increase in inequality on the Gini scale of two points corresponded to a 4.7% drop in GDP. -- Quartz More recently, there was this ad-hoc survey of executives during a talk by Gary Cohn (Trump's chief economic adviser) asking if they will take money gained from corporate tax cuts and re-invest (ie, ""trickle them down""). The response was, to put it bluntly, underwhelming. And this article points out a key aspect: Trickle-down economics, in its pure form, was never tested. -- The Balance That last article points out some past situations where tax cuts claiming to be 'trickle down' policies were enacted in a time where we did see economic growth, there were side effects, and several other factors, so it's impossible to say that the tax cuts did what they were promised. As such, there is no proof that trickle-down economics works, though there is plenty of data showing that increasing the income gap isn't good for economies. Of course, that doesn't mean the theory isn't valid...it's just that we have never (and may never) be able to validate it. Ironically(?) if the current republican tax bill is passed into law, it may prove difficult for them to argue trickle down policy works as we currently have a growing economy. It'll be tough to show it works unless there is some level of exponential growth compared to the already upward trending current curve, and if it drops and/or the economy significantly slows, it'd put another black mark on arguments for that particular theory."
How does Donald Trump Jr. benefit from releasing the e-mails he released?,"According to CNN, the emails were released by Donald Trump Jr. shortly before they were going to be published by the New York Times. From this article, we read: Trump Jr. tweeted that he was releasing the emails to be ""totally transparent,"" but his release came moments before The New York Times published the content of the emails. The only options for Donald Trump Jr. would be to deny it or try to accept that the mails were going to be public and working on that assumption. In the face of the importance of the issues, it is to be expected that these e-mails are going to be included into the ongoing probes1 about Russian meddling in the presidential campaign and Trump's team collusion with Russia, and that would lead to -very likely- Donald Trump Jr. being forced to testify. If Donald Trump Jr. were to testify, his options would be either: Accept the evidence. Refuse to answer (use the 5th Ammendment). Lie under oath and risk perjury charges. '#1 and #2 lead to admit (explicitly or implicitly) that the e-mails are indeed true. So, (if we discard #3) claiming that the emails are false it would only lead to Trump Jr. being forced to rectify, only that at a later time (during which the issue would not be forgotten) and with yet more damage to his credibility. By releasing the e-mail he may (attempt to) claim that he was ""not hiding anything"" and try to get as much of a positive spin2 from it as possible, under the current circumstances. For example, his release in twitter was accompanied by affirmations that what he did was ok and which (despite no legal expert agreeing with that) are already being repeated by his supporters. Other possible advantages that I can think of (although I will admit that these are a little twisted; I would be surprised if those were the main reasons but they could have helped in making the decision): It takes away the spotlight from the New York Times article that would (most probably) be very critical of the situation described in the emails. This allows the emails to be presented to the public through some news organizations that are known to justify everything the Trump government does and dismiss any criticism of it, no matter what. It ""steals"" the New York Times part of the publicity/brand recognition it would have got for the publication of the emails. 
1If such a story goes as far as to being published, it is reasonable to assume that the journalist has evidence enough to prove that the emails are indeed Donald Trump Jr.'s. 2This is usually called controlling the narrative."
Why is consensus so controversial in Britain?,"""Freedom of the press in Britain means freedom to print such of the proprietor's prejudices that the advertisers don't object to"" Americans like to believe their press is neutral. In the UK, hardly anyone bothers to maintain this pretence, and the press are openly engaged as political factions. The press circulation is much larger than the membership of the political parties, and has an impact beyond its actual numbers in terms of influencing opinion. The three largest papers are the Sun (owned by Murdoch's News Corp), the Daily Mail (owned by Viscount Rothermere), and the Times (News Corp again). All have a right-wing anti-Europe stance, and will happily print inaccurate articles about Europe. Boris Johnson got a particularly bad reputation for this while working as a journalist before he was a minister. He is still employed as a journalist, and is in fact paid more for that than his role as a Minister of the Crown. The press benefit from controversy: it sells papers. Readers enjoy outrage bait that panders to their prejudices; a pre-internet version of the ""fake news"" problem. Sidebar: the Spiked/LM axis There is a small group of people who used to write for Living Marxism until it was sued out of existence for denying the Bosnian genocide, then formed a successor Spiked!. They seem to be surprisingly influential in the commentariat despite their small size, and despite the intellectual incoherency of having gone straight from revolutionary communism to libertarianism without passing through common sense on the way. One of these people is Brendan O'Neill. Another is Claire Fox, now Baroness Fox of Buckley. A similar story prevails here. What ought to be a discussion show has succumbed to the temptation of getting on the most extreme guests possible, provoking highly strung arguments, and letting planted audience members inject outrageous questions. Edit: another example of the revolving door: the man who ran the BBC's political output during the Brexit campaign was later appointed as Theresa May's director of communications and is a ""hard Brexiteer"". The leaders of the country overwhelmingly come from a very narrow educational background: private school followed by Oxford PPE. This produces people with a bulletproof opinion of their own correctness and practice in intellectual bullying. This mostly manifests as a belief that Britain can ""punch above its weight"", and therefore does not need to engage in international compromise. While the influence of this in negotiations with Europe is obvious, I would argue that it also prevails internally. (This is easily a graduate-thesis size investigation!). It seems to me that the country is run centrally as a tiny empire. Councils have little power and little funding autonomy; council tax rates can be capped centrally, and they are dependent on ""block grant"". The relatively recent devolved assemblies also get little respect from Westminster; the Scotland Office and Wales Office still exist despite seeming redundancy. The Scotland Office has a substantial budget for anti-independence campaigning. The situation is even worse in Northern Ireland, land of No Surrender, where there has been no government for about two years following its collapse over a fraud scandal. Compromise is even more foreign there. People tend to forget that the UK had a live-fire civil war in living memory, but I think that matters to the uncompromisingness. The voting system at Westminster discourages coalition or minority governments, so there is no tradition of sound coalition-forming by seeking consensus. Edit: as a piece of metacommentary, this is the first time I've noticed an answer getting significant numbers of upvotes and downvotes. I am aware that it can be considered opinionated, but I think that's a symptom of the polarisation that leads to no consensus. Politically engaged people disagree on increasingly basic things."
"What is meant by the ""left"" and the ""right""?","The standard terms of left and right politics originate from the seating arrangement of the French National Assembly of 1789. They are often considered overly simplistic for today's complex political landscape. In the 1789 at the French National Assembly the First Estate (noblemen) sat on the right side and the Third Estate (revolutionaries) sat on the left side. Thus, the left wing of the room was more liberal, and the right wing was more conservative. Today you often use the terms left or extreme-left to describe social and progressive measures and right or even extreme-right the more conservative and nationalistic approaches. Those terms as I stated in the first paragraph however are too simplistic for a modern world where libertarians are often very progressive (left) on social issues such as gay marriage but are fiscally very conservative (right)."

2000*3 + 0*2 + 1500*1 = 7500

1500*3 + 1500*2 + 500*1 = 8000

100*3 + 3325*2 + 75*1 = 7025
National Front:
300*3 + 2800*2 + 400*1 = 6900   As you can see, both the results and margins are the same. While there may well be cognitive differences (voting against might seem more aggressive than simply giving the lowest score, people may be more likely give the middle score as it is inaction) there are no mathematical changes based on the range you choose. This means that this method has the same advantages and drawbacks as range voting. While it may appear to violate Arrow's Impossibility Theorem, that is because it is a cardinal voting method, while the ""universality"" criterion of Arrow's theorem effectively restricts that result to ordinal voting methods.
It also fails both the Condorcet and Majority criteria. Range voting has never been implemented for a national election."
Why is there a broad pattern of excessive force by police towards protestors in spite of international focus on this use of force?,"One data point seems to be the 75 year old who was seriously injured when he was knocked backwards by police. When the policemen who did this were suspended the entire squad resigned from the Emergency Response Team (but not their day jobs) in protest. John Evans, president of the local police union, told the newspaper: ""Our position is these officers were simply following orders from Deputy Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia to clear the square.  This suggests that excessive violence is such an ingrained part of police culture that they simply cannot understand the civilian point of view. To them it is simply a part of their job and therefore not ""excessive"". (Edit: those wanting to argue that this doesn't count because of provocation should see this question.)"
"What is the meaning of ""Cancel Culture""?","A new*, deliberately pejorative, term to describe an old phenomenon, that of pressuring individuals or companies through the media when you disagree with their views, often in the ethnic/sexual orientation/religious/political spheres. Admittedly, it is associated, on the right, with the increasingly strident voices that are on the left, like the great beans boycott. But it has older antecedents, including on the right, like a proposed boycott of Disney in 97 because it ""promoted homosexuality"". Basically, it is justified activism when you agree with the action, cancel culture when you don't. However, cancel culture is more a right-side slogan and the left has yet to come with an equivalently pejorative catchy term for the just-as-agitated right activists.  For now, it remains, thankfully, a largely USA-centric term. Edit:  I am not at all interested in debating the finer points of who is right or wrong or how justified the term is. Only in pointing out its elegant slogan power.  It's brilliant, very ""turn your enemy's strength against them"". The left's best bet, IMHO, is just to own it and use it to criticize whatever right-side boycott campaigns they see. Unlike say tax and spend, it has no builtin ideological connotation. And, if say both sides refrained from frivolous name-calling to avoid being tarred by this label... one can only dream. * Google ngram doesn't find it, as it stops in 2019 (replace cancel with world and you can see ngram works fine with a different term). But... (thanks, J...), Google Trends does and show an April 2019 rampup. And, credit to Fizz, this seems to have been the first mainstream negative use of it: The writer Shanita Hubbard used the phrase in a tweet about the controversy surrounding Gabby Douglas in November 2017. The Olympic gymnast was ostensibly canceled after she appeared to blame survivors of sexual assault; in response to her teammate Aly Raisman's tweet about sexual assault, Douglas said that ""it is our responsibility as women to dress modestly and be classy."" Responding to the backlash against Douglas, Hubbard tweeted: ""Let's talk 'cancel culture.' Personally, I am willing to give a lot of grace to young Black girls simply because the world doesn't."" The tweet got more than 6,000 likes. —Shanita Hubbard (@msshanitarenee) November 18, 2017 The phrase continued to gain popularity on Twitter in late 2017, with several people writing ""cancel culture"" in quotation marks to describe the trend. Insider found that most of those tweets referred to cancel culture negatively."
"What did Reagan mean when he said: ""The nine most terrifying words in the English language are 'I'm from the government, and I'm here to help.' ""?","Reagan made the statement during The President's News Conference, and understanding the context of the event can help establish his meaning.  It's worth mentioning that I've seen some indications that the saying wasn't coined by Reagan, but was in general use as far back as the 70s. I'd say he was referring to the belief (often held by conservative voters in the United States), that the government, in general, is incredibly inefficient in everything that they do.  Sometimes to such a degree that their attempts to help end up actively harming instead.  This was also suggested by Reagan during his 1981 Inaugural address. The view that Reagan was expressing tended to be a precursor to calls for smaller government, where an individual or private organization could complete an action more effectively than the government doing the same."
What's the political reason that acknowledging genocide is such a 'big deal'?,"Acknowledging genocide is a big deal, precisely because genocide is a big deal. It is considered to be the highest, worst, most inhumane, most heinous, most vicious crime of all crimes. It is the original and first crime to be called a crime against humanity, in fact, it is the crime for which this term was invented. These crimes are so bad that they are considered not just to be committed against their immediate victims, but all of humanity itself. Acknowledging genocide is essentially the State-level equivalent to taking out an advertisement at prime time in every TV channel in the entire world, proclaiming that you are a child rapist. How would you feel about that? Especially if you think that you are innocent? Because that is another reason it is a big deal: Turkey does not acknowledge the genocide. So, this acknowledgment is not just accusing them of the worst possible crime (a crime which they feel they are not guilty of), but also effectively calling them a liar. Additionally, it is a big deal because many countries have laws that give their courts universal jurisdiction over some particularly heinous crimes, often including genocide. It is a big deal, because it might make it possible for Armenian-Americans to sue the State of Turkey for damages in a US court. And lastly, it is a big deal because it is at least somewhat hypocritical: the US has yet to acknowledge the first genocide of the modern era: the genocide of the American indigenous people. (Although note that some States, e.g. California, have.)"
Why does the US President use a new pen for each order?,"It's a tradition and the pens are given out later as souvenirs. From this TIME article: The rationale is fairly simple. The pen used to sign historic legislation itself becomes a historical artifact. The more pens a President uses, the more thank-you gifts he can offer to those who helped create that piece of history. The White House often engraves the pens, which are then given as keepsakes to key proponents or supporters of the newly signed legislation. During President Trump's first signing ceremony, he used multiple pens too, later given to the Members of Congress who had attended.  (The pens are placed on Trump's right.) Source: https://us.cnn.com/videos/politics/2017/01/20/donald-trump-first-law-pens-orig-mg.cnn/video/playlists/atv-road-to-the-white-house-automated/ President Obama famously used 22 pens to sign Obamacare into law. The White House released a video then explaining the tradition. Obama used 22 pens to sign health care reform legislation into law in March of 2010. He used a different pen for each letter or half letter of his name. ""This is gonna take a little while,"" Obama said.  Source: https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/obama-legacy/obamacare.html Recently, Speaker Nancy Pelosi also used multiple pens when signing the articles of impeachment during Trump's first impeachment.

In the US why is nationalism equated with racism?,"There are various forms of ""Nationalism"", but one prevalent belief is that ""My Nation is better than others"". Racism can be broadly understood to be the belief that ""My race is better than others"". Given how close these ideas are, it isn't surprising that there are many nationalists who are also racist. This is particularly the case for the so-called ""white nationalists"" who believe that ""white people"" form a nation. Their nationalist beliefs are explicitly racist. This doesn't mean that all forms of Nationalism are necessarily racist. Some forms of Nationalism don't believe that ""My nation is better"" but instead ""My nation should have its own government"". Thus Nicola Sturgeon is a nationalist, but not a racist. On the other hand, the BNP in the UK is both Nationalist and Racist (According to BNP founder John Tyndall, ""The BNP is a racial nationalist party which believes in Britain for the British, that is to say racial separatism."") The notion of ""nation"" as it applies to America is tricky. Nationalists in Europe are often opposed to immigration, but the majority of Americans are descended from immigrants. Nationalists, therefore, seek another way to distinguish ""Us"" from ""them"", and use race and language as a proxy for nation. And so especially in America are nationalists equated to racists, simply because many nationalists in America are racist."
Why is the debate on the composition of the U.S. Supreme Court so politicised?,"This is the confluence of a large number of factors, several of which appear in other answers, but I'll focus on just two. The United States has one of the shortest (and oldest) written constitutions in the world.  It started with less than 5 thousand words and remains under 8 thousand after twenty seven amendments (with one repealed).  By contrast, the constitution of India, adopted in 1950, has over 146 thousand words.   As a consequence of its brevity, many of the passages of the US Constitution are very vague and non-specific. This means the judiciary has very little to work with. This in turn creates a fertile field for politicization. Something which seems constitutional under one interpretation of one line/section may seem unconstitutional under another interpretation (of another line/section). And the entire constitutionality of something can hinge upon how one defines a given word or phrase. For example, many modern era decisions by the SCOTUS rely on the commerce clause or due process clause. But these don't say much more than ""Congress can regulate interstate commerce"" and ""everyone has a right to due process"", respectively.  But there is no definition of what ""regulate"", ""interstate"", ""commerce"", or ""due process"" is (or even ""everyone""). As such, how a jurist interprets the constitution—such as what these undefined words and ambiguous, imprecise statements actually mean—becomes a major factor in how that jurist renders decisions and decides constitutional and legal matters. This in turn tends to correlate strongly with political ideology, though in a somewhat skewed sense: it correlates to a party's ideology moreso than the judge's (historically speaking). It is not always easy to predict how a judge will rule when holding a lifetime position, but any given political ideology will have certain judicial philosophies which are more amenable to its goals. The relatively great power of the SCOTUS (far stronger than the UK's), and the lifetime appointments, make it a premium target for shaping the long term political future.  Provided you put someone on the court who tends to rule in your favor. Which brings me to the second factor. Seriously hate it. Not that I expect liberals would be any different with a judge they thought would be liberal turning out to be a conservative, but this simply hasn't happened that often.  As a historical matter, (federal) judges as a group trend to the political left over their tenure. The people and intellectual groups the judges naturally associated with were already left-leaning, which helped pull them to the left. Thus a self-enforcing selection bias was present: leaning and pulling to the left eliminated and discouraged more ardently right-leaning potential jurists. Eventually, conservatives grew tired of Republican presidents nominating Supreme Court nominees that ended up being liberal.  Thus organizations such as the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society arose in 1973 and 1982, respectively. These provided right-leaning legal societies, so jurists wouldn't be pulled to the left by left-leaning colleagues; they could stay firmly entrenched on the right. One of their major goals is to ensure that Republican presidents never again nominate a candidate who wasn't a sure-thing conservative. These are also exactly the organizations who compiled Trump's short list of potential Supreme Court nominees."
We will never surrender! Why would a country have this policy?,"We will never surrender! has a pretty famous history.   The obvious advantage of such a policy is that it makes invasion less likely.  Let's assume that Russia invades Sweden.  A natural step would be to kill politicians until they find one that is willing to say that people should not resist and should instead return to their homes.  So plans that Russia might make now would include such a step.  But Sweden has already sent out this pamphlet explaining that that's not what to do.  So in an actual invasion, many Swedes would ignore the politicians calling for submission.  Russia may choose a more amenable invasion target.   As you note, once invaded, such a policy is less helpful.   In terms of other countries, I would point out that there is a small but significant group of people in the United States who believe that it is important to stockpile weapons in case of potential invasion.  The movie Red Dawn was about such a scenario.  "
"Why do US police use handcuffs in otherwise calm, non-violent circumstances?","Why do US police use handcuffs in otherwise calm, non-violent circumstances? Because they have cause to fear escalation and because their training encourages it. Since the question mentions UK currency and US policing, we can compare the two countries: The US population is five times that of the UK. However deaths of police officers are 50 times as numerous. About 50 police officers killed in 2019 in USA, about one policeman killed a year in UK. A police force in a US city of 1 million might deal with 50 intentional homicides a year.
A police force in a UK city of 1 million might deal with 12 intentional homicides a year. This might account for some increased wariness and caution by US police officers US police officers always have firearms. 95% of UK police officers do not carry any firearms. Although it might seem that UK police officers are more vulnerable and might therefore be more inclined to use handcuffs or other restraints, it may be that UK police rely on the people they interact with knowing that the policeman in front of them won't shoot them. It is often said that UK policing is more consent oriented: Policing by consent (UK) lists the principles of policing set out in 1829 as: To prevent crime and disorder, as an alternative to their repression by military force and severity of legal punishment. To recognise always that the power of the police to fulfil their functions and duties is dependent on public approval of their existence, actions and behaviour and on their ability to secure and maintain public respect. and so on. Public approval is No 2 on that list. In the USA, public opinion is less important, it comes in around principle 6 in this LAPD list UK police policy on use of handcuffs Any intentional application of force to the person of another is an assault. The use of handcuffs amounts to such an assault and is unlawful unless it can be justified. Justification is achieved through establishing not only a legal right to use handcuffs but also good objective grounds for doing so in order to show that what the officer or member of police staff did was reasonable necessary and proportionate use of force. USA (LAPD) Guidance The principle reason for handcuffing an arrestee is to maintain control of the individual
and to minimize the possibility of a situation escalating to a point that would necessitate
using a higher level of force or restraint. The decision to use restraining procedures and
devices depends on common sense and good judgment. While felony arrestees shall
normally be handcuffed, the restraining of misdemeanants is discretionary. There is a clear difference in tone. The UK starts with the presumption that handcuffing is an assault. In the US it is introduced as a restraint."
How does North Korea prevent their ambassadors/diplomats living abroad from defecting?,"There have been a few high-profile ambassadors who did actually defect, the highest being the deputy ambassador in London in 2016.  As user4012's answer speculated, the regime does hold family members hostage. From the article:  North Korean diplomats generally must leave one member of their immediate family in Pyongyang — the regime’s insurance against defections — and it was not clear whether Thae had managed to take all of his family with him. I remember hearing a snippet of an interview recently, where he talked about this, as well."

"Is there a push, in the United States, to use gender-neutral language and gender pronouns (when they are given)?","Pronouns are a thing, but they aren’t the thing for the most part. They’re about simple interpersonal communication and respect (it’s no big deal to make a mistake, it’s pretty insulting to adamantly insist on using the wrong ones), but they tend not to be a major factor in, say, the political agendas of most feminist and/or LGBTQ communities, that I have seen. There are actually two separate issues: the gendering/gender neutrality of hypothetical persons (that is, using a gendered or gender-neutral pronoun to refer to “a person” who may be any gender), and the correct or incorrect gendering of specific individuals. The hypothetical person situation is an older concern of feminism; the objection is basically to the default use of “he” when referring to “a person” who is not necessarily male. The problem here was that—because for so long English-speaking countries had rather strict and stark gender roles that had most work done by men—many, many things were written using “man” or “he” when they weren’t necessarily (after mostly-20th-century equality movements) describing solely men. This happened with job titles (“police officer,” “firefighter,” “Congressperson”), and it happened with pronouns (“he or she” or the use of “they” in the singular). Styles guides for journalists and academics began to recommend these measures, and they became part of the broader culture; they were taught as the correct way to write in formal settings, they were used in media and news reports, and so on. There was some pushing and some pushing back on this, but much of that is over and done with. Not to say that everyone’s happy with the situation now and no one argues about it, but it doesn’t tend to come up in current events or debates very much. The more recent debate is about the gendering or misgendering of specific individuals. The debate is basically that some individuals have certain pronouns they prefer to have used with respect to themselves. This can be anything from a transgender person wanting to use the pronouns of their gender identity, to a cisgender person who defies gender stereotypes emphasizing that despite that defiance they still consider themselves to be their gender, to the various forms of Q under LGBTQ that may prefer not to use he or she at all. The other side of the debate basically believes that they ought to have the right to ignore those preferences and apply the labels that they personally feel ought to apply to another person, regardless of that person’s wishes. As transgender issues have risen in prominence recently, pronouns, particularly with respect to transgender folks, have come up in some debates as well. For example, Danica Roem is a member of the Virginia state House of Representatives, and was the first transgender person to be elected to any state legislature. She tried, as much as possible, to run her campaign without even mentioning that fact—her focus was on public transportation, for the most part, as I recall (I lived in Virginia at the time, but not in the district she was campaigning for). Her opponent, on the other hand, made a point of nastily misgendering her (using “he”), trying to make the campaign about her being transgender. This backfired for him: much of the electorate considered his statements unseemly, and she got a lot of respect for handling the issue well and then returning to her core campaign concerns, about the district rather than about herself. Another anecdote, also from Virginia: when I lived there, for a time I worked for a security contractor that was about 85% Veteran, mostly Army. One of the staff there—not, herself, a Veteran—came out as transgender and began transitioning, and asked for people to use her new name and pronouns. I worked with a lot of no-nonsense, tough, and conservative guys there—but nobody refused, nobody made an issue out of it. The most I heard was “seems weird to me, but whatever floats her boat, I guess.” This was northwestern Virginia, near DC, so a very liberal area in general; people might have felt more comfortable with objecting if they were surrounded by like-minded people. But the office itself was not particularly liberal, and there were plenty of people who didn’t care overmuch for the opinions of others (and in at least a couple of cases, I mean that quite critically—but even those still respected our co-worker’s transition enough to use the correct name and pronouns). Some communities are more serious about pronouns than others. Tumblr, for example, as an online community, has a lot of users who include their preferred pronouns as part of their introductory blurb at the top of their blogs, and a lot of users who will make a point of asking about pronouns when interacting through that medium with someone who doesn’t include them there. That is part of that community, and as an online community, you don’t have to be transgender for your pronouns to be unclear—if you don’t happen to blog about things that make your gender explicit, there would be no way of knowing. As a place where a lot of people who are sensitive about gendering (either because they are transgender, or also because they are not transgender but also defy gender roles), a heightened emphasis on pronouns is found there, and people are a bit more careful—and, as that becomes normalized within that community, a certain amount of care becomes expected, as well. But that’s a particular community with a particular niche that can be particularly devoted to this subject. The wider American public is less aware, less careful, and while I have no doubt that many Tumblr users would prefer that the rest of the world be more careful, as Tumblr is, the fact is that as of yet, it isn’t. The majority of people concerned with gendering care a whole lot more for people making an honest, good-faith effort to be welcoming and respectful, than they care about “getting it right” per se. Note that I come to this discussion as a cisgender male who has never experienced gender dysphoria in his life, and who doesn’t have a Tumblr blog. If someone were to misgender me—even if they were to do it blatantly and with intent to insult—I wouldn’t really care, beyond the general annoyance of someone getting in my face and trying to get a rise out of me, and that’s because ultimately, these are not concerns near or dear to my heart. I have quite a fair number of transgender friends, for whom it is of much greater importance, but that isn’t the same thing. I have asked several of them to read over this answer, and they’ve supported it. As the cases of Danica Roem and my former co-worker show, there isn’t really a lot of people getting all that worked up about this in daily life. Which is part of the reason that the handling of the issue of pronouns on Stack Exchange has caused such controversy: quite a number of LGBTQ users have felt that SE, while supposedly protecting them, have made a vastly larger issue out of things than was necessary (it is, at this point, unclear if any issue needed to be made out of Monica’s particular case, but a whole lot of information is still being kept private at this point), and that in overreacting SE has made the LGBTQ community look bad and harmed their reputation and their hopes for improved respect and acceptance."
Why does the Green New Deal push for green energy but not for nuclear energy?,"This is a broad topic, and for an overview I would suggest to look at the wikipedia article on the anti-nuclear movement. The main points are: Because of these reasons, nuclear energy isn't categorized as renewable (it depends on a non-renewable resource) or green (it at least has the potential to damage the environment to a high degree). Your point about energy efficiency is probably better addressed in a separate question. But see eg this question where I included a comparison on energy returned on energy invested; wind and hydro are well above nuclear, while solar is just a bit below it."
When was the Second Amendment last used to fight against the US government to protect people's freedom?,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rebellions_in_the_United_States suggests Wounded Knee in '73. In 1973 about 200 people mostly from a Lakota tribe took over a town on the site of a famous massacre. They held the town for 71 days sporadicly exchanging gunfire with law enforcement including the FBI. It was sparked by a failure of regular mechanisms to remove a elected official (he had goons). It quickly escalated to be about the US not honoring treaties with natives and many non-Lokota joined. It was fairly successful; popular opinion was in favor, the leaders were not sentenced and the phrase ""poor treatment of Native Americans in the film industry"" was first broadcast from Hollywood. The official served another 3 years after winning an election that was invalidated because of the actions of the goons, but later upheld."
Why does Donald Trump wield influence over Republican Congressmen & Senators?,"It's worth pointing out that Trump is not a 'leader' in the normal, political sense of the term, and his power doesn't lie in typical sociopolitical authority. Trump is (to borrow someone else's analogy) the Golden Idol that a certain segment of American society bows down to. They carry him before them as an icon and cry out that he is their leader, but Trump doesn't do the things we expect of a leader: set paths and agendas, create rules and order, provide structure, clarity, and direction. Trump effectively does nothing except rally his followers: stir them up and incite them to act out on their own (often problematic) impulses. Trump didn't start the movement, or organize it, or define it; he merely 'licensed his brand' to it, giving a diffuse and disorganized movement a banner to rally around. He seemingly has no interest in what they rally for so long as they rally around him, so he leaves it up to people in the movement to define what the movement is in his name. All things considered, Trump isn't much different from Q, except that there is a flesh-and-blood person somewhere behind the iconography of Trump (a person we don't know much about, because he consistently hides himself behind media and legal facades), while there is no such specific person behind the iconography of Q (who as far as anyone can tell is simply made-up). But both icons serve the same purpose of being a rallying point around which groups can organize themselves. It doesn't really make sense to ask what power Trump has over the GOP, any more than it makes sense to ask what power any charismatic leader holds. The concept of a 'charismatic leader' is ultimately empty and oxymoronic. A charismatic leader is like a man on horseback who drops the reins and uses the spurs; the horse thinks it's being guided by the rider, the rider enjoys the thrill of charging pell-mell onward, but the rider isn't in control and the horse would behave the same for anyone who dropped the reins and used the spurs. It's a symbiotic, almost parasitic relationship. The power Trump has (to follow this analogy) is merely the power to trample: to point his followers at someone and dig in the spurs, and let the sheer weight of all that unconstrained animal energy crush the target. It creates an odd and unhealthy dynamic: This is why people like McCarthy and Graham spend so much time visiting and talking to Trump, while others avoid him and speak about him in hushed tones. The former want to establish themselves as intimates of Trump — in other words, as people who can present themselves as though they speak in Trump's voice — while the latter merely want to make it through to their next term without pain and complications. As to the Trumpist base...I know I've been using a lot of religious ideation here (which shouldn't surprise people who look at the events of the last four years, but probably does), so apologies, but the base grants Trump this 'power to trample' because it wants salvation. The Right has been evolving into a 'grievance culture' since (at least) the '80s. It has developed a persistently angry sense of victimization — particularly among white Christian males — because it suffered a string of legal and political setbacks, with an associated implication of guilt and shame. Feminism pointed out the abuses that men have historically leveled against women; the civil rights movement highlighted the abuses whites have visited on blacks; the native American genocide, the failure of Christian theology to stand up against evolution, the comparative economic failure of rural blue-collar workers compared to urban and suburban white-collars, the destruction of the environment by selfish and gluttonous consumption... All this burden of shame was pushed onto the shoulders of a certain conservative segment of American society, but rather than face up to it they sought to negate it: to find someone who could save them from that pressure of guilt and shame. That's what Trump provided.  He told them they were good people; he told them that the bad people were the ones making them feel such guilt; he told them they had nothing to feel shame over, because it was all lies by nasty people and a lying media, but he knew the truth and only he could save them (make them great again). They bought into it because they wanted to buy into it, because not buying into it meant they would have to accept the changing face of the US and the load of shame that accompanied it. But they would have bought it from anyone who offered it; Trump just cornered the market first. But like any other faith, once one has bought into the soteriology it is extremely difficult to leave, because the salvation of one's entire identity rides on it."
Why would Madrid be so insistent on preventing the Catalonian independence referendum?,"By way of establishing some context, it's worth noting that this isn't just a squabble over which government has the authority to hold a referendum in Catalonia. The Madrid government's position is that not even it can grant independence, because the constitution directly prohibits it. Moreover, to amend the relevant article of the constitution would require super-majorities in both houses of parliament and a national referendum. Why would Madrid be so insistent on preventing the referendum from taking place, with the clear possibility of open conflict resulting from this, as opposed to simply declaring up front any outcome null and void because the Catalonian government lacks legal authority in the subject matter? There are a number of possible reasons, and only a very few politicians could tell you the rough weighting they have given to each, but among the relevant factors are:"
What specifically did Michael Flynn do wrong?,"According to the White House spokesperson Sean Spicer, Trump seemed to have requested the resignation of Flynn due to a ""trust issue"". President Donald Trump asked for Michael Flynn's resignation after he lost trust in his national security adviser for misleading Vice President Mike Pence over his calls with Russia's ambassador, the White House said Tuesday. ""The level of trust between the President and Gen. Flynn had eroded to the point where he felt he had to make a change,"" Spicer told reporters. ""The President was very concerned that Gen. Flynn had misled the vice president and others."" Trump therefore felt he could not trust his top foreign policy right-hand and on key national security issues like China and the Middle East, Spicer said. (emphasis mine) The Logan Act specifically states: Any citizen of the United States, wherever he may be, who, without authority of the United States, directly or indirectly commences or carries on any correspondence or intercourse with any foreign government or any officer or agent thereof, with intent to influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer or agent thereof, in relation to any disputes or controversies with the United States, or to defeat the measures of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. (emphasis mine) According to this BBC article which includes a timeline of the events, Flynn first spoke to the Russian ambassador in the US on Dec 28: 28 December: Mr Flynn and Russian ambassador to the US, Sergey Kislyak, exchange Christmas text messages by mobile phone Flynn then spoke to him after Obama introduced sanctions on Russia: 29 December: US President Barack Obama announces sanctions expelling 35 Russian diplomats for the country's alleged interference in the US presidential elections 29 December: Mr Flynn holds a phone call with the Russian ambassador Flynn took office together with President Trump and his executive team: 20 January 2017: President Trump and his executive team, including Mr Flynn, take office So, Flynn is still considered a private citizen before he took office on Jan 20. Thus, it's a violation of the Logan Act. As for prosecution, no one has been prosecuted under this act. This article by Vox states: No one has ever been prosecuted under the Logan Act, but Flynn is facing a second and potentially far more dangerous investigation. The FBI is actively probing Flynn’s interactions with Kislyak, and resigning from his White House post won’t shield Flynn from potential future criminal prosecution. Flynn resigned to avoid embarrassment to the Trump administration since he misled both the public and the Trump administration yet the Trump administration publicly defended him. As he stated in his resignation letter: ""I inadvertently briefed the Vice President-elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian ambassador. I have sincerely apologized to the President and the Vice President, and they have accepted my apology."" He denied the contact with the Russian ambassador in an interview on Feb 8. In a Feb. 8 interview with The Washington Post, Flynn categorically denied discussing sanctions with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, repeating public assertions made in January by top Trump officials. One day after the interview, Flynn revised his account, telling The Post through a spokesman that he “couldn’t be certain that the topic never came up.” (emphasis mine) Even the Vice-President Mike Pence defended him: Pence said in a Jan. 15 appearance on CBS’ “Face the Nation” that Flynn’s conversations with the Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak were “strictly coincidental” and had nothing to do with the Obama administration’s decision to punish Russia for meddling in the November election, which U.S. intelligence agencies agree was intended to help boost Trump's prospects. “They did not discuss anything having to do with the United States’ decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against Russia,” Pence told CBS. (emphasis mine) And the White House's Press Secretary: Pence wasn’t the only administration official to explain away Flynn’s contact with the Russian envoy. Press Secretary Sean Spicer, then a transition official, said Jan. 13 that Flynn’s calls were about scheduling a call for Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin after the swearing in. “That was it,” Spicer said at the time. “Plain and simple.” (emphasis mine) So, this caused embarrassment for the Trump administration since they misled the public."
Why is COVID-19 prompting such wide scale action versus other infectious diseases?,"The short answer to this question is that 2019-nCoV is new. All the other diseases you mentioned are known quantities: epidemiologists have a good idea how they behave, how they spread, what is likely to happen in a variety of different scenarios, etc. But this disease represents a new mutation that behaves differently from other coronaviruses. It's far more transmissible than other coronaviruses, and worse, seems to be transmissible through casual contact: not intimate contact, blood or fluid exposure, not through an intermediary vector like a tick or flea. Currently the death toll is low, but researchers simply do not have enough data to know whether that trend will continue.  Remember, the death rate of influenza is lower than that of this coronavirus. The 1958 and 1967 influenza pandemics had death rates of about 0.1%, and the 1918 pandemic had a death rate of about 2.5%*. But those pandemics killed millions because they were so transmissible they infected hundreds of millions. If the coronavirus follows that pattern and turns pandemic, we might expect to see any city of a million or so people suffer 20,000 to 30,000 deaths over the course of a couple of months (say 400-500 per day), which is a huge number of people dying by any calculus. Discretion is definitely the better part of valor, here."
What are the arguments in favour of Brexit?,"In decreasing order of certainty: If you work (or intend to work) in a field dealing with border/customs/phytosanitary etc., Brexit may have new job opportunities. If your job/income was somehow threatened by potential immigrants from the EU, it might be less so. If national legislation on environment or other business regulations gets streamlined relative to the EU-inherited one, you might benefit if you're in a business that can take advantage of that streamlining. If you work in a field that the UK government will be more protectionist of (in terms of imports), you might make more money. Something similar for subsidized exports. Those last two or three items are more contingent on no-deal Brexit, in which the UK will be completely unencumbered by EU with any sort of customs union sooner. As you can see I can't envisage unconditional benefits. If you look at the reasons why people voted for Brexit, you'll see that my 3 & 4 are based on that. I'm not sure if ""not sending money to the EU"" (another reason why some voted for Brexit) will translate into any personal financial benefits, given the potential for an economic downturn that might offset any gains from that non-contribution. But one could phrase that as a conditional benefit as well. The elephant in the room is of course how will British economy react (in the short run, since this is focus of the OP's question) to whatever flavor of Brexit passes. Unless you choose to trust the arch-Brexiteers' positive forecasts, the prognostic from more established sources is negative, e.g. Standard & Poors predicted UK recession until 2020 in case of a no-deal Brexit S&P's analysis sees a recession lasting four to five quarters should there be no deal before the exit date on 29 March. It sees the economy shrinking 1.2% in 2019 and 1.5% in 2020, and returning to only moderate growth the following year so that by 2021 economic output would still be 5.5% lower than in the event of an ""orderly exit and transition period"". Of course analysts aren't infaillible. But in this case I haven't heard from a non-politicized body saying UK will shrug it off."
"Is it true that ""Trump did not have a serious opportunity to offer his side of the story"" in the House impeachment proceedings?","The House Judiciary Committee gave The White House the opportunity to present a public defense from either Trump or his lawyers: The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee asked President Trump on Friday whether he intends to mount a defense during the committee’s consideration of impeachment articles, setting a deadline of next Friday for Mr. Trump and his lawyers to decide if they will present evidence or call witnesses. In a letter to the president, Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York and the committee chairman, said Mr. Trump has the right to review the evidence against him, ask questions of his accusers during public hearings that begin next week and present evidence and request witness testimony. “Please provide the committee with notice of whether your counsel intends to participate, specifying which of the privileges your counsel seeks to exercise,” Mr. Nadler wrote. House Judiciary Panel Asks Trump if He Will Present Impeachment Defense However, Trump turned them down, calling the whole process ""unfair"": Calling the impeachment proceedings “completely baseless”, the White House on Friday dismissed a Democratic invitation for Donald Trump to participate in hearings in the House of Representatives, which the president has framed as a partisan escapade. In a letter addressed to the House judiciary committee chairman, Jerry Nadler, the White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, gave no indication that Trump planned to send a lawyer to represent him or attempt to call witnesses. Trump’s non-participation is unprecedented. Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton, the two presidents to face impeachment proceedings in the 20th century, both deployed lawyers and submitted testimony and documents in their defense. White House dismisses invitation to take part in key impeachment hearing The White House also took pains to block testimony by the people who had the most information about his alleged crimes. Central to Trump's defense is the claim that the evidence against him is ""second-hand"" or ""hearsay"", yet the White House officials who could have pointed out errors in this evidence were blocked from testifying by the White House: The former national security adviser [John Bolton] refused to appear for his scheduled deposition Thursday morning, a House Intelligence Committee official said, and his lawyer informed the panel that Bolton would take the House to court if he is subpoenaed. ... “We regret Mr. Bolton’s decision not to appear voluntarily, but we have no interest in allowing the administration to play rope-a-dope with us in the courts for months,” the official said. “Rather, the White House instruction that he not appear will add to the evidence of the president’s obstruction of Congress.” ... The White House has claimed that current and former top presidential advisers, like McGahn and Kupperman, are “absolutely immune” from congressional testimony, and White House lawyers have stepped in to prevent senior officials from complying with requests and subpoenas seeking their testimony. Several of those current and former officials have defied those orders and testified anyway. Bolton is not alone in abiding by the White House’s directives. Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, will also not appear for his scheduled deposition on Friday, according to an administration official. ... Impeachment investigators pressing forward without John Bolton Bolton, Mulvaney, and other officials who were blocked from testifying by the White House were intimately involved in these events, and would have been ideal witnesses in Trump's defense if they had any information that could exonerate him: Bolton and Mulvaney have intimate knowledge of efforts by Trump and his associates to pressure Ukraine to launch public investigations into the president’s political rivals, as well as the decision to withhold critical military aid to Ukraine. Impeachment investigators are examining whether the hold on military aid — in addition to refusing to arrange a White House meeting between Trump and Ukraine’s president — were tied to the investigations sought by Trump. Already, several witnesses have testified that they believed the issues were linked. Impeachment investigators pressing forward without John Bolton"
Why don't poor people vote in the United States?,"They are several reasons at play as to why poor people don't vote. Voter ID laws and registering to vote The Government Accountability Office found in this report, that in most state it costs between $5 - $60 to obtain a vote ID, alternate ID like a passport or driving license also cost money to obtain, and people who don't travel or don't drive may not have needed either before. This may not seem like a huge amount of money but when you're on the breadline every dollar counts. Also another factor is that poorer people are more likely to move home than wealthier people, and that moving home can jeopardize voter eligibility as you have another layer of red tape and paperwork before you can get to the polling station, an MIT study estimated that 1.2 million votes were lost in 2012 due to registration problems alone. Elections are held on working days A lot of poor people are paid by the hour, and if the election is being held on a working day (like in America) you simply can't afford to take the day off. In the 2014 US mid-term elections, a report commissioned by the Pew Research Centre found that 35% of people who didn't vote did so because of scheduling conflicts with work/school. Countries where voting is held on a week-end or public holiday like Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, and Italy typically have higher voter turnouts. A sub-category of this is long lines: in 2016, people sometimes had to wait for hours to cast their ballot. For someone who is losing money for every minute they spend in a line to cast their ballot, having to spend several hours is unappealing at best. Education, education and education (and apathy) Poor people don't have the time to read thousands of pages of news/policies and they don't spend their luncheon reading the Economist. As your article says, policies tend to be tailored towards wealthier constituents, so poorer voters may have difficulty understanding some of the more complex or technical terms used in the political discourse. Another article which claims this is here; poor people don't feel represented so they don't vote. A very blatant example of this was the 2016 Presidential Election where both the major candidates of political parties (Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump) were multi-millionaires/billionaires who had extremely good educations (Yale/Wharton School of Business); these education institutions are often inaccessible to the poor. In fact, almost every single president of the US has at least been some form of millionaire."
Why did the population of Bhutan drop by 70% between 2007 and 2008?,"The article on Bhutan in the English-language Wikipedia has this explanation: The population of Bhutan had been estimated based on the reported figure of about 1 million in the 1970s when the country had joined the United Nations and precise statistics were lacking. Thus, using the annual increase rate of 2–3%, the most population estimates were around 2 million in the year 2000. A national census was carried out in 2005 and it turned out that the population was 672,425. Consequently, United Nations Population Division reduced its estimation of the country's population in the 2006 revision for the whole period from 1950 to 2050. There was no such drastic decline in population, just inaccurate data."
"What makes ""Voter ID laws"" so controversial in the US?","There are many reasons that a voter ID requirement is controversial. This is just a list of some arguments or concerns regarding voter ID laws, there is no attempt to determine the reasonableness of any of them. Elections and identification are two issues that are generally dealt with by states, not the national government. States organize elections. States issue the normal forms of identification in the United States (either a driver's license or another identification). There is a strain of American politics that has a strong fear of the national government. Consider that all Americans do have a national (non-photo) identification in the form of a social security card. This just contains the number we need to access our national social welfare and insurance programs, as well as being a secondary form of ID in many cases. Social security is at the center of many conspiracy theories (for example, this or this).  The idea of a national identification card strikes many of the same fears: an oppressive national government, intrusion into private lives, etc. Many people have reasonable concerns, far from the world of conspiracy theories.  Some people have privacy concerns related to an identification to vote. The idea of an anonymous vote is a part of the American system. A voter ID introduces the idea that voting behavior could be tied to this ID, which would be a significant intrusion into our supposedly-anonymous elections. The Electronics Frontier Foundation published an article summarizing many concerns about elections and privacy. If you wished to know more, I recommend their article.  According to their article, some Americans are shocked to discover that you can access voter registration lists as well as information about who voted when.  Some people are worried that voter ID requirements are either intended to prevent people from voting, or will have the effect of preventing people from voting.  In the last 100 years, racial and economic biases in elections have been an important issue. Although African Americans were legally able to vote as early as 1870, in practice many states or cities had rampant discrimination. There were monetary requirements (which poor Black farmers couldn't afford to pay), literacy tests (which largely uneducated Black citizens couldn't pass), as well as physical violence and manipulation to deter Black voters.  From these experiences, the idea of deterring a group from voting may invoke powerful feelings in many Americans. One group that opposes voter ID requirements (including the national voter ID) is the American Civil Liberties Union. They are concerned, as are many, that these ID laws will lower voter turnout in general, but will disproportionately affect minorities (who are less likely to have identification). Some people are concerned about the possibility of vote fraud, where somebody votes who shouldn't be able to. This is often tied to concerns about immigration, since it seems without an ID requirement immigrants (both legal and illegal) could vote in an American election, which they are not entitled to. This view is espoused in many news articles (example)."
"Do poor people, people of color, and elderly have difficulty in obtaining ID in the US?","Do poor people, people of color, and elderly have difficulty in obtaining ID? For example, here are some facts (citations to supporting authorities are found at this link) (the omission of paragraphs from the source related to subjects not pertinent to the question are not expressly noted in the quoted material below). Anecdotally, I worked with programs involving unemployment, child
support, TANF, SNAP, Medicaid, Medicare and a few others. At no point
in 5 years working with those programs did I hear of ID being an
issue. I know anecdotes are no substitute for data, but I haven't ever
seen this claim supported with any real data. The real data quite overwhelmingly establishes that your anecdotal impressions are inaccurate. 11% of U.S. citizens – or more than 21 million Americans – do not have government-issued photo identification. Note that the source for this statistics clarifies that this is 11% of voting-age American citizens. A demographic breakdown of adult U.S. citizens with and without photo IDs can be found here. It shows that non-whites are much more likely to not have photo ID than whites (even for high income non-whites and non-whites who are not young adults), that not having a photo ID is strongly correlated with having a lower income (especially among whites), that young adults are particularly likely to not have photo ID (especially among whites). Another source has a convenient chart breaking down some key data points:  Even if ID is offered for free, voters must incur numerous costs (such as paying for birth certificates) to apply for a
government-issued ID. Underlying documents required to obtain ID cost
money, a significant expense for lower-income Americans. The combined
cost of document fees, travel expenses and waiting time are estimated
to range from $75 to $175. The economic burden and delay make it difficult for poor people to obtain ID, and this issue empirically, is much bigger than most middle class people intuitively expect as illustrated by the large percentage of adult U.S. citizens who don't have IDs. Young married women whose names have changed are particularly heavily impacted by these costs, and even if one can obtain a suitable ID eventually, it may be challenging to do so in time to vote in the next election (particularly, for example, if you were born and/or married outside the state where you live). The travel required is often a major burden on people with disabilities, the elderly, or those in rural areas without access to a
car or public transportation. In Texas, some people in rural areas
must travel approximately 170 miles to reach the nearest ID office. These factors make it more difficult for elderly and disabled people to obtain IDs. For example, I have a wheelchair dependent client in a major urban area for whom I make house calls as a lawyer, because it takes him four hours roundtrip by bus, and about an hour and a half (at a much higher cost than an Uber or taxi trip) by a specialty wheel chair transportation vehicle that is often not on time for pickups, to travel from his suburban home to my central city office which is near government offices. Nationally, up to 25% of African-American citizens of voting age lack government-issued photo ID, compared to only 8% of whites. The difficulty in obtaining government-photo IDs for African-Americans is strongly suggested by this difference in percentages. Most of the difference is mediated by differences in affluence, including a much higher rate of not owning a motor vehicle, and thus not getting a driver's license (the most common form of photo ID). As evidence from a 2014 court case showed: In May 2014 federal Judge Lynn Adelman found Wisconsin's state photo
ID law unconstitutional given its adverse impact on many Wisconsin
citizens. In his 90-page decision . . . [he notes] that only 47% of
black adults and 43% of Hispanic adults compared to 73% of white
adults in Milwaukee County hold valid driver's licenses as do 85% of
white adults in the rest of Wisconsin compared to 53% of black adults
and 52% of Hispanic adults. Some of this is due to the common discriminatory practice of not locating government offices that provide these services in or near neighborhoods where most African-Americans level, or of understaffing those offices so that delays are longer. An NPR story explores some of the reasons for the differences: I think the first thing to look at is to look at who actually drives.
The most common form of government-issued ID are driver's licenses and
so the people who are most unlikely to drive, as it is, is elderly,
the poor, people who live in big cities, like African-Americans,
especially young people, too, especially if they attend college. They
may not have need for a car at the moment. And then people who are in rural areas. The other challenge for them
is they are not near the Department of Motor Vehicles offices, etc.,
etc. where you would get these IDs. . . . if you're someone trying to get a voter ID, you need that type of
documentation. In order to get an ID, you often need an ID, so it
becomes a Catch 22. MARTIN: And what about - are the states making any provision to help
voters like this who have not previously had IDs... DADE: Yeah. MARTIN: ...to get them? Or are interest groups doing that? DADE: Well, they are. The interest groups are trying to fill in the
void of information, where to get the IDs, what kind of documents you
need to get them when you show up so you're not caught unawares. As far as the states go, they are issuing non-driver voter IDs. Many
of them are for free, but the problem is, when you go to Department of
Motor Vehicle offices, the waits are very long, they're time
consuming. The governor of Tennessee, who's a Republican, by the way -
he has expressed concern about the average wait times there, which
extend well beyond an hour. And if you're talking about thousands of
elderly, in particular, they can't wait that long. A study of Texas voters who tried to vote without photo IDs found some of the following issues came up: Texans offered various reasons why they didn’t have a qualifying ID
for the 2016 general election. Nearly 30 percent said their IDs had
been lost or stolen. About 11.5 percent cited work obligations while
another 4 percent said family obligations prevented them from getting
one. Nearly 36 percent of individuals without IDs checked the “other” box,
many of whom indicated they had moved so their current address didn’t
match what was listed on their IDs. Of those who selected the “other” option, 1.4 percent — 82 people —
cited cost as the reason they didn’t have the appropriate ID. This isn't a representative sample and doesn't include the lion's share of voters without photo IDs who don't try to vote, but it is nonetheless hard data that provides some insight. A meta-analysis of 31 other studies on the topic found some key factors. The main reason people reported for not having identification was that it had been either lost or stolen. Other factors included lack of money for fees, lack of knowledge of application process, lack of competency with bureaucratic forms, the requirement of an address, and the requirements of an existing piece of identification in order to apply for additional identification. For people who are economically marginalized even seemingly minor fees constitute a financial hardship that makes the acquisition of PID prohibitive, and sometimes they are funneled though like of sophistication to commercial fee charging services that facilitate services that the government doesn't charge for or charges much less than the service does for. [F]ees are charged for replacement birth certificates, and if people
go through “third party” providers rather than state agencies to
obtain this form of ID, additional service fees are incurred. This
means that people who have little or no money and who are likely to
lose or have their PID stolen . . . are further burdened with higher
replacement fees. Ultimately, people regularly prioritize the
immediate needs of food, transportation, or rent rather than the costs
of replacing a lost or stolen document. Furthermore, additional costs
are required if individuals must take public transportation or live in
rural or remote locations and have to travel to service centers. Additional Burdens For Proof of Citizenship Also, notably, proof of citizenship is much more challenging to marshal (usually requiring a birth certificate that many people are not currently in possession of, marriage certificates to document change of name, naturalization certificates, and/or passports), then the proof of identity needed for a photo-ID without citizenship verification such as driver's licenses or state IDs that do not require proof of citizenship: A federal district court that heard a challenge to the Kansas law
noted that “the sheer number” of people blocked “evidences the
difficulty of complying with the law as it is currently enforced.” The
court found that more than 18,000 people who tried to register at the
state’s motor vehicle offices were prevented from registering between
2013 and 2016 “as a direct result” of the state’s documentary proof of
citizenship requirement. This is because getting a birth certificate and linking it to your identity, or having a passport, can be cumbersome taking time, money and even legal assistance. A story from the Washington Post puts flesh on the bones of the raw statistics and illustrates in personal and compelling examples, how these factors play out in the lives of individual people without photo IDs. One such story is this one from Texas: Many of the residents struggling to obtain a valid photo ID are
elderly and poor and were born in homes rather than hospitals. As a
result, birth certificates were often lost or names were misspelled in
official city records. Hargie Randall, 72, was born in his family’s home in Huntsville, Tex.,
and has lived in the state his entire life. Randall, now living in
Houston’s low-income Fifth Ward neighborhood, has several health
problems and such poor eyesight that he is legally blind. He can’t
drive and has to ask others for rides. After Texas implemented its new law, Randall went to the Department of
Public Safety (the Texas agency that handles driver’s licenses and
identification cards) three times to try to get a photo ID to vote.
Each time Randall was told he needed different items. First, he was
told he needed three forms of identification. He came back and brought
his Medicaid card, bills and a current voter registration card from
voting in past elections. “I thought that because I was on record for voting, I could vote
again,” Randall said. But he was told he still needed more documentation, such as a
certified copy of his birth certificate. Records of births before 1950, such as Randall’s, are not on a central
computer and are located only in the county clerk’s office where the
person was born. For Randall, that meant an hour-long drive to Huntsville, where his
lawyers found a copy of his birth certificate. But that wasn’t enough. With his birth certificate in hand, Randall
went to the DPS office in Houston with all the necessary documents.
But, DPS officials still would not issue him a photo ID because of a
clerical mistake on his birth certificate. One letter was off in his
last name — “Randell” instead of “Randall” — so his last name was
spelled slightly different than on all his other documents. Kamin, the lawyer, asked the DPS official if they could pull up
Randall’s prior driver’s-license information, as he once had a
state-issued ID. The official told her that the state doesn’t keep
records of prior identification after five years, and there was
nothing they could do to pull up that information. Kamin was finally able to prove to a DPS supervisor that there was a
clerical error and was able to verify Randall’s identity by showing
other documents. Is Lack Of A Photo ID Indicative Of Being Ineligible To Vote? It also bears noting, while slightly off the narrow scope of the question, that the likelihood that an African-American who speaks English with an American accent (a group that makes up the vast majority, probably 98% or more of African-Americans who do not have IDs in all but a handful of counties in the United States) not being a U.S. citizen is vanishingly small. Put another way, virtually all of the 25% of African-Americans adults without IDs in the United States are U.S. citizens who are eligible to vote (absent felony disqualification which is present mostly in states that also impose other barriers to voting like voter ID laws and also have a long history of racial discrimination). The share of African, Afro-Caribbean, and black Latin American legal immigration to the U.S. is modest, many of those immigrants are naturalized citizens, and those immigrants overwhelmingly have passports. About 6-7% of undocumented immigrants in the United States are black (see here and here) and those undocumented immigrants are overwhelming recent immigrants. Voters not infrequently have some form of ID but not one of the forms of ID required by Voter ID laws. The types of IDs allowed are tailored to political demographics: States exclude forms of ID in a discriminatory manner. Texas allows concealed weapons permits for voting, but does not accept student ID
cards. Until its voter ID law was struck down, North Carolina
prohibited public assistance IDs and state employee ID cards, which
are disproportionately held by Black voters. And until recently,
Wisconsin permitted active duty military ID cards, but prohibited
Veterans Affairs ID cards for voting. One particularly notorious case involves South Dakota's unwillingness to accept Indian tribe IDs, an especially big factor for people who live on Indian reservations that are remote from non-tribal government offices, who are often poor, and are a group of people that almost by definition is made up 100% of U.S. citizens. Selected Sources The sources for the fact cited above include the Brennan Center Brennan Center for Justice, Citizens without Proof: A Survey of Americans’ Possession of Documentary Proof of Citizenship and Photo Identification (New York: Brennan Center for Justice, 2006), a report from the federal government's General Accountability Office (GAO), a published academic journal article with three University of California at San Diego professors as authors, and a Harvard law professor's published academic article, Richard Sobel, The High Cost of ‘Free’ Photo Voter Identification Cards (Cambridge: Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race and Justice at Harvard Law School, 2014)."
What challenges remain for online voting?,"There are two challenges to online voting which can be seen as well technological as cultural. Challenge 1:
You cannot at the same time have verifiability of an election and anonymous voting. This implies that you have to make a tradeoff between an anonymous election (as it is the case with paper ballots) and verifiability. If you want to be sure that each and every vote is counted, you have to identify every voter and provide him with a method to verify that his vote has been counted correctly. In order to do that you need to link voter to vote which would make an anonymous vote impossible. There are cultures (in working democracies) where public voting is common, so this is mostly a cultural question on how you see voting in those cultures. Nonetheless is there a risk, if a non-functioning democracy would implement a identity-linked voting system, that the regime could after the election prosecute the defectors. Challenge 2
Accessibility has to be always guaranteed While the penetration of modern technology has advanced, the knowledge on how to use it has not advanced at the same pace. In order for e-Voting to work (given Challenge 1 resolved) you would need to have people IT-literate enough to use a government-issued certificate to authenticate themselves and be able in general to use computers. This challenge will automatically be resolved over time, but at the moment, especially in ageing societies of the western hemisphere this is not a given fact."
What are Trump's incentives for withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement?,"Culture. In the US denial of climate science has been turned into part of the 'culture wars'. As such it is part of identity of many on the political right to decry global warming as a left-wing invention made up for political ends. Any effect on reality, jobs or international relations is secondary. And it seems that unlike many things, like repealing the ACA, Trump can actually do this; he can withdraw from Paris, keeping his voters happy and without any immediate negative effects; it's totemic more than anything. Edit.. Since people seem (wrongly) to think that there is any more to it than this, I can first present the actual agreement. In which there is no enforcement mechanism or sanctions. You just pick a NDC (nationally determined contributions) and promise to stick to it; if you don't there are no consequences, apart from those to the environment. It follows that any costs associated with the agreement are voluntary, and any argument based on costs is void. No one got hauled over the coals (sic.) for missing Kyoto targets, no one will be strung up for missing Paris targets. Is global warming now firmly part of the culture wars? Yes, it is - this is independent of any actual reality. Political affiliation is embarrassingly strongly tied to acceptance of the science. So Trump is just following this.  And we British have our own. James Delingpole, Matt Ridley, and Christopher Monkton all have their contributions. So yes, this is all happening for cultural reasons, and dumping the Paris agreement has no real-world consequences - if it had such consequences it would have had to get through the US senate. I'd also note that this argument would be exactly the same if all the science behind global warming was concocted - that simply doesn't come in to it."
Is the proposal to create a US Space Force being taken seriously?,"The administration is taking it seriously, but so far has had trouble getting the funds for it as well as fully convincing the Pentagon that a 6th force, separate from the Air Force, is really needed. The motivating enemy is apparently... In 2007, China blew up a dead weather satellite with a missile, creating a massive debris cloud in orbit, which Pence called ""a highly provocative demonstration of China's growing capability to militarize space"". As for the infighting and funding... But the monumental task of standing up a new military department, which would require approval by a Congress that shelved the idea last year, may require significant new spending and a reorganization of the largest bureaucracy in the world. And the idea has already run into fierce opposition inside and outside the Pentagon, particularly from the Air Force, which could lose some of its responsibilities. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis last year said he opposed a new department of the military ""at a time when we are focused on reducing overhead and integrating joint warfighting functions."" This week [of Aug 10], Mattis said the Pentagon and the White House ""are in complete alignment"" on the need to view space as a warfighting domain. But he stopped short of endorsing a full-fledged Space Force. [...] The White House intends to work with lawmakers to introduce legislation by early next year, a senior administration official said, with the hope of standing up the first new military department since the Air Force was formed in 1947. [...] Some members of Congress advocated last year for creating a Space Corps in the Air Force Department, similar to how the Marine Corps is part of the Navy Department. Elevating the proposal to create a new department will mean additional Pentagon bureaucracy, critics say. [...] Before Trump's announcement in June that he wanted a Space Force, Mattis and Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson had cautioned against creating new Pentagon bureaucracy to address space issues. James said she thinks they're now ""stuck because the president announced this by surprise."" Gen. David L. Goldfein, the Air Force's top officer, and Gen. Stephen Wilson, the vice chief, sat quietly in the Pentagon auditorium as Pence spoke. Air Force Gen. Paul Selva, the Pentagon's vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in a briefing with reporters that the Pentagon is very much in favor of establishing a Space Command as a way to speed up efforts in space. But when it comes to establishing a new branch of the military, Selva said, ""there's an obligation"" to present a set of options that can be presented to Congress."
What is the most someone can lose the popular vote by but still win the electoral college?,"I don't know the exact number but, as a proportion of the votes cast, it's essentially 100%. Here's how to calculate it. Find the set of states with the largest population of possible voters but no more than 268 electoral college votes. In all of those states, let candidate A win 100% of the vote, with 100% turnout. In every other state, have just one person vote, and have that person vote for candidate B. This gives candidate A approximately 62,500,000 votes (assuming your electorate of 125M* and that A's states are about half the population) and candidate B gets at most 50 votes. So, in this admittedly highly contrived scenario, B wins the electoral college with something in the ballpark of 0.0001% of the popular vote. Note that a tied electoral college allows an even lower proportion of the popular vote since the House could choose resolve the tie in favour of the third-place candidate.  That candidate could, in principle, have won a single state by getting the only vote that was cast there, and not got any other votes in the rest of the country. * It seems that the actual number of people who are eligible to vote is around 232 million though, of course, many of them don't vote at all."
How does a shutdown end if an agreement is never reached?,"If necessary, Congress can pass a spending bill without the president's support. Currently Trump claims he will veto any bill which doesn't include funding for the wall. However if two-thirds of each chamber of Congress agree, they can override a presidential veto and end the shutdown. The current Senate has already passed a spending bill without funding for Trump's wall once with a veto-proof majority of 100-0. Instead of voting on that bill though, the Republican-lead House of Representatives voted on a different bill with wall funding that was sure to fail in the Senate. The Senate won't change much in the next Congress, but the House of Representatives will have new leadership and can try to pass a similar bill to what has previously passed the Senate. If the Senate votes similarly and the House gets enough votes they can end the shutdown with or without Trump."
"Why is there a need to prevent a racist, sexist, or otherwise bigoted vendor from discriminating who they sell to?","TL;DR: You question rests in the supposition that, next to the business that refuses to sell to me, there will be another similar business that will be willing to sell to me. That supposition is, to put it mildly, optimistic, and you ignore historical examples of institutionalized/collective racism that disprove it. You take the POV of an individual discriminatory business owner in an overall non-discriminatory environment without taking into account other competence limiting factors. But maybe I live at a small town that is served by two pharmacies, and -since racism is often a social convention- both pharmacy owners forbid me from buying medicines. Maybe I have no car or other transport means1 to use it to access another town with pharmacies easily enough (in the case that those pharmacies are not owned by racists, too). And of course, being it an small town and my race being a minority2, the market would not be big enough to support a third pharmacy3 to compete with the already established ones. 1Or, we go back in time enough, simply there were no cars or other ways of transportation enough that would make travelling to the big city an easy activity. 2And probably not a rich minority. 3And that ignores possible barriers put forward by a racist mayor/council/public... again, do not think only of individual racism but of a racist community. If my race is 5% of the population and none of the remaining 95% will shop at a pharmacy that sells to me, it would be very difficult for such pharmacy to be profitable."
What does the US have to gain by other countries not being socialist or communist?,"If we extrapolate from the historical record, it looks like the U.S. couldn't care less if there is a dictatorship or not in Venezuela or anywhere else. What the U.S. seems to care about strongly is that a regime does not intrude on their trade interests. Communist and socialist regimes have a tendency to nationalize industries and push land reform, thereby ousting the current stakeholders, which might be U.S. companies. (Land reform usually  redistributes land from large landowners to peasants; e.g. see the Guatemalan land reform of 1952.) Therefore the U.S. likes to support right-wing regimes and military juntas aligned with the current business elites. Most talk about capitalism vs. communism, human rights, democracy etc. is just a pretext to justify military intervention to install a regime that is friendly to U.S. interests. I agree that the situation in Venezuela is a humanitarian catastrophe and I strongly oppose dictators and autocrats. But sadly, it looks like the U.S. is mainly interested in the Venezuelan oil reserves. [1][2] Here are two observations to support this argument: There are many dictatorships currently allied with the U.S.: List of authoritarian regimes supported by the United States. The people under these regimes face many hardships and human rights abuses. Why does the U.S. not intervene? There are many historical examples where the U.S. has helped to overthrow democratically elected governments to further their economic interests (or of U.S. based corporations): 1949 Syrian coup d'état 1952 Cuban military coup 1953 Iranian coup d'état 1954 Guatemalan coup d'état 1961 Democratic Republic of the Congo 1964 Brazilian coup d'état 1965 Dominican Republic 1973 Chilean coup d'état 1985 Nicaragua (I give no examples after the end of the Cold War because the targeted regimes like Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria etc. were not democratic.)

"What, if any, are the benefits of tying health insurance to employment (as in the US) over other systems?","First, let's be clear: employers do not offer benefits like health insurance naturally. If we go back to the early stages of industrialization, employers merely offered salaries (often paltry salaries, at that). Benefits — as the name implies — came into play later; they were meant as incentives to hire and retain engineers, high-level management, or highly skilled workers, all of whom were in short supply and high demand as industries expanded and diversified. Benefits only extended to low level workers as the result of union activity, either as a direct result of collective bargaining or an indirect result where employers offered benefits to keep workers from unionizing. Benefits, from the employer's perspective, are merely a cost/benefit issue: the minimum expenditure required to prevent greater losses from employee attrition or further union activity. The US has always been a capitalist, corporatist nation. US institutions are geared to preserve the health and well-being of corporations, not the health and well-being of employees, and in those contexts where it does not explicitly forbid unionization or collective action, it does not interfere with corporate efforts to minimize the impact of such activities. The reason employers prefer this 'benefits' scenario is that it keeps payouts entirely within the corporate cost-accounting system. The corporation decides how much it is going to commit to employee benefits; the corporation chooses benefits plans that best fit its own profit maximization; the corporation can (as necessary) fire employees, change benefits, alter payouts, move money around, or otherwise control the way the benefits are handled. The more that benefits are shifted off to the government — through things like minimum wage guarantees, public health options, guaranteed leaves, etc — the more that money for these benefits leaves corporate control. Public health options, for instance, mean that employers cannot minimize their costs by seeking out cheap plans, cannot preclude payments for expensive procedures of ongoing medical issues, and are ultimately responsible for the health of the entire populace, not merely the limited and controllable population of current employees. The problem isn't even necessarily that their tax burden will increase (though that is a fear); the problem is that money paid into taxes for public benefits is money they lose control of, and cannot manipulate to increase their profit margin. Of course, this leaves us in the unenviable position we are in now, in which we effectively have to bribe employers with public funds so that they don't fire employees en masse, costing people their livelihoods and health coverage in the middle of a pandemic. But that's life in a corporatist state..."
"Why aren't Americans simply called ""Americans""?","""...people in the USA like dividing themselves up into groups..."" Not everybody in the US likes this or does this. Despite my heritage (there are many hyphenated identities I could apply), I am simply an American.  There is a tendency, often seen in the news media and liberal interest groups, to categorize people into ethnic, racial, religious, gender-based or other sub-groups. However, many Americans reject this collectivist approach to identity, preferring instead to focus on the importance of each individual. So I would disagree with the premise of your question. Only some people in the US use hyphenated American identities. Others are proud to be simply American. As to the reasons why people use these terms, they vary wildly. In the early 20th century, referring to people as ""German-American"" or ""Irish-American"" was often meant to offend. In current day political campaigns, the terms ""African-American"", ""Hispanic-American"" and ""Asian-American"" are used to categorize electoral blocks. Ethnic pride is another reason. There are countless others."
Why was the Economist model so sure Trump was going to lose compared to other models?,"In comparison to the 538 model,  the economist model uses less ""fat tails"". 538 uses a t-distribution to account for ""black swan"" events: things that, although they are unlikely, would have a big impact on the polls.  This means that 538 assigns a small probability to some very unlikely outcomes (Trump wins California, or Biden wins Utah)  The Economist model doesn't. It uses a normal distribution which has thinner tails, and so treats these kind of results as essentially impossible.  Moreover the 538 model uses data back to 1936 to try to estimate how much polls can change between now and the Election. The Economist uses only more recent data. The effect of these modelling assumptions is to make extreme events more likely.  For Trump to win now would require either a very significant failure in polling or a large swing in several states.  The economist model essentially says ""A swing like that has never happened, so I'll assume it won't""  This results in about 95% chance for Biden.  The 538 model says ""Very large swings have occurred, if you look back to (for example) Truman v. Dewey.  And sometimes something might happen that will completely change the course of the election (War was declared or a major scandal) and comes up with about 88% for Biden. The change from a few weeks ago to now is that Trump is running out of time to make a big change.  Both models were set to wait till after the debate, to see if it could make a change. It didn't (much).  The assumption is that the gap will narrow as you get towards polling day.  But this narrowing hasn't happened.  This leads to greater confidence in a Biden win. The difference is 538's ""fat tails""."
Is there a difference between how Cambridge Analytica and the Obama Campaign got Facebook users' data?,"did both sides basically do the same thing (using data without the users consent) No, according to your link The people signing up for [""Obama for America""] knew the data they were handing over would be used to support a political campaign. The way the data was used was different What is true is that, in both cases, friends of users were not explicitly asked by Facebook or by anyone else for consent for their data to be used in this way. Facebook seems to have taken the view that if you choose to share data with a friend, that friend is free to share that data further. Facebook's history suggests that their meat-based products are often unaware of or oblivious to the sausage-factory's sales to their real customers. † The Trump campaign are reported as saying the data obtained by CA (in contravention of Facebook policies‡) was not actually used because the RNC had some better data they could use for the purpose. ‡ Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook CEO, says the data was passed to CA in contravention of Facebook's policies at that time. I would like to make one thing clear as far as I understand it. Both camps started by getting user data from users who willingly used [their respective] app. That is not the case. There was no ""Trump for America"" app. Facebook users did not willingly use a Trump campaign app. They thought they were using a Cambridge university personality test. NPR reports Betsy Hoover, the online organizing director for Barack Obama's 2012 presidential campaign as saying: the app that everyone's referring to in this moment was an app called Targeted Sharing. It was an app that we created on Facebook that fully followed Facebook's terms of service. And any individual could decide to use the app. When they clicked on the app, a screen would pop up that would say what data they're authorizing the app was giving us access to and exactly how we were going to use that data. And so at that time, it was totally legitimate on Facebook to say you're giving us access to your social network. You're giving us access to your friends on Facebook. we matched the data of your friends to that model and then reflected it back to the person who had authorized the app and said, if you want to reach out to your friends about this election on Facebook, here are the ones that you should reach out to first. And that was it... Users of the ""Obama for America"" app provided access to information about their friends explicitly in order to find out which ones would be receptive to messages from the user regarding the political campaign those users were supporting. USA Today reports
Patrick Ruffini, a co-founder Echelon Insights, a Republican-leaning digital analytics and research firm, as saying: had Cambridge Analytica just put out the app themselves, they would have been playing by the rules Obama's team put out the app themselves, Trump's did not. A republican says Trump's team were not ""playing by the rules"". Related"
Can a person refuse a presidential pardon?,"It is possible to reject a pardon.  Referring to United States v. Wilson: There is nothing peculiar in a pardon which ought to distinguish it in
  this respect from other facts; no legal principle known to the court
  will sustain such a distinction. A pardon is a deed to the validity of
  which delivery is essential, and delivery is not complete without
  acceptance. It may then be rejected by the person to whom it is
  tendered, and if it be rejected, we have discovered no power in a
  court to force it on him. There are also other practical effects to accepting pardons, such as waiving of fifth amendment rights relating to the pardoned crimes, since it would be impossible to self incriminate anymore.  So there are reasons to refuse beyond ""choosing to go to prison""."
Could the UK re-join EU after leaving?,"Article 50 of the Treaties of the European Union (the article which governs leaving the EU) has a clause which explicitly mentions that rejoining the EU is possible after leaving it: Article 49, in case you wonder, is the general admission process which applies to all would-be new EU members. It requires unanimous consent from the EU council members and simple majority from the EU parliament. That means any EU member could veto the UKs re-admission, but currently I wouldn't know of any EU state having a good reason to do so. So you can dismiss the statement ""UK will never be able to rejoin the EU"" as FUD. You can of course consider the political problems of re-joining the EU after a referendum just came to the conclusion that the UK population does not want to be a part of the EU. While referendums in the UK are non-binding due to parliamental sovereignty it would theoretically be possible to act against it. But doing so might be considered political suicide. It will likely take a new referendum to rejoin the EU, and until circumstances have considerably changed there will likely be harsh resistance against another one. On the other hand, there are also all the special privileges the UK used to have in the EU, like opting out of the Schengen agreement, opting out of the Euro zone, a rebate on financial contributions to the EU and many more. All of that would need to be renegotiated in case of a readmission. So while it is wrong to say ""The UK can not rejoin the EU"", one might say that ""The UK can not rejoin the EU and regain all the special privileges it had""."
Can members of the US Congress lie during debate without penalty?,"Generally speaking, anything that a member of Congress says during a speech or debate in Congress is protected by the U.S. Constitution from lawsuits and criminal prosecution. This immunity is covered in Article I, Section 6, and is known as the ""Speech and Debate Clause"". The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for
  their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury
  of the United States. They shall in all Cases, except Treason, Felony
  and Breach of the Peace, be privileged from Arrest during their
  Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses, and in going to
  and returning from the same; and for any Speech or Debate in either
  House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place. (emphasis mine) So a member of Congress can't go to jail for lying during a debate in Congress. However, the Constitution does say: ""...shall not be questioned in any other Place."" I read this to mean that a member of Congress can be punished (e.g. with expulsion) by his/her peers. The U.S. Supreme Court dove into this matter in Powell v. McCormack (1969). There is substantial case law elaborating on the Speech and Debate Clause. For example, in addition to the case noted above, Gravel v United States (1972) was another landmark case. It established that the clause's protections can, under certain circumstances, apply to Congressional staffers. More cases are listed below. A useful and detailed commentary of the clause can be found in this document provided by Congress.gov (pdf; the relevant section starts at page 137). Here are some excerpts: The immunities of the Speech or Debate Clause were not written into the Constitution simply for the personal or private benefit of Members of Congress, but to protect the integrity of the legislative process by insuring the
  independence of individual legislators. The protection of this clause is not limited to words spoken in
  debate. Committee reports, resolutions, and the act of voting are
  equally covered, as are things generally done in a session of the
  House by one of its members in relation to the business before it. So long as legislators are acting in the sphere of legitimate
  legislative activity, they are protected not only from the consequence
  of litigation's results but also from the burden of defending themselves. The scope of the meaning of ""legislative activity"" has its limits. The heart of the clause is speech or debate in either House, and insofar as the clause is construed to reach other matters, they must be an integral part of the deliberative and communicative processes by which Members participate in committee and House proceedings with respect to the consideration and passage
  or rejection of proposed legislation or with respect to other matters
  which the Constitution places within the jurisdiction of either
  House. Immunity from civil suit, both in law and equity, and from criminal action based on the performance of legislative duties flows from a determination that a challenged act is within the definition of legislative activity, but the Court in the more recent cases appears to have narrowed the concept somewhat. Legal cases: Also, outside the Constitution, there's the Westfall Act (2007), a federal statute that ""accords federal employees absolute immunity from tort claims arising out of acts undertaken in the course of their official duties"". The statute was litigated in Wuterich v. Murtha (2009)."
Why am I being asked to vote?,"There are two possible interpretations here, the cynical and the optimistic. Note that I am not naming any specific parties and for the purposes of this answer am not taking any side. The cynical: After looking at the demographics as they apply to you particularly, they've calculated a high chance that if you were to vote you would vote for them, therefore they're trying to encourage you -- and as many others in a similar demographic as they can -- to vote. After all, who wins the election ultimately depends on how many people actually went out and voted for a particular candidate, not just on how many people sided with them or agreed with their position. The idealistic: The whole point of living in a representative democracy (or a republic if you're going to insist on semantics) is that the government reflects and represents the will of the people as best it can. Which means that the more people vote, the better the system works. And if you honestly believe that you're in the right, and that the majority of people will side with you, encouraging absolutely everyone to vote is no more than the right thing to do. I personally prefer to live in a world where the idealistic answer is correct. So go out and vote. EDIT Jontia put it better than I did in their answer."
Why does the US not just accept North Korea's nuclear ambitions and attempt to mend relationships?,"From the USA point of view there are two types of arguments. The first ones are those that state that the fewer nuclear capable countries there are, the better1: Fewer nuclear warheads at risk of being captured/sold to rogue actors. Non-nuclear countries are less of a worry if they become unstable. Every foreign country, no matter how friendly, is at the least a competitor. And countries that currently side with you may change their stance in the future. The less leverage other countries have, the better. For example, once WWII ended the USA stopped helping the development of UK nuclear weapons. The second part are the reasons for which North Korea may be viewed as a specially worrysome nuclear power are: It is certainly not friendly to the USA. It is technically in a state of war with one of USA's allies, and occasionally acts aggressively against it (including exchanging artillery fire). It has publicly conducted illegal actions in other countries2 (kidnapped Japanese citizens, murder of Kim Jong Nam). It is a totalitarian regime, which means fewer controls preventing a single individual deciding to use the nuclear weapons. It has little foreign contact, which means both less leverage against it (has no foreign trade to lose if an embargo is placed) and less knowledge of its internal politics (what things are they interested in and which things they see as threatening). The North Korean weapon program is in breach of previous pacts to which the USA was party to. Additionally, internally it is very hard to sell to the public that the USA cannot impose its will in a tiny, backwards country in the Far East and that it has to begin talks without being able to dictate the terms. Politicians court the public favour by the use of grandstanding claims (""Our mighty army! The USA are an exceptional case!"") which do not mix well with realpolitik. 
1And yes, you can claim that it is hypocritical for one of the nuclear superpowers to have this aim. Others can claim that, while this approach benefits the USA, it also benefits the rest of the world. We are looking at the reasons from the USA point of view. 2Here again, the USA has done that, too. Did I tell you that these were the reasons from the USA point of view?"
Why was President Trump heavily criticized for congratulating Putin on winning the election?,"After the Crimea annexation, the social media trolling during the US election and the recent Skripal incident, the public image of the Russian government in the western world turned from bad to worse. So the comparison between Putin 2018, Putin 2012 and Medvedev 2008 is not necessarily appropriate. Trump is under suspicion of colluding with the Russian government to gain an advantage during his presidential election, so any interaction between him and Russia is currently subject to intense scrutiny. This makes the ""Trump congratulates Putin for getting reelected"" story a good angle for Trump's political opponents to attack him."
How did the Kavanaugh confirmation move so quickly despite the serious allegations?,"The situation is fairly complex so I'm not surprised it was confusing. Here's the general rundown (partially pulled from this article for brevity) How did this just get fast tracked? Where is the politics in the middle? It wasn't fast tracked. The process was nearly done (almost 2 months of interviews, investigations and meetings with Kavanaugh) when the allegations leaked. The problem for Kavanaugh opponents generally came down to"
What is the rationale behind Angela Merkel's criticism of Donald Trump's ban on Twitter?,"While Germany does promote free speech, same as the USA does, their free speech means something different: False information is not an object worthy of protection from the
viewpoint of freedom of opinion (54 BVerfGE 208, 219). The deliberate
assertion of untrue facts is not protected by article 5, paragraph 1
of the Basic Law; Merkel did not say Trump should be allowed to spread his messages - the kind of speech Trump disseminated on Twitter would have landed him in court many times in Germany. Instead, in Germany it's seen as problematic when a private company decides what speech is and is not deemed acceptable, because that's a matter to be fairly decided by laws and courts*. Twitter is an international company that does have a presence in Germany, so I interpret Merkel's statement as ""don't try to pull that kind of stuff over here"". *Reality is more complicated and counter-examples do exist. Yet in general in Germany the state is far more aggressive in limiting offensive/dangerous speech, and also more protective of citizens' online rights. **The controversial German Network Enforcement Act from 2017 (NetzDG) demonstrates the massive difference between the German and the US approach. It doesn't simply give private companies powers to decide what speech is and isn't acceptable, it legally requires private companies to make judgments about what speech is and isn't acceptable, provides regulation for how they must go about deletions, bans, and preservations of evidence, and demands transparent published rules. The private company still decides, but it's a power that is deputized to the company by the state, with limits, boundaries and oversight. Please don't ask me which approach is better, because I have no idea."
Are there any major left-wing conspiracy theories in the USA?,"Yes, there are plenty of conspiracy theories that are primarily supported by left-wing voters and politicians.  Here are a few examples (not meant to be an exhaustive list): Conspiracy theories about HIV/AIDS are popular in many left-leaning demographics in the US, especially black and Hispanic Americans.  According to one survey, ""approximately 55% of Latinos and 50% of African Americans reported believing that the government secretly had an HIV vaccine.""  Furthermore, as of 2006, around a fifth of white Americans and over a quarter of African-Americans believed that ""AIDS is an agent of genocide created by the US government to kill off minority populations."" There are legitimate reasons that many black people distrust the US medical establishment, but this still counts as a conspiracy theory. As of 2007, about 35% of Democrats reported believing that George W. Bush knew about the 9/11 terrorist attacks in advance. Conspiracy theories about election fraud are widespread among members of both major US political parties.  A 2018 poll found that as many as 66% of Democrats believed that ""Russia tampered with vote tallies in order to get Donald Trump elected president.""  Likewise, in 2013, about 37% of surveyed Democrats said they believed that ""President Bush's supporters committed significant voter fraud in order to win Ohio in 2004."" Conspiracy theories about GMO's (genetically modified organisms) began as mostly a left-wing phenomenon.  However, the gap has narrowed over the years.  For example, US Democrats and Republicans are now almost equally likely to believe that GM foods are unsafe. For many years, a reasonably popular left-wing conspiracy theory claimed that the US and its allies were spying on ordinary citizens' private communications on an unimaginable, global scale.  Not all conspiracy theories turn out to be false."
What reasons are there for a Capitalist to oppose a 100% inheritance tax?,"I would recommend watching Milton Friedman's ""Free To Choose"" series for a deeper discussion of these issues."
Why is there no process in the United States to remove and re-elect the President?,"One of the main reasons was that the President - even now, never mind in Founding Fathers' time - is not the ""head of government"", the way Prime Ministers are in Parliamentary systems. The President is the head of Executive Branch of government, and in Founders' time that branch had fairly little power, therefore there was far less possible impact and importance to having a re-election. 200+ years ago, most of the domestic power was in the hands of legislative branch (Congress). There's too many references to pick just one, just go with whichever level of scholarniness you prefer out of a Google search for ""us growth of presidential power"".  Also important is the fact that - again, as of Founder's time, the removal process outcome would NOT be the same as today. Today, the Vice President is a member of President's party (after 12th Amendment to the Constitution was ratified), so removing him without a subsequent election would (theoretically) have relatively little effect in terms of politics/policy.  Back then, the Vice President would be the second placed person in Presidential election, and the Founders very strongly frowned on the whole idea of ""factions"" (as they called what we know as parties). As such, removing a President - via impeachment, or health reasons - would likely result in the same net effect as a re-election, as last election's runner-up would probably win, and that person is ALREADY a Vice President who would succeed the president."
Why is privacy a subject felt more in Europe rather than the US?,"Several EU states endured surveillance by secret police in the past (for instance in Nazi Germany or Eastern Germany), making privacy a sensitive enough topic that constituents demanded strict protection from future large-scale surveillance attempts. In complying with these requests, law makers also ensured that it wouldn't be possible for a State to work around these rules by resorting to the private sector. It was then a natural step to enshrine privacy protection at the EU level. Another factor that feeds into the attitude is that Europeans have an example across the Atlantic of how things can go wrong when there's very little privacy protection. Put bluntly, it's not appealing. The US, by contrast, never experienced an oppressive secret police - however close the FBI might have come to that description under Hoover. There are some provisions and laws at both the State and Federal levels aimed at guaranteeing privacy, and some legal chatter about it every now and then, but nothing firmly set in stone (except for medical data, and prohibition from spying on US citizens that has been progressively diluted - or indeed, ignored - since 9/11). Edward Snowden exposed US government operated large scale surveillance activities, which has heightened public awareness about the issue. But these have never reached the point where there are widespread fears about the police showing up at your doorstep, arresting you, and abusively keeping you locked up or worse for arbitrary reasons. Nor has that point been reached by neighboring states or while under occupation by an enemy force. So things progress slowly."
Is the US unusually prone to walking away from signed treaties/accords?,"I only have an indirect argument: Bilateral treaties get unilaterally exited more often than multilateral treaties do cf. Helfer (2005) ""Exiting Treaties"": Not surprisingly, there have been far more ratifications of treaties (32,021) than denunciations and withdrawals (1547) since 1945. [...] of the 5416 multilateral agreements concluded after 1945, 191, or 3.5%, have been denounced at least once. In light of the 1547 denunciations filed during this same sixty year period, this small percentage suggests that a few multilateral agreements have been denounced by multiple states.  As a consequence, it is likely (but not certain) that the US unilaterally exited more treaties than an ""average"" country, not just in absolute number but also as a proportion of treaties entered. If someone else can find a direct analysis... by all means, that would be a better answer. Clearly a database exist (with per country data) and was used by Helfer, but it doesn't seem to be public. Barely quantitatively, Helfer's paper only says about the US aggregate behavior: The unilateralist behavior of the United States provides a salient
  example. The United States has recently refrained from ratifying—
  or has withdrawn from—numerous multilateral agreements that
  are widely ratified by other nations and that it at one time championed.
  These treaties include the Kyoto Protocol, the Rome Statute
  establishing the International Criminal Court, the Landmines Convention, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, the Convention
  on Biological Diversity, International Covenant on Economic,
  Social and Cultural Rights, the United Nations Convention on the
  Law of the Sea, and, most recently, the Framework Convention for
  Tobacco Control and the Optional Protocol to the Vienna Convention
  on Consular Relations. By remaining outside these treaties
  through non-entry or exit, the United States has, according to
  many observers, cast doubt on its commitment to multilateral cooperation. And an important comment on another answer, which might get missed (because there are so many comments under it): regarding the US Constitution Treaty Clause:  The body of law governing U.S. foreign policy recognizes three mechanisms by which the United States enters into binding international obligations. The term ""treaty"" is used in a more restricted legal sense [in the US] than in international law. U.S. law distinguishes what it calls treaties from congressional-executive agreements and executive agreements. All three classes are considered treaties under international law; they are distinct only from the perspective of internal United States law. Distinctions among the three concern their method of ratification: by two-thirds of the Senate, by normal legislative process, or by the President alone, respectively. The Treaty Clause empowers the President to make or enter into treaties with the ""advice and consent"" of two-thirds of the Senate. In contrast, normal legislation becomes law after approval by simple majorities in both the Senate and the House of Representatives and the signature of the President. And from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_agreement  In the United States, executive agreements are binding internationally if they are negotiated and entered into under the president's authority in foreign policy, as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, or from a prior act of Congress. For instance, as commander-in-chief the President negotiates and enters into status of forces agreements (SOFAs), which govern the treatment and disposition of U.S. forces stationed in other nations. The president cannot, however, enter unilaterally into executive agreements on matters that are beyond his constitutional authority. In such instances, an agreement would need to be in the form of a congressional-executive agreement, or a treaty with Senate advice and consent. The U.S. Supreme Court, in United States v. Pink (1942), held that international executive agreements validly made have the same legal status as treaties and did not require Senate approval.  And Pink has been reaffirmed more recently in Dames & Moore v. Regan: More recently, in Dames & Moore v. Regan, the Court
  relied upon, inter alia, the Pink case to sustain President Carter’s
  suspension of claims pending in American courts against Iran as
  required by the Hostage Release Agreement of 1981, supra, and,
  more directly, by Executive order. In light of Pink, the Court indicated
  that ‘‘prior cases * * * have recognized that the President
  does have some measure of power to enter into executive agreements
  without obtaining the advice and consent of the Senate.’’ So simply relying on the US Constitution notion of ""treaty"" is misleading when there are two more categories under US law that are also treaties under international law. And the Congressional source on which that Wikipedia page is mostly based also says The Constitution is silent on procedures for modifying or terminating
  treaties, and agreement has not been reached between the branches on a single proper mode. [...] Twice in recent years the method of terminating a treaty [in the narrow sense, i.e. one approved by 2/3 of the Senate] has
  raised serious controversy within the United States. In 1978, President
  Carter terminated the defense treaty with the Republic of
  China [Taiwan] without the concurrence of either the Senate or Congress
  when he established diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic
  of China.
  In 1977, the new Panama Canal Treaty terminated
  the 1903, 1936, and 1955 treaties with Panama. Although a new
  treaty was approved by the Senate, some contended that the termination
  of the earlier treaties required an act of Congress, thus including
  approval by the House of Representatives as well as the
  Senate. It also talks of controversies of treaty (again in the narrow sense) modification and reinterpretation by the Executive, which are more numerous (a bit too long to quote here). Also some treaties (in the narrow sense, i.e. 2/3 Senate approved) have an explicit clause that allows the President to terminate them; e.g. KORUS: If the President does invoke Article 24.5, and no further action is taken, KORUS will terminate 180 days after such notice is given. And enough scholars think that the President can exit a treaty by himself, regardless of clauses in the treaty: Whereas it was generally understood throughout
  the nineteenth century that the termination of treaties required congressional
  involvement, the consensus on this issue disappeared in the early parts of the
  twentieth century, and today it is widely (although not uniformly) accepted that presidents have a unilateral power of treaty termination.  This after Goldwater v. Carter (on Taiwan defense exit), Kucinich v. Bush (on ABM exit) etc. Finally, there's the issue of (extended) provisional application of treaties (in the narrow sense) that have been signed but not ratified, e.g. (quoting from Congressional service again): An example of a treaty pending in the Senate that has been provisionally
  applied by executive agreement is the maritime boundary
  agreement between the United States and Cuba, signed December
  16, 1977. Originally, an executive agreement, by exchange of
  notes on April 27, 1977, had established a modus vivendi on a provisional
  maritime boundary to serve during that year while negotiations
  were underway. The treaty signed on December 16, 1977,
  contained a provision that the parties agree to apply the terms of
  the agreement ‘‘provisionally’’ for a period of 2 years from January
  1, 1978. According to the Department of State, ‘‘this agreement
  constituted an executive agreement contained within the text of the
  treaty.’’ The treaty was transmitted to the Senate on January 23,
  1979, and debated in the Senate, but final action was not taken.
  The treaty is still pending in the committee. [as of 2001] The provisional application was subsequently extended for additional periods, most recently
  by an exchange of notes of December 30, 1997 and March
  30, 1998. So such a ""treaty"" is applied for 20+ years and then denounced (say by a new president) does it really look like nothing happened, no exit from the ""treaty"" from the viewpoint of the international community (or other party to the treaty)?! And the middle category of congressional-executive agreements is also exteremely important in practice: In part because the enumerated powers of Congress and the president have been interpreted broadly, most agreements that are proposed as treaties could also have been proposed as congressional-executive agreements. For that reason, the U.S. government has frequently chosen to use congressional-executive agreements rather than treaties for controversial agreements that are unlikely to gain the required supermajority in the Senate. Examples of contentious proposals addressed in the form of congressional-executive agreements include the 1992 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the agreement whereby the United States became a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995. And yes, these congressional-executive agreements are constitutional too because of Field v. Clark. NAFTA was challeged in Made in the USA Foundation v. United States, but this challenge was stopped in the Eleventh Circuit, which cited Field v. Clark (among other things) in their decision. The congressional-executive agreements are actually how most of the US international-relations sausage is made nowadays (quoting the Congressional service again) In the period since 1939 executive agreements [this refers to both congressional-executive and just executive] have comprised more than 90 percent of the international agreements concluded. [...] Most executive agreements are concluded under the authority of a statute [and are called congressional-executive in other places; ...] 88.3 percent of international agreements reached between 1946 and 1972 were based at least partly on statutory authority [meaning they were congressional-executive rather than purely executive]. So you can't just pretend these don't matter just because they're not called treaties in the US law. So arguing from ""first principles"" by just quoting the Constitution is a pretty poor way to come to any conclusion on this question because: (i) what is actually a treaty in US vs international law and (ii) termination/exit procedures are unclear in US law (for some categories) and varied in practice."
Why does Israel build settlements in Palestine?,"This requires a bit of a history lesson. In 1949, after the first Arab-Israeli war, Israel gained its independence. Israel negotiated with its neighbors the 1949 Armistice Agreements. These agreements established the 1949 Armistice Lines (often referred to as the 1967 borders, for reasons that will shortly become apparent) as de facto borders. However, these lines were never intended to be final borders. Every Arab country bordering Israel except Lebanon (meaning Syria, Egypt, and Jordan) had clauses in the armistice agreements specifying that the armistices lines were temporary, and were not meant to define final borders. The most relevant agreement here is Israel's agreement with Jordan. The Jordanian agreement specified that the borders existed only out of military necessity and could be changed.  From the agreement with Jordan: no provision of this Agreement shall in any way prejudice the rights, claims and positions of either Party hereto in the ultimate peaceful settlement of the Palestine question, the provisions of this Agreement being dictated exclusively by military considerations. In June of 1967, Egypt blockaded the Strait of Tiran, which Israel stated it would consider an act of war. Israel responded by destroying the Egyptian airforce. Faced with an Egyptian, Syrian, and Jordanian invasion, Israel defeated the three Arab armies in six days. Israel captured the Sinai and the Gaza Strip from Egypt. Israel would give the Sinai back to Egypt in the 1979 Camp David Accords, and unilaterally withdrew from the Gaza strip according to the 2005 Unilateral Disengagement Plan. Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria, and annexed the Golan Heights in 1981 via the Golan Heights Law. Though the armistice agreement with Syria stressed the mutability of the armistice lines, and though Syria refused Israel's offer, to return the Golan Heights in exchange for peace, that annexation is not internationally recognized. Finally, we come to the West Bank. The West Bank was captured from Jordan, though only East Jerusalem has been annexed by Israel. Since the 2005 disengagement from Gaza, Israeli settlements are within the West Bank. At first, settlements were established by Israeli citizens, but with implicit government approval (Source: The Accidental Empire by Gershom Gorenberg). Many of these settlements were established on land you'd be hard pressed to call Palestinian. The Palestinians never held sovereignty over the West Bank, and rejected all promises of sovereignty over those areas (including in 1936-1937, 1938, and 1947), and some of the areas on which settlements were established, like Gush Etzion and Hevron, had Jewish communities that had existed sometimes for thousands of years before they were depopulated in Arab riots and by Arab armies in Israel's war for independence. You are correct that the international community considers the settlements illegal, but just to clear up confusion, that's not because the settlements were established on land belonging to another party. Rather, the settlements are considered illegal because they are considered to violate the Geneva Convention's prohibition on population transfer. The Geneva Convention prohibits a state from transferring its population into occupied territory (though it should be noted that settlers moving to occupied territory were not coerced). Though the international consensus is that the settlements are illegal, there is still legal dispute about this issue. As Julius Stone, former Professor of International Law at the University of Sydney points out: We would have to say that the effect of Article 49(6) is to impose an obligation on the State of Israel to ensure (by force if necessary) that these areas, despite their millennial association with Jewish life, shall be forever judenrein. Irony would thus be pushed to the absurdity of claiming that Article 49(6), designed to prevent repetition of Nazi-type genocidal policies of rendering Nazi metropolitan territories judenrein, has now come to mean that ... the West Bank .. must be made judenrein Finally, we can consider why Israel continues to promote settlement growth. Though there may be specific political reasons for specific settlement projects, the overarching reason Israel promotes settlement growth is security. Under the armistices lines, Israel was cut off by the West Bank, and enemy borders were close to population centers. For example, the distance between the West Bank city of Qalqilya and the Mediterranean sea is only about 9 miles. If you look at Israel's justifications for its settlements, from Ariel to the E1 Plan, they largely involve establishing a foothold on land it can use to protect itself (though one of the largest Israel settlements, Ma'ale Adumim, is also intended to provide cheap housing to people who can't afford to live in Jerusalem). Former International Court of Justice justice and State Department Legal Advisor Stephen Schwebel defended the settlements as justified by military necessity, saying: (a) a state [Israel] acting in lawful exercise of its right of self-defense may seize and occupy foreign territory as long as such seizure and occupation are necessary to its self-defense; (b) as a condition of its withdrawal from such territory, that State may require the institution of security measures reasonably designed to ensure that that territory shall not again be used to mount a threat or use of force against it of such a nature as to justify exercise of self-defense; It is commonly claimed that the establishment of Israeli settlements constitutes a land grab, however this claim does not stand up to scrutiny. The settlement blocs Israel wishes to keep in an agreement with Palestine comprise only a few percent of the West Bank, and Israel is willing to transfer an equal amount of land in exchange for those settlements. In 2008, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert made an offer to the Palestinians in which Israel would retain some settlement blocs and transfer an equal amount of land from behind the armistice lines to Palestine. Here is an approximate map (I say approximate because no official maps were produced). Given that Israel is willing to transfer to Palestine as much land as it wishes to keep, the settlements cannot sensibly be framed as a land grab: they grant Israel no additional land. In terms of danger: the settlements experienced a good deal of violence during the Second Intifada: hundreds of Israeli civilians died. However, since Israel installed a wall surrounding most of the settlement population, terrorist incidents have been substantially reduced, meaning that security is less of an issue for settlers now. I recognize this may be somewhat more of an answer than you were looking for, and it does cover more than you may have expected, but hopefully it gives you a better idea of the context of the settlements and why Israel pursues them. I suppose the TL;DR version of this is that Israel is promoting settlements on land that isn't Palestinian for security reasons."
Why is the lab leak theory of Covid discussed so prominently?,"The question about why would random, unidentified people make the difference seems to be off-topic here. AFAICT, civil defense protocols make no difference depending on the origin of bio hazard. However, if you re-frame your question about businesses and governments it becomes much easier to answer. Millions of businesses in virtually every country in the world suffered huge losses measured in $ billions or even trillions (however I'm not aware about any precise calculations as the pandemic is not over yet). If it gets revealed that a certain lab is somehow involved — and moreover, if the government of a country where the lab is located helped hide traces of the event, there will be a huge pressure for material compensation. Most likely, the biggest, or close to the biggest in human history. The political ramifications of such pressure would also be pretty much significant. Follow the money."
Why is lobbying not illegal in democracies?,"Let's take a moment to visit how the word ""lobbying"" came about.  In the British Houses of Parliament, there is an area called Central Lobby (between the Commons and the Lords), which is where members of the public could meet their representatives to discuss an issue and persuade them to support it.  The term ""to lobby"" came from the location in Parliament where this was done. To bring this back to your question, everyone who has asked a representative to bring attention to an issue, whether it be an individual member of the public or a large international corporation, has done a form of lobbying.  If lobbying were to be banned, it would effectively cut off two-way communication between a representative and his/her constituents. CLARIFICATION: For the purpose of this answer, a representative refers to a person elected to a legislative body."
Why do ex-government employees have security clearances?,"Security clearances is something that qualifies you as an individual. It means that you have been evaluated and trusted to a determined security level. If you are working at Company A and get a security clearance L1 and you stop working there, you do not lose the security clearance. Of course, this does not mean that you can just appear at Company A and casually ask to see their sensitive files; since you no longer need to access that data to do your job you are not allowed access to the information. If you then see a job offer at Company B that requires a L1 security clearance, then you can apply and ""use"" the same security clearance and use it to access to the information related to the new job. You can repeat until the clearance is revoked. This approach has several advantages: Once cleared, if you want to change jobs you know beforehand that you qualify for any job that requires your security clearance. The government avoids checking you again and again. Since the procedure seems rather complicated and slow, that helps a lot. In case a former employer needs to contact you for something related to your previous work, you are already cleared. At the workplace site there are some questions about security clearances; this one gives more details."
What is Hamas' strategy in attacking Israel?,"According to Hamas spokespersons and military leaders, the recent escalation is meant to be a message to Arab countries, either to make them reconsider normalizing relations with Israel or to unite them against Israel. Ghazi Hamad is a Hamas spokesperson and former deputy foreign minister for the Hamas government in Gaza. Around 5:09 of this video posted today by Al Jazeera, he explains the purpose of this specific operation to a reporter: Hamad: ... and I hope that that
that some countries especially uh Arab
countries who normalize with Israel
should understand that it is a brutal
country is a brutal state which is built
on the skulls of the Palestinians on the
blood of the Palestinian, they stop
normalization with Israel, I think it is
shame for anyone who come and make
normalization of Israel- Reporter: So are you
saying, sir, this
operation is a message to Arab countries
who have been normalizing relations with
Israel? Hamad: Yes, yes, I think it is a shame for
them it is a shame and it is a big shame
and I ask all Arabic countries all
Arabic countries to disconnect and to
cut relationship with Israel because I
think it is not, it is not a human, it is
not, it is, sorry, it is not a state
which believe in peace or existence
or believe in good, to be a good
neighbor... And in another video from Al-Jazeera today that translates a message from Hamas military commander Mohammed Deif, describing the messaging purpose of the operation: The time has come to draw the line, for
the enemy to understand their time is up
and they can't keep going without
consequences. We are announcing an
operation called Al-Aqsa Flood. In the
first part of it 5,000 rockets have been
fired. It is the time to unite all the
Arab and Islamic powers to overthrow the
Israeli occupation."
Why is Trump releasing (or not) his tax returns such a big deal?,"There's a whole wikipedia article on the topic. In a nutshell, he has been the first major party nominee since 1976 not to make his tax returns public. And he did not release them in spite of promising during the campaign that he would. When he reneged on the promise, he put forward that they were complex enough that lay people wouldn't understand them or something to that effect if memory serves me well. He also purported that he couldn't release them because they were being audited -- but that doesn't actually preclude releasing them. US voters care about this, and rightly so. There's the matter of transparency for starters. More importantly, it's the only way to know whether Trump was profiteering while holding his office. Incidentally, and contrary to what usually happens, Trump refused to divest from his business while president. One consequence of this is that foreign dignitaries stay at Trump properties to try to get favors from or access to Trump. (See the call transcript that ended up at the center of Trump's impeachment investigation among many, many other stories.) Further contributing to the poor optics of the situation, Trump asked McConnell to prioritize confirmation of the IRS counsel early in his presidency. Desmond, his nominee, had briefly advised the Trump Organization on tax issues before Trump took office. At this point the most charitable explanation is that Trump is not as wealthy as he claims to be and is withholding the returns to protect his ego. The less charitable one is that there might be a few rats in the returns that he'd rather keep away from public scrutiny. Lending further credence to the latter, a whistleblower brought attention to possible improper ""efforts to influence"" the mandatory IRS audits of Trump's (or Pence's) tax returns."
Has politics always been so polarized?,"Polarisation is not entirely new, but it’s not a constant either.  Looking just at US national politics, there have been other periods of very strong polarisation (e.g. the late 19th century, following the Civil War), and other periods of comparative consensus (e.g. the mid–late 20th century, during the Cold War). Fivethirtyeight.com has run quite a few articles on this topic, looking at various quantitative measures of polarisation through recent US history.  A good recent run-down is Geoffrey Skelly’s Why a Biden blowout didn’t happen…, and more can be found under their polarization tag.  Broadly, their analyses support the claim that on a historical scale, the current polarisation is not unique or extreme; but it is the most polarised that US politics has been since WWII, so within living memory for most Americans, it is new. (Other answers give further good points which I won’t repeat, especially comparisons in a broader international and historical context.)"
Why did the UK trigger Article 50 before having a negotiation position?,"You've missed one important occurrence in the sequence of events, which is something that none of the other answers have addressed: Calling a general election exactly 3 weeks after invoking Article 50 was an attempt to gain a greater majority in parliament, as at that moment the Conservative party were doing incredibly well in the polls, at one point holding a 21-point lead against the main opposition Labour. Invoking Article 50 at this point would allow the conservatives to outline their Brexit position during the election campaign, effectively allowing the people to vote between the parties for their version of Brexit. Each party would be campaigning for what their Brexit negotiation position would be, so it would be a de facto second referendum. Triggering Article 50 before calling the election meant that rather than allowing their opposition to campaign on a ""we won't invoke Article 50"" or ""we will hold a referendum on what us leaving should entail"", they had already triggered a countdown that would mean their opponents would have to either promise to revoke Article 50, or come up with their own Brexit plan in 2 months to convince voters, followed by only 21 months to negotiate it. Had the conservatives gained votes based on the poll numbers before the election was called, there would have been a significant conservative majority and May wouldn't have even needed all of her own party to agree to what the deal should be. The concerns of the Eurosceptic hard-brexiteers (that are causing so many problems now) could have probably been ignored. Of course, this didn't happen, and the conservatives lost their majority. To summarize: before coming to a firm decision on the conservative Brexit position, Theresa May called a general election in an attempt to gain a greater majority in parliament (which the polls all but guaranteed she would get) so that she wouldn't have to compromise so much with the most Eurosceptic in her party. Triggering Article 50 before calling the election was an attempt to force the opposition parties to turn the election into a vote on which version of Brexit voters wanted. Note: this was the intention, but it didn't turn out as the conservatives wanted as Labour refused to clarify their Brexit position other than that they would ""deliver Brexit"". They instead made the election about the conservative's domestic record, which was much weaker, which led to the conservative majority collapsing."
Why is the US so religious compared to other Western democracies?,"While the United States doesn't have a national religion, the US has fairly deep religious liberty roots, and it has lead to a few twists and turns in the religious sentiment Every year, Americans celebrate Thanksgiving (a major US holiday), and most children could tell you some version of the story of the Pilgrims and Native Americans. The truth is, it was a religious holiday long before Abraham Lincoln formalized it Pilgrims and Puritans who emigrated from England in the 1620s and 1630s carried the tradition of Days of Fasting and Days of Thanksgiving with them to New England. The modern Thanksgiving holiday tradition is traced to a well-recorded 1619 event in Virginia and a sparsely documented 1621 celebration at Plymouth in present-day Massachusetts. The 1619 arrival of 38 English settlers at Berkeley Hundred in Charles City County, Virginia, concluded with a religious celebration as dictated by the group's charter from the London Company, which specifically required ""that the day of our ships arrival at the place assigned ... in the land of Virginia shall be yearly and perpetually kept holy as a day of thanksgiving to Almighty God."" The 1621 Plymouth feast and thanksgiving was prompted by a good harvest, which the Pilgrims celebrated with Native Americans, who helped them get through the previous winter by giving them food in that time of scarcity. Then there were the religious immigrants of the 19th and 20th centuries. Jews, for instance, migrated from an openly hostile Russia (a story popularized in a 1986 children's movie). There are many Christian immigrants with similar stories. People still immigrate to the US for religious reasons (Christian or not) to this day. After World War II, the Cold War brought proxy wars between the US and Soviet Russia. One point of tension was that the United States was seen as a ""Christian nation"", while the Soviets were staunch Atheists. It was well known there was active hostility of the Soviets against religion Orthodox churches were stripped of their valuables in 1922 at the instigation of Lenin and Trotsky. In subsequent years, including both the Stalin and the Khrushchev periods, tens of thousands of churches were torn down or desecrated, leaving behind a disfigured wasteland that bore no resemblance to Russia such as it had stood for centuries. Entire districts and cities of half a million inhabitants were left without a single church. Our people were condemned to live in this dark and mute wilderness for decades, groping their way to God and keeping to this course by trial and error. The grip of oppression that we have lived under, and continue to live under, has been so great that religion, instead of leading to a free blossoming of the spirit, has been manifested in asserting the faith on the brink of destruction, or else on the seductive frontiers of Marxist rhetoric, where so many souls have come to grief. This let McCarthyism (where Communists in America were hunted down by McCarthy) define atheism as de-facto Communist sentiment Today we are engaged in a final, all-out battle between communistic atheism and Christianity. The modern champions of communism have selected this as the time. And, ladies and gentlemen, the chips are down—they are truly down. As such, the 1950s saw a rapid rise in religious participation Churches and schools were being greatly expanded to accommodate the growing population, and organized religion was in its heyday. On a typical Sunday morning in the period from 1955-58, almost half of all Americans were attending church – the highest percentage in U.S. history. During the 1950s, nationwide church membership grew at a faster rate than the population, from 57 percent of the U.S. population in 1950 to 63.3 percent in 1960. Much of this generation (the ""baby boomers"") are still alive and have passed on their faith to their children. Consider that the Democrat's ""liberal lion"" Ted Kennedy was responsible for pushing the Federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act in the Senate, which drew bipartisan support. In 1979, Jerry Falwell Sr. founded The Moral Majority, which sought to mix Christianity with political conservatism and eventually the Republican party. It helped to elect Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush and defined a period of time in America where Conservative Christianity was a political force to be reckoned with. It's shortly after this we start to see some significant generational declines in religious participation  Despite the intermingling of politics and religion, America still has a large network of churches in most communities, and these churches are not going quietly into the night. Southern Baptists (the largest protestant denomination in America) has a fairly robust church planting and outreach ministry. The Catholic Church runs a large network of hospitals and they also have a fairly large charitable organization. With a stable base of legacy Christians still supporting them, America's churches continue to impact their local communities, which helps drive membership."
Why would the government force its population to save for retirement?,"Old people starving is bad. There exist many people who don't bother with financial planning and they might end up without enough to live on when they are too old to work. By forcing a pension you avoid anyone having to work until they die, or dying shortly after they can't work. Many of these social programs also divert funds to other people who need assistance, and by bundling it with a pension system it is less obnoxious to the tax payers. Outlawing skydiving or smoking as retirement plans (jokes on him - I'll be dead by then) is of course a cost, but most people prefer improving the conditions of the people who are worst off."
Why don't the other countries of Europe maintain as massive a military as Russia does?,"This is a great question about both politics and history. It relates directly to the changing nature of what a ""country"" is. First, let me directly answer your questions: There are two easy answers for this, namely a) Because the US military is present in the region, so the people feel secure from Russian attack and b) because the voters in these countries vote for social services like health care instead of military spending. Germany, UK, France, and other western European countries are more than capable of spending a ton of money on military. They choose not to because they are working as a team within the Nato alliance - and they do this for a couple of reasons that will be elaborated below. Because Russia can do as it pleases within its means! As for why it does, the reason is the same as for other countries: they spend the amount they can afford for its constituent population to feel ""secure"". Russia is a huge country with strong neighbors. In the past 100 years, they have fought wars along most of these borders. While the western European invasion during WWII was significant, it is notable that there was a small hot war with China in the '60s and '70s, and war with Afghanistan. They still have territorial disputes with Japan - and they are slowly being intimidated by an expanding Nato that is vocally hostile to the Russian state and hence the Russian population. This is the most critical question you ask, I will answer with a counter question: do these countries have a choice? At the end of WWII, Europe was largely occupied in the west by the US military, and in the east by the Soviet military. One could say that all the countries in the East became client states of the Soviet Union, and that those in the West became client states of the USA. Both the Soviet Union and  especially the USA, maintained large military bases in these states. The US still has numerous bases. Could we call the US an occupying power? What would it take for Germany to end the presence of the US military on its soil? However, most Americans and Western Europeans bristle at the idea that they are involuntarily ""occupied"" by Americans, they are instead ""Allies""! And it is good, of course to be best friends with the rich American business interests. Trade and mutual economic benefits keep Germany, France, and the UK, most of Europe, in this alliance. Indeed, besides a handful of nations like Iran, North Korea, Syria, Cuba, Venezuela, and Bolivia, everyone tries to stay on the good side of the Americans. Both for commercial reasons, and because the US, frankly, has a dominant military presence just about everywhere. Perhaps a commenter can correct me, but I think for some reason the US has ~5000 military bases overseas. NATO is important because it indicates what relationship these countries have with Washington. Russia is in Syria for a variety of reasons; it has more interest in the area than Syria's former colonial masters, the UK and France. An important point to note is that the concept of a country is fairly new; I have read, and agree, that modern states did not become such an important unit of human organization until the Great Depression in the 1930s; at that time the problems facing them - broken economies and socialist movements - the country level government was the only organization existing that could solve these problems while the existing power structure stayed in power. Since then, states are portrayed as ""immortal"" and ""ever lasting"". But in truth, they are not. Competing levels of organization - family, village, community, province, supranational, class, or something else - can eventually take primacy in terms of absolute power. What will happen is a matter of conjecture, but the point is clear: countries are not the only level of organization. For example, what is the EU? Are Germany and France and UK independent countries, as the UN says, or are they members of a single supranational organization? Both really, for example, the UK will have to negotiate its secession or pay a heavy price. While everyone can agree that in name these countries are independent, they do heavily coordinate most of their economical and political activity. This includes military activity. The level of military coordination between western European countries and the US means that spending on military need only match Russian military spending on a collective basis. I think with data about US spending and presence in and around Europe, the collective manpower and economic investment will be far greater than that of Russia."
Why are U.S. territories not allowed to vote in U.S. presidential elections?,"Article 2, Section 2 of the Constitution begins:  Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors... Until this section of the constitution is amended to read ""Each State, Territory, or Federal District..."" or to entirely rewrite the presidential election process to be based on citizenship of the individual voter rather than an electoral college whose members are determined by state laws, it is constitutional that residents of the territories cannot participate in presidential elections."
What significance could the information in Donald Trump's tax return have to his campaign?,"There are no ""rich people"" forms.  However, there are forms that are far more likely to be interesting when a rich person files them.  For example, when someone claims charitable donations on Schedule A or 8283, they need to list the donations.  He also has to write out what personal business related tax deductions he's taking on his Schedule C tax forms.  There's also a lot of single use forms.  The typical filer only fills out one or two.  And of course many of his forms are going to be multiple pages where a typical person only uses part of one page.   There are very few actual disqualifications for President.  He needs to be a ""natural born citizen"", a US resident for at least fourteen years, and at least thirty-five years of age.  He can't have been President previously for six or more years.  His tax forms won't say anything about his citizenship and are unlikely to contain information suggesting his age is below thirty-five or that he has been President previously.  It is conceivable but unlikely that they show that Trump was claiming residency outside the United States.  It's far more likely that they show information that would make people not vote for him because they look bad.  Such information would not be disqualifying as I would use the word but could still be negative.   Yes.   Trump is clearly hiding his tax forms.  As his sons (Eric and Don, Jr.) have indicated, the main reason for this is that many people won't understand the information he filed.  The most charitable reading of this is that his taxes are complex and complicated.  A less charitable way of taking this is that his forms show him taking deductions to which he is not entitled or not counting as income things that he should have.   Note that the claim that his taxes have been audited for the last fifteen years suggests that the latter interpretation is correct.  The IRS has limited funds for audits.  The only way they could justify multiple audits is if the previous ones made them more money than they cost.  Trump's sons may believe that this indicates that the IRS behaved inappropriately, but the neutral arbiter of the US court system apparently wasn't supportive.   IRS audits are different from SEC audits or other government audits.  Other audits are to detect wrong doing.  It's expected for them to cost money and they are budgeted to do so.  Tax audits are to increase revenue.   Also note the following from the IRS Audit FAQ:   Generally, the IRS can include returns filed within the last three years in an audit.  Additional years can be added if a substantial error is identified.  Generally, if a substantial error is identified, the IRS will not go back more than the last six years. Trump has said that his current audits date back to 2008.  That is well over the three year limit, suggesting that either he is getting different treatment or that there was a substantial error on his returns.   Trump has consistently claimed more wealth than other sources think he has.  He has put it at $10 billion or more, while Forbes has him at $4.5 billion and Fortune at $3.75 billion.  Tax returns would have the exact numbers for both revenue and expense.  They also might hint at debt numbers, as they would show interest paid.   Trump said that he was going to donate to veterans.  He failed to do so.  He was caught out on it.  He eventually made the donation.  So, yes, there is good reason to think that he would lie about making charitable donations.  Note that he has other explanations for this.   Trump did not deny paying zero taxes in the debate.  He said that if he was, it was proof of his good business sense.  Absent a denial, that seems fully justified.  Of course, that would mean that Hillary Clinton's claim that Trump's tax plan would reduce his taxes is bunk, but that's politics.  There's no compiler to enforce coherence of positions.  She can claim both that Trump isn't paying taxes and that his tax plan would reduce his taxes.  And we can make fun of her for being inconsistent the same way we make fun of Trump for buying his suits from China while saying that it is wrong for people to do so.   In the tax forms Mitt Romney released in 2012, he actually didn't take some of the deductions to which he was entitled to increase his apparent tax rate.  Romney had two big problems in public perception of his tax rate.  First, he tithed 10% of his income to religious charities, which was deductible.  Second, most of his income was investment income, which gets a privileged rate.  The point of this comparison to Romney is that Romney did experience negative results from releasing his taxes.  So Trump has reason to believe that his tax returns would be (mis)interpreted in the same way.   It's not clear that Trump is going to have problems with donating too much to charity (too much to have a politically correct tax rate), but a high amount of investment income is very likely.  Also, Trump is likely to have a higher business income than Romney.  People might use his revenue numbers as a base rather than his income (profit) numbers.   Just as an aside, I personally have no problem with Presidential candidates or anyone else not paying taxes on charitable donations.  To my mind, they should be subtracted from the denominator when calculating the tax rate.  However, when those numbers are actually calculated currently they do not do this.  This has the effect of making those who donate a lot to charity look like they pay a lower tax rate than they really do.   Note that it is entirely possible that Trump's tax returns are clean as a whistle.  If so, it's rather silly for him not to show them.  Thus, it's plausible to suspect that there is something that either appears wrong (e.g. a low effective tax rate) or which is wrong (e.g. inappropriately taken deductions).  So long as he refuses to release his returns, it's reasonable for Clinton to speculate as to why.  Similarly, it's reasonable for Trump to speculate as to why she deleted her emails or refuses to release her transcripts.  "
Why must Chinese maps be obfuscated?,"Just to clarify, this isn't at all like the GPS Selective Availability case where bits were unavailable unless you knew the key. The Chinese don't have their own GPS satellites (duh) setting these coordinates. What this  GCJ-02 business is is a non-disclosed, but not-so-hard-to-reverse engineer conversion algorithm from other coordinates. The big picture looks like this:  That's the reverse-engineered conversion from the ""bog standard"" WGS-84, displayed as a vector field. As the blog from which I too that image says, the offsets are basically constant locally, but they vary across China. Google bought the China map data from an officially approved Chinese source company. Other maps providers (that didn't/don't operate locally in China) aren't skittish to transform/align the Chinese maps to WGS84.  On Google something funny happens even when you’re viewing in the US: the Chinese border crossing plaza (on the north side) doesn’t line up with the Macau crossing (on the south side). This is due to a law where companies are forbidden to map China accurately, OpenStreetMap’s ability to avoid that law, and the independence of Macau and also Hong Kong (which has the same discrepancy). As for the reason, according to one Chinese developer in a post from April 2015: Before the WGS-84 <--> GCJ-02 transform algorithm leaked and made available everywhere on the Internet (eg. this repo), some people tried to get a lot of samples of WGS-GCJ point pairs and sold the dataset to people in need. But this kind of dataset is no longer useful because we now have the algorithm itself. Are all these in the Chinese law?
  No. They are mostly in some vague administrative orders or industry regulations made by the government. There is a Code of Geological Survey (http://www.gov.cn/ziliao/flfg/2005-08/05/content_20947.htm, Chinese), though. But it only says data obtained through survey is classified by default (Article 29) and companies without a permission cannot do survey (Chapter 5). Nothing about GCJ-02 is made officially public. Why does the Chinese government do this?
  National security, they say. But people developing LBS apps tends to believe that it is because of money. The government charges Chinese companies for the ""shift correction"" feature. We need to make a reservation with the government and take the source code of our app to the bureau to get the feature compiled with our code. Since then Xinhua reported new regulations on maps being passed at the end of 2015, and taking effect in 2016. Amazingly these are available in English, but they say nothing about using some specific coordinates; so the ambiguity noted in that Chinese dev comment basically continues. The new regulations  do say that maps must be submitted for government review, except in some very limited circumstances.  For on-line maps there's this verbiage in the new regs (which doesn't clarify much): Article 33. To provide the public with services such as geospatial positioning, geoinformation uploading and labeling, and map database development, a provider of Internet map services shall obtain the necessary qualification certificate for surveying and mapping in accordance with law. To engage in Internet map publishing, a provider of Internet map services shall be subject to review by and approval of the competent publication administration department of the State Council in accordance with law. Article 34. A provider of Internet map services shall place its map data servers within the territory of the People’s Republic of China, and shall establish the management system and introduce safeguard measures for the security of Internet map data. The competent administration departments for surveying, mapping and geoinformation of the people’s governments at or above the county level shall, jointly with the relevant departments, strengthen supervision and administration of the security of Internet map data. [...] Article 38　A provider of Internet map services shall use maps that have been reviewed and approved in accordance with law, and strictly verify newly added content of the Internet maps, and it shall, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the State, file such content with the competent administration department of the State Council for surveying, mapping and geoinformation or the competent administration department for surveying, mapping and geoinformation of the province, autonomous region, or municipality directly under the Central Government. Basically it seems to be a system of: give us your maps and will give them back to you as we think they should be published... which at some point probably involves the coordinate system, but it's not mentioned explicitly in these regs. There are some up to 100,000 yuan fines for not following these regulations. Also according to a Chinese page, GCJ-02 (although developed by the  State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping) is not the same as the official Chinese CGCS2000 system, for which a lot public info is available. So it's hard to answer a ""why"" for something that's hard to even find an official record that it needs to happen... Unless the Chinese decide to change that (leaked code) and ban all prior maps, this doesn't compare to the SAASM, which supposedly changed keys (on the satellites and receivers) once in a while. SAASM even allows rekeying over insecure channels, while the older PPS-SM required a secure channel (e.g. taking the GPS device to an authorized/secure location for rekeying.) I suppose I should mention that the Chinese are building their own GPS alternative, the BDS (BeiDou Navigation Satellite System), which apparently became operational in December last year, but that's a different story. And BDS broadcasts its location info in the aforementioned CGC[S]2000. Finally, Baidu ""Total View"" has a Street View equivalent with altered photos ... like [badly] disappeared buildings etc. You'd probably be hard pressed to find an official explanation for this either. That article contains some speculation about the reasons, but that's about it."
Why can't Northern Ireland just have a stay/leave referendum?,"If you don't understand Irish history then you can't understand anything about Northern Ireland. Briefly, the whole of Ireland used to be part of the British Empire. This was due to some uncommonly bloody history since the Tudor era (roughly 1550 to 1600) in which the Protestant UK invaded Ireland and then tried to suppress repeated rebellions by Catholics. Part of this effort involved bringing Protestant settlers in from Scotland to displace the native Irish Catholics. This led to a strong Protestant presence in the north-east corner of Ireland. When the rest of Ireland won its independence in 1922 this Protestant area created a problem. The Protestant population were accustomed to being in a position of power relative to the Catholics (think Jim Crow) and would fight to maintain that position. The nascent Irish Republic was not in a position to put down a guerilla war in its north, so a settlement was reached where Ireland was divided along the current border. The area chosen had an overall Protestant majority, but due to the patchwork nature of settlement and the significant Catholic population there are parts of Northern Ireland that are primarily Catholic. These people never accepted the legitimacy of British rule over any part of Ireland. At the same time the anti-Catholic discrimination remained in the North, creating an ongoing undercurrent of Catholic anger. During the 1960s and 70s the Provisional Irish Republican Army (aka ""IRA"" or ""Provos"") undertook a guerilla/terrorist war against what they considered to be British occupation. In the 1990s this was ended by the Good Friday Agreement between Tony Blair and Gerry Adams (there were others involved, but they were the key players). An important component of this was the European Union; because both Ireland and the UK were part of the EU the border controls between Northern Ireland and the Republic could be dismantled and citizens of both North and South could simply drive over the border as if it were not there. It's worth considering these border controls some more, to understand why this is such a sticking point. Before the border was opened the border posts had been manned by the British Army, so the IRA attacked them, so they were strongly fortified. If you crossed the border then you had to queue to have your car or lorry carefully inspected by nervous young men carrying fully automatic rifles. The IRA brought guns and explosives into Northern Ireland from sympathisers in the South, so anyone with a Catholic name would be singled out for extra scrutiny (at best). They were widely hated. To reduce the problem of policing the border to something manageable the Army also destroyed smaller roads and bridges that vehicles might otherwise use to evade their checkpoints, and erected fortified watchtowers on hills. In some areas these posts had to be resupplied by helicopter because supply lorries would be too vulnerable to attack. If Northern Ireland were to hold a referendum on union with the Republic then it would fail because Protestants are still in a majority there. However Catholics would still refuse to acknowledge the legitimacy of this because in their view it should be the whole of Ireland (North plus South) voting, as Ireland should never have been divided. The word ""gerrymandered"" generally turns up in discussion of the subject. The UK government now has four basic options to choose between: Remain part of the EU single market, accepting EU rules and regulations, but without the seats in the EU parliament and other decision-making parts of the EU. This is not what the people of the UK voted for in the referendum. (Technically the EU free trade area was not on the ballot paper, but Leave campaigning focussed on issues such as free movement, EU regulations and membership costs which go with the EU free trade area). Implement a ""hard border"" between Northern Ireland and the Republic. This would mean a return of the hated border controls and quite possibly a resurgence of the IRA. This is not acceptable to the Irish Republic or the EU. It is also something that the UK government previously promised the EU that it would not do. Implement an equivalent border in the Irish sea between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, and keep Northern Ireland in the European common market. This would make Northern Ireland a de-facto part of the Republic for most purposes and hence is not acceptable to the Protestant majority in Northern Ireland. It would also be rejected by many in Great Britain, especially by Theresa May's own party, the full name of which is ""The Conservative and Unionist Party"". Crucially, Theresa May's government does not have a majority in parliament at present and can only pass legislation with the support of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which represents exactly those Protestants. So if Theresa May looks like allowing such a thing the DUP will simply yank the carpet from under her. The ""Singapore model"": abolish all import controls and duties on any goods from anywhere (anything more selective would run foul of WTO rules). This would force the Irish government to impose a hard border for traffic leaving Northern Ireland, but at least it wouldn't be the fault of the UK. Some Brexiteers have seriously suggested this, but the economic and political implications make such a radical course very unlikely. Update: Jan 2021 We've pretty much ended up with option 3, softened somewhat by a free trade agreement. You can now cross the NI/Eire border without any checks, but ferrying goods over the sea between NI and Great Britain requires paperwork and possibly paying duties if you can't prove that the goods will stay in the North. Boris Johnson was able to negotiate this and push it through parliament, partly because he had a big enough majority not to need the Unionist parties, and partly because the Labour party decided not to oppose the only deal on offer."
Why do dictators ban their people from traveling?,"People are resources, dictators (and oppressive regimes in general) don't want them to defect to other countries because they want them working for their regime.  Some of them are going to be people that the regime has put their resources into, like scientists and doctors, but even laborers are valuable for actually gathering and assembling the resources the regime needs.  Additionally, the regime especially does not want people with access to sensitive information to defect to their enemies.  That isn't just spies and soldiers, there are plenty of ""regular"" government positions that require access to something the regime would not want falling into enemy hands, like economic data that could be used for propaganda.  Obviously this is true of any country, and even in democracies with strong human rights records, people with access to classified information are usually required to submit to strict scrutiny of their international travel.  Given that they aren't concerned with human rights, dictatorships can take the easier option of restricting travel to any citizens. However, defection is really a piece of a bigger issue - oppressive regimes maintain their rule in part by controlling information.  Here's an interesting article that talks about how dictatorships keep power.  Jerrold Post, director of the political psychology program at George Washington University, is referenced: Post said that in both Iraq and North Korea, dictators tightly controlled the flow of information. That control was upended in the past two years during the ""Arab spring"" revolts that swept away despots in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and some of the Gulf states, revolts that were encouraged in large part by information spread by cell phones and social media.  North Korea is probably the most extreme example of information control (according to Reporters without Borders, they are dead last in Press Freedom in the world), but this can be seen in other oppressive regimes - for example, China attempts to limit access to ""wrong"" information via its Great Firewall.  This is thrown out the window if citizens go somewhere with free media and realize they are being lied to.  Traveling can be the cause of their dissension, rather than a symptom. Known dissidents may also be restricted from traveling so that they can not coordinate with foreign countries or anti-dictatorship organizations, and to prevent them from smuggling contraband or evidence of the regime's misinformation back into the country.  Regimes can control the information originating in their country, but once someone is outside their borders the regime cannot control who they speak with."
Why are Weapon Restriction Laws considered Liberal?,"Labels like ""conservative"" versus ""liberal"" or ""left"" versus ""right"" are often applied to larger-scale political movements, parties or ways of thinking, without every single detail being thrown into the mix. The labels mean different things in different environments anyway: what is called ""right wing conservative capitalist"" in some European countries might well be perceived as ""left wing liberal communist"" in the United states. In the case at hand, the point of view on gun laws simply seems to roughly follow the political distinctions of ""liberal"" versus ""conservative"" in the way that ""conservative"" politicians tend to not want to change the existing (perceived by many, liberal) gun laws. Not wanting to change them is indeed conservative, even if the laws themselves may be considered liberal. Of course, the distinction ""liberal"" versus ""conservative"" is a strange one. After all, a liberal idealist living in a liberal country would probably be conservative - meaning they don't want to change the status quo. It just goes to show how those labels get thrown at things, and once they stick, change their meaning."
Why has the Israel-Palestine conflict reignited in May 2021?,"Since you emphasize the word now in your question, I'll try to answer with an emphasis on the current escalation. For the more general question asking why there is a conflict at all, I'll simply refer to the Wikipedia article because it's such a complex issue that I cannot explain well. So the questions I'll try to address are as follows: I want to know why Gaza is being attacked now, who is attacking, and what they want. The parties in conflict are the state of Israel and Hamas. The state of Israel has an advanced military, the IDF, that it uses to defend itself. Hamas is classified as a terrorist organisation by a number of countries (including the US, the EU and Israel), but it also controls the Gaza Strip. Hamas' aims are, according to Wikipedia: Hamas, as its name (Islamic Resistance Movement) implies, aims to liberate Palestine from the Israeli occupation, and transform the country into an Islamic state. Which of these two objectives is the primary goal is disputed. Israel is a state and its current military operations in the conflict are described as self defense. For example, in an interview with Face the Nation, Israeli PM Netanyahu said: And I think any country has to defend itself. It has a natural right of self-defense. We'll do whatever it takes to restore order and quiet and the security of our people and deterrence. We're trying to degrade Hamas's terrorist abilities and to degrade their will to do this again. I am not aware of any concrete demands that motivate the fighting in this current episode of violence. This is the more interesting emphasis of your question. The previous answers are more general and could apply to previous escalations alike. One of the reasons the fighting has escalated as far as it has or has gone on for this long (Wikipedia's timeline for the current escalation starts on May 6th, though it considers heightened tensions in the weeks leading up to that) is political. Specifically, on both sides of the conflict there are people in power who can use the escalation as a distraction from their own internal politics. As such, I'd argue that it's not just the events in the timeline that explain the lead up to the current level of violence. On both sides, the leadership has taken steps that are escalatory in nature, not aimed de-escalating the situation. Note that he isn't phrasing the military response as self-defense, instead he uses language of revenge (""levy a heavy price"") and strength (""full force""). According to the Hindustan Times: In a televised address, Netanyahu said Sunday evening the attacks were continuing at “full-force” and will “take time.“ Israel “wants to levy a heavy price” from Gaza’s militant Hamas rulers, he said, flanked by his defense minister and political rival, Defense Minister Benny Gantz, in a show of unity. That rhetoric may seem insignificant but it's adding more oil to the fire. That directly benefits Hamas because it needs the perception of Israeli aggression to justify its actions and to remain popular with Palestinians. That's not a diplomatic request. Basically, it's setting up a justification for escalating further. According to nationalpost.com: In Gaza, a Hamas spokesman said the leadership of a joint command of armed movements in the Palestinian enclave had given Israel “an ultimatum until 6 p.m. (1500 GMT)” to withdraw its security forces from the al Aqsa mosque compound and Jerusalem’s Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood. We see that there's some escalating on both sides, but couldn't that serve some genuine purpose (as seen from their own perspective in the broader conflict)? If indeed it is in the best interest of the state of Israel or the Palestinian people (rather than just their respective leaderships) then it makes sense to escalate. I think the answer is no, there's nothing to be gained by escalating further. The Israelis will not defeat all of Hamas, so escalating means there will be more violence in the future. Hamas will use any Israeli attacks to gain popularity and boost its recruitment. As anecdotally illustrated by one young recruit who was quoted by Haaretz: Hatem, one of the teens who attended Hamas camp, is just 14, but he has already lived through three wars with Israel. Now, he’s proud of being ready for the next war. “The Israelis killed my niece last summer. Now I want to kill them,” he told the AFP news agency after finishing the camp. From the view of the Palestinian people, it doesn't make rational sense to escalate either. Their weapons are much less advanced, so any attack will be returned multifold. This is clear from comparing Israeli vs Palestinian casualties (both in terms of deaths and wounded), for example here. In the end, the current episode of violence is not a conflict that can be won (by either side). The best explanation, I think, is that it's politically convenient to escalate now for both sides.  The political considerations on both sides are as follows: On the one hand, there is the fragile domestic position of Israeli PM Netanyahu. According to the Washington Post on May 12th: For Netanyahu, the escalation of fighting brought a last-minute reprieve from what could have been the end of his record run at the top of Israeli politics. Earlier this week, a group of rival political parties were reportedly within days — even hours — of forming Israel’s first government not to include Netanyahu in 12 years. Just before tensions exploded Monday, a disparate collection of Israeli right-wing, centrist and left-wing parties, united only in their goal of ousting Netanyahu, indicated they were nearly ready to announce they had the support of a majority of parliament members, clearing the way to form a governing coalition. By the end of the day, the political process had come to a halt. For now, amid the unrest, the prospect of a non-Netanyahu government is frozen and, political observers said, may be out of reach entirely. “They were just about to call the president and say we have reached a deal, we have a coalition,” said Gayil Talshir, professor of political science at Hebrew University. “The riot came just in time to prevent the change of government in Israel.” The same conclusions were reached in Israeli media. According to a compilation in the Guardian, dated May 13th: Lapid [Yair Lapid, the Israeli opposition leader] said there had been a “complete loss of control” and accused Netanyahu of “leading us to anarchy”. He added: “Jewish and Arab rioters have declared war on Israel, and there’s no response, no government, no police, no leadership.” Writing in Yedioth Ahronoth, Israel’s biggest-circulation newspaper, the commentator Nadav Eyal said: “We are seeing dissolution; we are seeing the fracturing of our social compact.” Louis Fishman, an associate professor at Brooklyn College, wrote in Haaretz that Netanyahu’s “greatest magic trick” had been to blind Israeli Jews to their state’s oppression of the Palestinians. “But even the most carefully constructed house of cards eventually starts tumbling down, and that exactly is what is happening now … Impregnable Netanyahuism, the work of a master illusionist, is shattering.” Lapid said the events of the past week were “no excuse” for keeping Netanyahu in place. “Quite the opposite. They are exactly the reason why he should be replaced as soon as possible.” On the other hand, Hamas faces a similar situation in its internal politics. According to a Washington Post column dated May 13th: For Hamas, its entry into the fray comes amid a tangled intra-Palestinian squabble. It’s at odds with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, whose Fatah faction holds nominal sway over the West Bank. (In an earlier era, Israel allowed the emergence of Islamist outfits like Hamas in a tacit bid to undermine the strength of more-secular Palestinian resistance groups like Fatah.) Abbas decided to scrap long-anticipated Palestinian elections this month, further delaying any prospect of reconciliation among the bitterly divided Palestinian leadership and intensifying public frustration with the increasingly unpopular PA. To illustrate how Hamas can benefit from the current violence, the following paragraphs of the same WP column further illustrate how Hamas benefits politically: One Ramallah-based pollster and former Palestinian Authority official said: “From preliminary indicators, many people in the West Bank are admiring what Hamas is doing. We don’t know their motivations, but it was effective of Hamas to confront Israel on the basis of their support for the Palestinian people of Jerusalem.” “Hamas does not actually want something from Israel,” wrote Michael Koplow of the Israel Policy Forum. “It is seizing upon the current moment as an excuse to capitalize on a unique opportunity within Palestinian politics, and the rockets that Israelis are sheltering from are Hamas’s effort to get a leg up on Fatah.”"

"Instead of a Universal Basic Income program, why not implement a ""Universal Basic Needs"" program?","Different people have different needs. Determining those needs is difficult, expensive, and subjective. Universal basic income has been proposed as a simple solution that should work well enough for most people with minimal bureaucracy. People with special needs would still need other forms of support. Some reasons why universal basic income is supposed to be a good idea: Of course, we don't really know whether universal basic income works as advertised, because there have not been any large-scale experiments with it. Edited to make the answer more explicit: There is no widespread agreement on what are the needs welfare is supposed to address, or who is entitled to which forms of support. When a new party or coalition gains power, it often changes the welfare system in various ways. Eventually the system becomes a complex patchwork of conflicting aims and requirements that is difficult to understand and expensive to operate. I listed a few points on how various UBI proposals try to fix the observed deficiencies in needs-based welfare systems. In particular, the third point explains why UBI proponents think giving people money is better than addressing their needs directly."
"""Terrorism has no religion."" Why don't Moderate Muslims restrain their Radical counterparts?","You say these things don't happen when they do. Case in point, the notorious Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (9/11 mastermind and behind Daniel Pearl's execution) who WAS jailed in Egypt early in his life, had to flee Bosnia when intelligence had pinpointed him, and was finally captured and turned over to the US by Pakistan. In other words, he was targeted by Muslim  countries. Further, the number of Muslim clerics who have advocated for peace is huge - from the Grand Mufti Talip Atalay of Cyprus to Jordan's top cleric, to the Nairobi Muslim Cleric's Peace Caravan to Iraq's Ali al-Sistani issuing a fatwa last year calling for ""Citizens to defend the country, its people, the honor of its citizens, and its sacred places,"" against the Islamic State of Iraq. For local police/intelligence operations capturing radical elements, the list is long. Recent examples have happened in Yemen, UAE, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia for example.  The only thing that doesn't happen? It doesn't get reported on enough. On that you are correct. EDIT:
As to your question ""how could a thoughtful person tell Radical Islamism from Any Islamism?"" that one is easy. Radicals wear their militancy openly, all you need to do is listen to them. Its no different from how to spot a racist, or a militant Christian calling for the world to bend to their beliefs. Its really not hard to engage people if you put forth the effort. Lets also not forget that legal power often means nothing if you can't enforce it. ISIS flowed into northern Iraq well armed and facing a shattered and largely disarmed citizenry, and it is near impossible to arrest the guy with the bigger gun when you don't have one. The people who are being effective against them in that region? Well armed Kurds with coalition support And while it may be hoped that the calls for peace from noted clerics might be all that is needed, unfortunately there is even more of a sectarian divide in the middle east than their was in northern ireland, and the IRA wasn't about to listen to the Archbishop of Canterbury either. Priests can help, absolutely, but in such an environment they can often only reach their own followers and maybe not even then due to illiteracy and isolation in many regions.  The radicals have their radical clerics, and they are the problem - not the moderate ones. Look what happened when Arafat renounced terrorism: The radicals marginalized him and the Israelis barricaded him in a compound thus limiting his ability to work for peace when was what we have to hope for: radicals laying down arms.

Why did the DNC try to prevent Bernie Sanders from getting the Democratic nomination?,"In short, because Democratic Party in USA is roughly split between two factions (I'll label them ""progressive"" and ""establishment"" just for the sake of labeling). FiveThirtyEight covered this split in great detail in the last couple of months (as well as a split in Republican party); but for the purposes of this question, Sanders represented the ""progressive"" wing and Clinton ""established"" wing. DNC leadership from what I understand is largely ""established"" wing and as such preferred Clinton to Sanders. Why? That could be for a variety of reasons: pragmatic politics (they could have thought that an establishment candidate has a better chance in general election, which is more or less the mainstream theory in Political Science since (e.g. Median Voter Theorem) at the very least McGovern's drastic loss and a reason for DNC superdelegates).  ideology. They simply agree with Clinton's ideas more than Sanders somewhat related, or correllated, tribalism - Sanders ""isn't a real democrat!"". As a reminder, he technically wasn't - he was a self-described Socialist (technically elected as Independent) as far as party membership in Congress. ""Spoken like someone who has never been a member of the Democratic Party and has no understanding of what we do,"" (from DNC email dump) conservatism (as a psychological trait, not political philosophy). Sanders' brand of firebrand populism may not necessarily sit well with powerful establishment, who would prefer not to rock the boat too much as it could affect their own position. identity politics. Clinton was the female candidate, in the minds of some people preferable to any male candidate regardless of other considerations (ironically, those people would probably more naturally belong to progressive wing of DNC, but them's the breaks - I vaguely recall 538 reporting that something like 90% of women of color voted for Clinton). power politics. The Clintons represent a big power center; and people often support such power centers to benefit themselves. Or, people owed favors to Clintons, which is in the same general bucket. ""her turn"". While I'm unsure of how popular the concept was, there definitely people who felt that running strong in 2008 primaries ""entitled"" Clinton to a turn at the wheel. P.S. As an aside, the question's current phrasing makes an assumption that DNC prevented Sanders from getting the nomination. While this answer presents the plausible reasons for DNC to want to do so, I'm not actually aware of any ironclad proof that - despite some obvious efforts - DNC actually succeeded in that even assuming they uniformly wanted this (in other words, there needs to be tangible proof that without DNC efforts, Sanders would have won to make the assumption). 538 seems to have disagreed even early in the primaries. As well as much later."
Why do the United States openly acknowledge targeted assassinations?,"Quoting Biden: “The United States continues to demonstrate its resolve and capacity to defend Americans from those who seek to do it harm,” Biden said, making it “clear again [that] no matter how long it takes, no matter how you hide … the United States will find you and seek you out.” Deterrence only works if the people you are deterring know you are trying to deter them."
Why didn't Thatcher give Hong Kong to Taiwan?,"Other than the reasons of practicality mentioned, there is also the issue of international laws and treaties, specifically on the issue of ""successor states."" There definitely was some debate, as the situation in China is not considered a traditional succession of states scenario. But most legal scholars at the time agreed that the current ""government in Beijing"" (the PRC) is to be considered the legal successor to the original ""government in Beijing"" (The Qing dynasty) that Britain had signed the treaty with. Although Britain never ratified The Vienna Convention on Succession of States in respect of Treaties, to go against the advice of the both their own legal scholars and against international convention norms would have weakened Britain's clout significantly. Not to mention how hypocritical it would appear as Britain was in the process of negotiating for the protection of the rule of law in Hong Kong. There is also the consideration that in the early '80s when Thatcher's negotiations were taking place, Taiwan (ROC) would not have been considered a democratic, free country. It, like many of its Asian peers, and mainland China (PRC) itself, was under one-party rule at the time. Martial law, which had been in place for almost 40 years, wasn't lifted until 1987, and there was no opposition party until 1986. Although their societies have evolved along different political paths since, when Thatcher was holding negotiations, there certainly would have been reservations and no guarantees of how the rights of Hong Kong citizens would be treated by either the China (PRC) government or Taiwan (ROC) government."
Why shouldn't BBC have to register as a foreign agent?,"The relevant US law is the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which covers agents who act ""at the order, request, or under the direction or control"" of a foreign power. Therefore, institutional and editorial independence is the key. If the UK Prime Minister tells (say) an employee of MI6 or the Foreign Office to do something, that person is required to either do it or resign. This is not so for the BBC. Even during the Second World War, the BBC maintained its editorial independence; this was a deliberate policy, as it was believed the BBC would be more trusted if it was seen to be independent rather than a direct mouthpiece for government. Instead of comparing the BBC to agencies under direct government control, a better analogy would be a university. British universities receive most of their funding from central government; but the Prime Minister is unable to sack university professors at will, and the mere fact of being a professor at (say) Oxford University does not make a person an agent of the British government in any meaningful sense. Of course, both the BBC and Oxford University are part of the British establishment, and for cultural reasons will tend to reflect the establishment consensus; but that is a different matter from being agencies under the control of the government of the day."
"Has there been a non-trivial, stable, and functional anarchy?","No.  While it is hard to prove a negative, wherever two people come into conflict, either the stronger will come to dominate the weaker, or both will defer to an even stronger power, ie a government. Consider the usual examples of anarchist societies such as The Paris Commune, Nestor Makhno's ""free territory"" all had systems of government. These might be ""peasant councils"". Besides the Free territory only lasted 3 years, and the Paris commune only a few months. Local communes, like the Twin Oaks Community, are much smaller, but still have ""rules"" for dealing with conflict and are, of course, embedded into a country with a system of laws. You are not free to ""do what thy wilt"", you are expected to conform to the community standards and the laws of the land. Unintentional anarchies, such as parts of Somalia are actually a network of microstates with a baron or war lord ruling such a region as he is able (it usually is a ""he"") by the threat of force.  You have set a very high standard for ""stable anarchy"" and there are no examples where this standard has been met. There are various lists of anarchies online, but I think none meet your standard."
Have any other US presidents used that tiny table?,"That's known as a ""signing table"". Trump himself has used it before in 2017, and even joked about it himself. Or at least the audience laughed at his comments. While the seal seems to be a more recent addition, there's a very similarly looking table being used by Reagan... well, to actually sign documents.  President Reagan, Tom Lantos, Annette Lantos and Nina Lagergren at the signing ceremony in the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden for S.J. Resolution 65 ""The Wallenberg Resolution"" proclaiming Raoul Wallenberg a Swedish national to be an honorary citizen of the United States. 10/05/1981. Also indoors  President Reagan signing Voting Rights Act legislation with Bob Dole, Orrin Hatch, Bob Michel, Howard Baker, George Bush, William French Smith, Joseph Biden, Charles Mathias, Melvin Bradley and Thelma Duggin in East Room. 06/29/1982. Reagan's ""virtual library"" index of signing ceremonies has more photos with Reagan using it for the same purpose. One thing I've noticed in some (if not most) of the Reagan photos is that there's nearby lectern from which to give speeches afterwards. I guess the less usual thing in the Trump setups is giving speeches and/or press interviews from that table itself. G. W. Bush can also be seen using the table to sign a NATO accession protocol for some Eastern European countries. In that photo, the table has gained the seal.  (Video of the ceremony also shows a nearby lectern.) Interestingly, there are actually multiple copies of that table or at least very similarly looking ones at the White House, you can see two of them being used by Trump and Liu He, side-by-side.  Bill Clinton and Obama also used them (in individual ceremonies, at least).   And also Jimmy Carter (1977):  But I could not find evidence of Nixon or LBJ using that exact table (top) design, although they did use other tables of roughly the same size for signing ceremonies. (LBJ signing Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 and Nixon signing Older American Act Amendments of 1969.) 
 Hat tip to Darrel Hoffman for pointing out in a comment that Gerald Ford (who became president after Nixon resigned in 1974) did use the present design of the signing table. This is at a 1976 event.  Earlier signing ceremonies of Ford, e.g. one from 1974 have him using a different design though."
Paying people not to vote at all,"Some problems I can see with this idea: In point two, you claim that this system would encourage votes from people who ""understand the value of the vote"", but is that really true? Votes are very important in aggregate but a single vote, not so much - the overwhelmingly most likely outcomes of adding one vote are either 1) your preferred candidate wins by one more vote than they already would have, or 2) your preferred candidate loses by one fewer vote than they already would have. It is extremely unlikely that your vote will turn a tie into a win, or a win into a tie, and hence you are almost always better off taking the money. The (presumably small) payment is going to appear more tempting to a single parent on minimum wage than it is to a millionaire, leading to a skewed effect across the whole population. I also wouldn't rule out candidates trying to promote the payout amongst demographics likely to vote against them in order to benefit from the low turnout. In a democratic system, the winner wants to be able to point to the election results as evidence that the public supports their policies. Winning a plurality of the 10% of people who actually voted doesn't really show this. An obvious point, but you're going to need to pay a lot of people. Approximately one third of UK registered voters don't vote, and that number is sure to increase under your scheme. If we pay £10 each then that's over £150 million (and probably rising) per general election, more if we're also paying not to vote in local council elections and the like."
Is Japan still bound by the terms of its surrender in WWII?,"Yes Pacta sunt servanda, agreements must be kept. The Treaty of San Francisco is 70 years old which is young compared to many older treaties. Agreements have a few ""outs,"" neither of which are valid in Japan's case: Duress: Agreements signed under duress can sometimes be nullified. Japan could perhaps be said to be under duress from the United States. As any unconditional surrender is likely at least partially due to duress. But as far as I know, the duress argument does not work at all for state parties. Rebus sic stantibus: This is similar to the concept of force majeure. The state argues that unforeseen events have made the treaty inapplicable. However, this doctrine is seen as very limited in scope as it otherwise would make it very easy for states to escape from their obligations. Japan could perhaps argue that the nuclear armament of North Korea is such an unforeseen event.  I don't think that argument holds merit because Japan at the time of its unconditional surrender had already been bombed twice by nuclear weapons. Therefore, that a nearby power could acquire such weapons could not possibly qualify as a ""fundamental change of circumstances.""  Law of State Succession: If a state succeeds another, it is not necessarily bound by all treaties that the previous state signed. For example, after the 1917 Russian Revolution, the Soviet Union claimed that it was a new state, distinct from the Russian Empire, and that it therefore wasn't bound by the treaties that the previous state had signed.  Neither this out is applicable to Japan. It is clearly the same state as it was when the San Francisco treaty was signed. So yes, Japan is bound by the treaty. But the treaty text is open to interpretation.  Note that the relevant article of the Potsdam declaration reads: Japan shall be permitted to maintain such industries as will sustain her economy and permit the exaction of just reparations in kind, but not those which would enable her to rearm for war. This is the article Japan is bound to by international law. The Japanese constitution, on the other hand, states: Aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order, the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes. But articles of constitutions have no bearing on international law. They are better viewed as ""treaties"" between the state and the people of that state. Although it would certainly annoy their neighbors, Japan is free to do whatever it wants with its constitution as it is an entirely domestic matter."
Why do US police treat using counterfeit money as an emergency?,"The case of George Floyd is that he was accused of passing a counterfeit $20 Floyd allegedly used a counterfeit bill to buy cigarettes at the convenience store last week. The clerk reported it to police, a step that management described as store policy in Facebook posts.  In the US, most jurisdictions permit 911 calls for any active crime, regardless of the severity. The police then decide the urgency and severity of the response. While all jurisdictions have a non-emergency number, it's always a normal number. Some areas do not have a corresponding ""quick dial"" non-emergency number (like 311). That is the case here Operator: How can I help you?
Caller: Um someone comes our store and give us fake bills and we realize it before he left the store, and we ran back outside, they was sitting on their car. We tell them to give us their phone, put their (inaudible) thing back and everything and he was also drunk and everything and return to give us our cigarettes back and so he can, so he can go home but he doesn't want to do that, and he's sitting on his car cause he is awfully drunk and he's not in control of himself.  And at the end of the call Operator: Alright, I've got help on the way. If that vehicle or that person leaves before we get there, just give us a call back, otherwise we'll have squads out there shortly, okay?
Caller: No problem. The key line there is ""If that vehicle or that person leaves before we get there, just give us a call back, otherwise we'll have squads out there shortly, okay?"". Cars were sent, but it was likely a non-priority call (meaning a serious emergency like a shooting would likely have gotten those resources instead). We don't know what escalated this between the time the cars showed up and the time we see the video of him on the ground, pinned beneath an officer's knee (which lead to Floyd's death). Without that escalation, he likely would have been taken to the local precinct or jail, booked and jailed until a pretrial hearing for bail. Counterfeiting is a Federal crime and he likely would have been investigated by the Secret Service afterward. If charged, Federal prosecutors would have tried him in Federal court."
Why are gun restrictions based on terror watch list and mental health so controversial in the US?,"Americans hold that they have a right to bear arms.  This is codified in the Second Amendment to the Constitution (the first ten amendments are called the ""Bill of Rights"") A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. In general, the government is not allowed to restrict the rights of a particular person without due process of law.  There is no due process of law involved in being put on a watch list, and there is no due process to check whether you are on one and to appeal your placement.  (As of this answer, the only time the no fly list has actually been challenged in court it was found unconstitutional, so lawmakers may also want to overhaul the process itself before expanding its use, or get rid of it completely) In comparison, it is generally accepted in America that a person convicted of a felony loses their right to own guns even after they have served their sentence.  This is because, contrary to being put on a watch list, they were convicted of a crime in an open court, after being afforded their various rights around due process of law. To answer the question about the slippery slope, there is a camp of people whose primary motivation for upholding due process is that the people can use them to resist an authoritarian government.  However, the more general argument is simply that the government has no business taking away arms without due process of law.  The people have a right to have them, so the government does not have the power to arbitrarily take them away."
What did the Democrats have to gain by ousting Kevin McCarthy?,"Question #1 So it was really the Democrats who ousted McCarthy. Short Answer No, the Democrats weren't responsible but they did seem to enjoy the spectacle. Answer It was clearly the 8 out of 221 Republicans who ousted McCarthy. A Republican issued the vacate motion, triggering the floor vote. 8  Republicans denied him his party's majority support. His ousting falls on them, because without them Kevin McCarthy would still be speaker. The conservative news media know who's at fault. Rep. Matt Gaetz, Florida Republican and psycho killer, led the smallest caucus in Congress this week across the aisle and into the lap of Democrats. Other Media: The Democrats never voted for McCarthy in the first place; it's not a responsibility of the minority party to keep the majority's officers in place. Kevin McCarthy's position was always dependent on his party's majority, as is every speaker. Kevin McCarthy's majority was smaller and more fractured than most. His days were numbered the moment he allowed a motion to vacate rule with a single vote into the rules of his Congress. That was among the many conditions the Matt Gaetz / Jim Jordan faction wanted, and they always planned to use it. They said as much when they got it. Really, Kevin McCarthy has only himself to blame. In order to get the support of the ""Freedom Caucus"" initially, he had to buy them off, and in doing so he gave them the gun they used on him. He gave them important committee chairmanships, a pledge not to work across the aisle with Democrats, and the power to vacate his office over a single vote. These concessions gave the ""Freedom Caucus"" power which far exceeded their coalition's support and, it appears, competence. Kevin McCarthy needed to do that to get into the speakership, and once having done so he would never get to hold his office for very long. Question: What did the Democrats have to gain by ousting Kevin McCarthy? Short Answer When your opponent is shooting himself in the foot, don't interfere.
Loosely based on a 19th century Napoleon Quote. Answer The Democrats have a lot to gain. I guess the main thing the Democrats decided was, they could do better than Kevin McCarthy. a. Donald Trump was investigating Biden 4 years ago, which was what his first impeachment was about.  Manufacturing evidence against Biden. Impeachment inquiry transcripts reveal shock and concern over Trump plot Two senior American diplomats warned congressional investigators a White House plot to manufacture political dirt on Joe Biden in Ukraine had undermined US national security interests and shredded faith among foreign service personnel, according to transcripts released on Monday by committees pursuing an impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump. b. Speaker McCarthy at the beginning of 2023 authorized three important House committees to conduct nearly a 9 month investigation into Joe Biden. Each of which Found nothing. i.   House Oversight and Accountability Committee Republicans Fail to Find Any Evidence of Wrongdoing by President Biden in Floundering Biden Family Probe ii.  House Judiciary Committee Republican Congressman Accidentally Admits There’s No Proof of Biden Corruption Representative Nick Langworthy tried to defend Republicans’ Biden investigation, and ended up rejecting their main talking point instead. iii. Ways and Means Committee Republican congressman struggles to answer questions about allegations Biden influenced the Justice Department
Jason Smith, the Ways and Means Committee chair, was asked to explain how documents provided by his panel showed evidence of wrongdoing or a two-tiered justice system. c.  Sept 1, 2023, Speaker Kevin McCarthy pledges not to open impeachment inquiry without Congressional vote. McCarthy says he won’t open impeachment inquiry without House vote d.  Sept 12, 2023, Speaker McCarthy opens an impeachment inquiry on his own authority without Congressional approval Speaker McCarthy directs the House to open an impeachment inquiry into President Biden without a house vote With no evidence of any wrong doing turning up after 9 months of three important committee investigations into President Biden.  Kevin McCarthy in a bid to gain support from the Freedom Caucus decides to publicly announce an impeachment inquiry with no charges and give it to the same 3 Freedom Caucus chaired committees? Sept. 28, 2023, House GOP’s impeachment witnesses say there's no evidence yet that Biden committed a crime Conclusion:  House Democrats have reasons to believe Kevin McCarthy isn't someone they can work with.  That he is an political extremist ideologue / hack, demonstrated by their previous experiences with him.  That Democrats can hope for better. What else do Democrats get? Most Republicans supported Kevin McCarthy. Matt Gaetz and the other 7 Republicans who ousted Kevin McCarthy aren't all that popular now among their Republican peers. Jim Jordan, Matt's spiritual compass, is now running for speaker. I'm guessing the 200 Republicans who voted with Kevin McCarthy will not support Jim Jordan for speaker. So ultimately, the more mainstream Republicans will either have to get down on their knees and bow before the clown car wing of their party, which I think is unlikely, or they will propose a more acceptable option from their faction. Then the Democrats will support that guy. And he will probably need their support too, because the ""Freedom Caucus"" seems unwilling to compromise. So beyond someone better for the office, the Democrats now get to expose the dysfunction inside the Republican party, as we repeat the embarrassing 15 rounds of votes it took to place Kevin McCarthy in the speakership in the first place. Their demonstration will be: not only can't the Republicans perform the core function of governance, funding the government, they can't even elect their own leadership. Politico: The rudderless GOP careens toward 2024 Kevin McCarthy’s undoing underscores a bigger problem — the inability to govern itself — that risks imperilling the party’s chances in 2024. This time it might be longer than 15 rounds of votes to elect a new leader, as there is no consensus candidate among the Republican majority to start with. So the entire Republican majority will be tainted by a handful of over-empowered extremists, over and over and over again on world-wide TV. Remember it's likely that, after 5-10-15-20+ painful rounds of votes, it will still be the Democrats who will get to play the heroes and decide the next speaker. It's either that, or the ""Freedom Caucus"" would have to accept someone from the Republican majority, or the majority of Republicans will have to accept a freedom caucus member. Both rather unlikely near-term options. The Nail in Kevin McCarthy's Coffin Kevin McCarthy went on the Sunday morning talk shows after the Democrats helped him pass the 45 day continuing resolution on Saturday. On the shows, Kevin McCarthy blamed the Democrats for trying to defeat the continuing resolution. It was an unfathomable statement which even the shows' hosts protested, on air. 90 Republicans voted against the Saturday continuing resolution, 1 Democrat did so. I'm guessing Kevin McCarthy was trying to avoid the vacate motion which had not yet been issued by throwing the ""Freedom Caucus"" some red meat. Prior to deciding whether to support Kevin McCarthy in the vacate motion, Democrats played the tapes of these recent statements by Kevin McCarthy along with reviewing a long list of other grievances with the speaker. It was decided that the Democrats could do better than Kevin McCarthy. Kevin McCarthy's 'original sin': What drove the House speaker's historic downfall. Inside their closed-door meeting Tuesday (just before the vote to vacate), Democrats watched video of McCarthy’s interview Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” in which he trashed their party as having egged on a shutdown, even though it provided the bulk of votes to keep the government open. Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., called it “a huge misstep” that clarified the thinking of fence-sitting Democrats. “One of the most stupid things somebody could do on the eve of your survival vote,” he said. From Comments: Can we stop with the clown car analogy? Clowns are neither incompetent nor evil, the GOP is both. The analogy is definitely present. I thought about removing that, but they aren't my words. Those are the words newspapers, journalists and Congressmen, including GOP congressmen are using to describe the GOP.  That expression is part of the story. Congress isn't going to get anything done until the GOP works this out. They aren't going to work it out until they realize how much damage they're doing to themselves. At least we're not backed up against defaulting on the national debt like we were last time they tried to shutdown the government, that was the scary clown with a knife to the throat of the nation. Shutting down the government now, while political suicide prior to the 2024 election, it's not akin to defaulting on the national debt."
"Why is a big country less suitable for high-tax, high-welfare system?","Caveat: These are impressions of a Scandinavian dude (assuming you would include Finland) who only lived in the US (in late 80's) as a grad student/post doc, but never raised a family there. I would say that the question is more complicated than just a matter of size. The scale may affect the viability of a welfare system financed by we the taxpayers, but not necessarily in a direct way.  Ok, so I just kept stating the obvious. Back to the actual question."
"Isn't acknowledging the existence of God, as a state, a contradiction of the separation of Church and State?","No, it isn't a contradiction under US law.   This has been tested in the Federal Courts, see for example O'Hair v. Blumenthal, and Aronow v. United States. The basic reasoning is summarized in this paragraph from the Anonow case: It is quite obvious that the national motto and the slogan on coinage and currency ""In God We Trust"" has nothing whatsoever to do with the establishment of religion. Its use is of a patriotic or ceremonial character and bears no true resemblance to a governmental sponsorship of a religious exercise. Religion and the government have a lengthy history in the U.S.   Thomas Jefferson's position was that no man should be compelled to support religion, but that all men should be free to profess their opinions in matters of religion.  In context of today's politics and law, the profession of God in those contexts isn't compelling religion, but fits closer the freedom Jefferson described.  In the US today, it is optional. So, U.S. presidents have never been required to add ""So help me God"" to their oath, but it became a tradition.  Some U.S. state constitutions required it, and that wasn't viewed as a conflict in 1776, but the law evolved, and in 1961 the Supreme Court ruled against a state constitution that compelled the words ""So help me God"" in a state oath of office.  The Supreme Court ruled compelling this unconstitutional and unenforceable but did not make optional words illegal.    Thomas Jefferson avoided the word God in official context, but professed in words of his own ending his first inaugural address: And may that infinite power, which rules the destinies of the universe, lead our councils to what is best, and give them a favorable issue for your peace and prosperity."
What is this line of counties voting for the Democratic party in the 2016 elections?,"What first appeared to be a long unbroken line of counties from north to south actually seems to be made of two major parts. 
2016 elections[8] The blue counties north of Virginia are actually part of a larger area that also skirts the Great Lakes. The reasons why Northeastern United States votes Democrat (or used to) are complex and changing (it was mostly Republican before 1990), but it is unrelated to the rest of the curve. The emergence of the Northeast as a potential Democratic firewall has been a long time in the making. The steady realignment of the South toward the Republicans, which rendered the party increasingly conservative, called forth a counter-realignment among moderates in the North.[11] The voting patterns of the Northeastern region would require an answer of its own, but it is related to population density, education, urban centers and social and cultural differences between the North and South. However, this answer mainly focuses on the Black Belt. The southern part of the ""curve"" is commonly called the ""Black Belt"": There’s an arc of Democratic strength across the interior South. This is the old “Black Belt,” named for the fertile soil that gave rise to cotton plantations. These areas are still populated by a high percentage of African-Americans even 150 years after the end of slavery, and they’re predominantly Democratic today.[1] 
Black population by county[3] The soil of the Southeastern regions is fertile and well-drained, making it ideal for cotton. The black population in this region today descends from the slaves that use to work the cotton fields. Over time this rich soil produced an amazingly productive agricultural region, especially for cotton.  In 1859 alone a harvest of over 4,000 cotton bales was not uncommon within the belt. And yet, just tens of miles north or south this harvest was rare.  Of course this level of cotton production required extensive labor. As Washington notes further in his autobiography, ""The part of the country possessing this thick, dark, and naturally rich soil was, of course, the part of the South where the slaves were most profitable, and consequently they were taken there in the largest numbers. Later and especially since the war, the term seems to be used wholly in a political sense—that is, to designate the counties where the black people outnumber the white.""[2] I went back to previous elections and found that the ""blue Black Belt"" has been present in many of them. 
2000 elections[4] 
1984 elections[5] However, as you go further back, the belt disappears from maps because African-Americans often didn't (or couldn't) vote: But the Black Belt has not always been visible on maps during elections.  The Voting Rights Act, outlawing discriminatory voting practices, was passed in 1965.  As result, a year earlier in the 1964 elections larger numbers of African Americans were excluded from the polls in Southern states.  And, in turn, the blue band we see today was not visible.[2] 
1924 elections[6], note the uniform blue color across the South (for the red/blue swap, see the Southern Realignment or the Southern strategy) Before 1948, there was no clear distinction in party identification for African-Americans, although ""at no point from 1936 on, according to Joint Center data, has the Republican candidate for president gotten more than 40 percent of the black vote.""[7] 
Black party identification[7] There are two major bumps in party identification: 1948 and 1964. In 1948, Democrat Harry Truman talked about civil rights in his state of the union address: Today, however, some of our citizens are still denied equal opportunity for education, for jobs and economic advancement, and for the expression of their views at the polls. Most serious of all, some are denied equal protection under the laws. Whether discrimination is based on race, or creed, or color, or land of origin, it is utterly contrary to American ideals of democracy.[10] This was followed by requests to Congress about, among other things, protecting the right to vote.[9] The second bump in 1964 was the Civil Rights Act by Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson. This Act would outlaw discrimination based on race and color and ""ended unequal application of voter registration requirements"". Although these two actions would strengthen the black vote for the Democratic Party, it would also make them mostly unelectable in the Deep South: When he signed the bill, President Lyndon Johnson reportedly said that Democrats would, as a result, lose the South for a generation. It's been longer than that.[7] [1] What This 2012 Map Tells Us About America, and the Election, Nate Cohn and Toni Monkovic, 18 October 2016, The New York Times

Can the UK realistically back out of Brexit?,"On 2018-12-10, the European Court of Justice decided that the UK can withdraw from the process of leaving the EU, without requiring the other members’ consent, until either an agreement has been finalized or the two-year term since invocation of article 50 has passed. This was my old answer as of 2017-12-14 (addressing the first version of the question, before it was clarified to be about internal UK dynamics only): From a legal point of view, it is not clear whether the UK could or could not unilaterally retract its invocation of article 50 (i.e. despite opposition from the other member states). The article is rather vague and doesn’t address special cases. Allegedly, unnamed “top legal experts” have advised the UK government that it is possible, while the government’s public position is that it is not; this latter view is again supported by other legal experts (example). In the end, the question would be for the Court of Justice of the European Union to decide. On the other hand, it seems clear that, under article 50, the UK and the 27 other states could unanimously decide to stop the Brexit process and let the UK remain a member. It is conceivable that some of the member states might give their consent only in exchange for certain concessions from the UK; e.g., regarding the UK’s “Thatcher rebate” or the status of Gibraltar."
When is a democratic vote actually the wrong tool?,"Democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch. ~ a quote commonly attributed to Benjamin Franklin So, to answer your question: When is a democratic vote actually the wrong tool? Any time the rights of minorities matter. Pure democracy is mob rule. That's one reason the United States is not a pure democracy. It's a constitutional representative democracy and a federal republic. This means, among other things, that: Democracy may also be inadequate when a faster speed of decision-making is important. Examples include: Reference:"
Why has Donald Trump's popularity remained so stable over a rather long period of time?,"It's actually surprisingly hard to find surveys that also ask the ""why"" question of the supporters. I did find one on-line survey by ""SurveyMonkey"", although I'm not sure of its reliability; even the date is unclear. It used open ended questions.   a large majority of Republicans (85%) approve of the job Trump is doing as president. When asked why, they highlight that he has “kept promises” made during the campaign, “put America first,” “tried to get things done,” and “reversed the last eight years” of Obama administration policies. Many respondents cite specific campaign slogans (“MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” in some form or another is used by about 8% of all respondents) in their responses. As the chart above shows, college grads tend to zero in on more tangible goals (top mentioned topic was “reduced regulations”) whereas those without college degrees focus on vaguer ambitions like “making America great again.” Many college grads applaud Trump for “reinvigorating the economy” by removing “intrusive” regulations on business that do more harm than good. This group also advocates another time-tested Trumpism: “Draining the Swamp.” However, the college grads who cited this reason for approving of Trump also acknowledged that while Trump is “trying” to drain the swamp and accomplish his other campaign promises, he is “being blocked by others,” including both Democrats and members of his own party. One topic that emerged equally from non-college grads and college grads was the feeling that while Trump has “good positions,” he also has a “flawed personality” that does not lend itself to effective communicating or strategizing. On the other hand, those with less than a college degree praise Trump using some of his more amorphous campaign slogans: “Making America Great Again” and “Putting America First.” These supporters also appreciate Trump for his plain-speaking (“Tells it like it is”) and for the fact that he is “doing his best” despite facing adversity. There is one Pew ""thermometer"" survey of Trump supporters, which does seem to show that Trump has not disappointed much his base, and on the contrary those who voted for him while being skeptical have warmed up to Trump in the aftermath. It's harder to say why this happened, just from that survey. Where they happy with his policies, and which ones in particular? Or has he become more likeable for another, less direct reason, like the economy doing well? (Of course Trump draws a direct and immediate connection between the two, but let's not get into that here. In general a US president's approval rating is tied to the stock market.)  Fivethirtyeight has managed to point to one event that apparently did impact (or at least correlated) with a noticeable change in Trump's approval, namely the government shutdown from last winter. But after that shutdown ended, Trump's rating recovered and has been more or less stable since.  So from that at least it looks like there was not much popular reaction to the Mueller report this spring. (That article is from Sep 13, so before the Ukraine/impeachment event, it's probably too early to tell how [much] this is going to affect Trump approval.) Another interesting issue is that Trump's approval rating is ""underperforming"" the popular perception of the economy (doing well). In contrast, there was a narrower difference between Obama's approval rating and the perception of the economy in his time. But Trump's approval rating just on his ""handling"" of the economy is actually better than his overall job approval rating. Finally, there are a lot of papers that try to profile his supporters in one aspect or another, but that's perhaps too long to go over here. But out of all that work, I did like a 2017 study that identified/clustered four major profiles for Trump voters. You can use their priorities expressed in the graph below to cross-check how some of Trump's later executive actions satisfied one group or another in this electoral alliance of sorts. E.g. tax cuts satisfied some groups, deportations satisfied others, and Trump's climate-change position(s) apparently satisfied all. (Alas there's no follow-up study, like for example determining for each of these groups how much they liked Trump then and now/later.) "
Has there ever been an independence movement with the goal to split off an underperforming part of a nation?,"An example I could think of is Singapore. The country became independent from Malaysia after the Malaysian Parliament voted to expel Singapore, due to a combination of racial, economic and political tensions (Wikipedia has a relatively informative article regarding this). This came two years after a union was formed between Malaysia and Singapore (both Singapore and Malaysia were British colonies before). From the country's Library Board: On 9 August 1965, Singapore separated from Malaysia to become an independent and sovereign state.3 The separation was the result of deep political and economic differences between the ruling parties of Singapore and Malaysia,3 which created communal tensions that resulted in racial riots in July and September 1964.3 [ ... ] Although all signs were pointing to trouble, very few were prepared for the dramatic end to Singapore’s union with Malaysia. From the BBC: In 1965, Singapore was forced to leave the Malaysian Federation. Manjit remembers seeing the prime minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, cry during an interview. ""We'd go to our neighbours' house and watch TV and we saw him crying and we didn't know why."" It was a traumatic beginning to independence. Many believed Singapore could not survive on its own. But with huge hopes for the future, Singapore began to build the infrastructure that would transform the city. At that time, Singapore was one of the ""poorest countries in the world"" and its transformation to its current success has sometimes been dubbed the ""Singapore miracle"". From The Huffington Post: When Singapore was expelled from Malaysia in 1965 and thrust into an unwanted independence, it was a typical Third World country. Its per capita income of $500 was the same as Ghana’s then. It was not desperately poor, but it had malnutrition."
What reasons may Donald Trump have had for firing FBI Director James Comey?,"The reason given publicly by members of the Trump administration was that Comey was dismissed due to the way he handled the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server. The Director was wrong to usurp the Attorney General's authority on July 5, 2016, and announce his conclusion that the case should be closed without prosecution. It is not the function of the Director to make such an announcement. At most, the Director should have said the FBI had completed its investigation and presented its findings to federal prosecutors. The Director now defends his decision by asserting that he believed Attorney General Loretta Lynch had a conflict. But the FBI Director is never empowered to supplant federal prosecutors and assume command of the Justice Department. There is a well-established process for other officials to step in when a conflict requires the recusal of the Attorney General. On July 5, however, the Director announced his own conclusions about the nation's most sensitive criminal investigation, without authorization of duly appointed Justice Department leaders. (emphasis mine) There's a question regarding this and the answers there goes into detail on what was wrong with how he handled the investigation. However, the timing of the dismissal raised some questions among Democratic and even some Republicans lawmakers. According to an article by CNN: And in a sign of possible trouble for the administration, Republican Sen. Richard Burr, who is leading a Senate intelligence committee probe into alleged Russian influence on the election, expressed disquiet at the firing of Comey, which he described as a ""loss for the bureau and the nation. ""I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Director Comey's termination. I have found Director Comey to be a public servant of the highest order, and his dismissal further confuses an already difficult investigation by the Committee,"" Burr said. (emphasis mine) And an article by The Atlantic: Comey’s dismissal is likely to raise questions about whether the White House is interfering in that investigation. In a letter from Trump informing Comey of his firing, the president suggested Comey had privately assured Trump he was not being scrutinized. “While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgement of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau,” Trump said. (emphasis mine) Due to the timing, some have suggested that the White House has interfered with the investigation into a possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign due to the timing of the firing. However, this is just a likely reason that's reported. Comey recently confirmed during a testimony before the House Intelligence Committee that the FBI is investigating whether members of President Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign colluded with Russia to influence the election. As President Trump repeatedly denounced the Russia story as “fake news.”, he might have fired Comey so that he could appoint a new FBI director to lead the investigation. Second, Comey and his department have been investigating ties between the Russian government and the Trump camp for months. The investigation seems serious. Trump has now fired a man who was a major potential threat to his presidency. (emphasis mine) Source: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-did-trump-fire-comey/ Most recently, he denounced the investigation in a tweet less than 24 hours before dismissing Comey:  Another reason this reason might be possible is that Trump briefly mentioned the investigation in his letter to Comey and seemingly tried to hint that it wasn't the factor: While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau. However, the Trump administration has denied it: The FBI has been investigating allegations that people involved with Trump's presidential campaign had undisclosed ties to Russia. But during a brief meeting with NBC News in the Oval Office on Tuesday evening, Trump said the Russia probe wasn't a factor in his decision. (emphasis mine) Some articles worth checking out:"
How can the influence of wealthy individuals on democratic processes be reduced?,"Many countries adopt some variant of solution (3): Putting restrictions to the usage of wealth in political situations. This solution is used in many western states, but is of course a violation of free speech and the possibility to exercise political influence at will. The assumption ""of course this is a violation of free speech"" is not universally shared. US courts have recently taken a broad interpretation of the First Amendment, which holds that spending money is a form of ""speech"" and therefore has strong constitutional protection. As a result, there is little or no restriction on spending in US elections.  Important caveats: Victory does not always go to the best funded campaign: In 2016 Clinton outspent Trump by approximately $500 million. It is possible that in the future, the US Supreme Court will take a less absolutist stance on political funding, opening the door to renewed attempts at campaign finance reform. The UK is a capitalist society with freedom of expression. A wealthy person is free to own one or more newspapers and use them to promote his or her views, and several billionaires do exactly that. On the other hand: The UK has very tight regulations for spending on election campaigns, with maximum spending limits on both individual races and the overall campaign. Broadcasting is also heavily regulated, with most political advertising disallowed, and strict rules for impartiality of election coverage. Other countries take their own approaches. For example Germany has no limits on campaign spending, but also has strict rules on transparency, and generous public funding of political parties in order to level the playing field. No right is absolute. A wealthy person has the right to spend money; but other citizens, individually or collectively, may decide certain things are not for sale."
Has a world leader been laughed at while addressing the UN General Assembly before?,"Yes, it has happened before. The following excerpt is from a France 24 article: Light moments are exceedingly unusual in the UN General Assembly, which follows a strict protocol in with [sic] each world leader is escorted to the rostrum for an address on issues of the day. In 2015, Zimbabwe's then 91-year-old strongman Robert Mugabe was met with laughter when he shouted ""We are not gays!,"" part of his longstanding insistence that homosexuality is non-African."
Why is it a bad idea to hire a hitman to eliminate most corrupt politicians?,"Basically because your idea (assassination of corrupt politician) undermines rather than reinforces the rule of law. Usually the definition of corruption includes some kind of illegal activity. Otherwise it's just stuff you don't like for personal moral reasons. And if everyone started to use assasination to solve their moral differences... the basis of the (modern) state as the sole authority for violence would cease to exist. And given that it's apparently a fairly popular idea, in some movies at least, here's some similar commentary on the idea: The violence could worsen the problem of corruption,” says Michael Johnston, a political scientist and professor at Colgate University. “It would legitimate violent action from the persecuted politicians, and encourage a hunt for the suspects. That is what will happen with Rodrigo Duterte’s tactics in the Philippines,” he explains, referring to the Philippine president who wishes to distribute 42 thousand weapons to ordinary citizens, especially community leaders, so they can go around the country killing people involved with any form of illicit activities, especially drug trafficking. In such a scenario, a climate similar to that of Joseph Stalin’s Soviet Union would be implemented: any accusation, no matter how little justified by concrete evidence, would mean a death penalty or exile. And the dead corrupt politicians would quickly be replaced by other ones – as it already happens with members of the organized crime. And since that part doesn't get developed with any examples there, South Africa is perhaps an example where the whistleblowers are the ones that usually end up assassinated, nowadays. Political assassinations are rising sharply in South Africa, threatening the stability of hard-hit parts of the country and imperiling Mr. Mandela’s dream of a unified, democratic nation. But unlike much of the political violence that upended the country in the 1990s, the recent killings are not being driven by vicious battles between rival political parties. Quite the opposite: In most cases, A.N.C. officials are killing one another, hiring professional hit men to eliminate fellow party members in an all-or-nothing fight over money, turf and power, A.N.C. officials say. [...] The recent assassinations cover a wide range of personal and political feuds. Some victims were A.N.C. officials who became targets after exposing or denouncing corruption within the party. Others fell in internal battles for lucrative posts. Encouraging assassination as a legitimate political tool can easily lead to that since who has more money to pay hitmen? And to reinforce this idea, going back to Duterte, here's a quote from him: Rodrigo Duterte has warned journalists in the Philippines that they are legitimate targets for assassination if they do wrong, in the President-elect’s latest controversial comments ahead of being sworn into office later this month. Duterte was asked during a press conference Tuesday how he would address the country’s high murder rate for journalists, reports Agence France-Presse. “Just because you’re a journalist you are not exempted from assassination, if you’re a son of a bitch,” he replied. Interestingly, Duterte was apparently referring to (or perhaps reducing the problem to) the rather complex case of Jun Pala, who apparently himself was linked to a vigilante group that exposed and allegedly assassinated some [corrupt] politicians. And since this came up several times in the comments, here's a definition(s) primer: “Corruption” is a term whose meaning shifts with the speaker. It can describe the
corruption of the young from watching violence on television or refer to political
decisions that provide narrow benefits to one’s constituents in the form, say, of a new
road through the district. In short, speakers use the term to cover a range of actions that
they find undesirable. Because my topic includes both corruption and poor governance, I
omit both morally corrupting activities, on the one hand, and run-of-the-mill
constituency-based politics, on the other. I use the common definition of corruption as the
“misuse of public power for private or political gain,” recognizing that “misuse” must be
defined in terms of some standard. Many corrupt activities under this definition are illegal
in most countries—for example, paying and receiving bribes, fraud, embezzlement, self-dealing, conflicts of interest, and providing a quid pro quo in return for campaign gifts.
However, part of the policy debate turns on where to draw the legal line and how to
control borderline phenomena, such as conflicts of interest, which many political systems
fail to regulate. [...] one of the most important debates turns on the issue
of “state capture” or the problem of creating open democratic/market societies in states
where a narrow elite has a disproportionate influence on state policy. In those countries
outright bribery may be low, but the system is riddled with special interest deals that
favor the few over the many. In some sense, plain-old tyranny (which several comments addressed) is an extreme form of state capture. (When there aren't even pretenses anymore.)
State capture is of course somewhat different than ""conventional"" corruption because there's (usually widespread) institutional and legislative failure. Whether peaceful reform or violent revolution is the appropriate solution for such a state of affairs is a somewhat related but sufficiently different question, so I won't attempt to address that here."
What are the objections to Mitch McConnell's COVID-19 Bill?,"Democrats have been trying to make the case that the stimulus package contains within it a corporate ""slush fund"" controlled by the Treasury Department and headed by Steve Mnuchin, and Democrats believe there is a high risk of mismanagement or outright corruption. From NYMag: The central flash point concerns a $500 billion corporate bailout. [...] 
  Its requirements that bailed-out firms protect their workers are too weak. (Protecting the workers is the whole rationale for bailing them out, after all — at least from the Democrats’ point of view.) More disturbing, it’s designed as a pool of money to be doled out by the Treasury secretary. That is to say, the money is, for all intents and purposes, personally controlled by Donald Trump, who selected the Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, and could replace him on a whim. [...]
  One obvious outcome of this financing arrangement would be to create the all-but-certain outcome that the Treasury would select the Trump Organization as one of the worthy recipients of its largesse. Trump’s vacation properties have indeed been forced to shut down, and while an unbiased manager might not select the Trump Organization over needier coronavirus victims, Trump himself probably thinks differently. Indeed, at his press conference, the president did not even bring himself to deny that he might. “Let’s just see what happens,” he replied, as if the outcome might contain any mystery. They also make the argument that the restrictions on the bailout fund that are in place to prevent some of the excesses by executives after the bailout of 2008 are weak, as are protections for workers who become unemployed. From Politico: According to a senior Democratic aide, the party's concerns with the GOP proposal center on $500 billion for corporations; stock buyback language that can be waived by the Treasury secretary; only a two-year time frame on executive compensation limits; and no provisions to protect individuals from eviction. [...] Democrats also object to what they say is an insufficient amount of money for state and local governments and providing only three months of unemployment insurance. Democrats initially asked for $750 billion in state aid, and Republicans have countered with far less. A further complication for the bill is the behavior by many of these firms and how they chose to spend money saved by the GOP tax cut. Instead of using that money to create rainy day funds, they instead used that money to repurchase stock in order to inflate executive compensation to the detriment of their workers."
Exit strategies for the Ukraine war,"This seems to naturally lead to case-fire negotiations that would determine a ""line of actual control"" close to an eventual realistic military outcome but save thousands of lives, let alone property and resources. Not really, not at this time, not yet. Wars don't get started because both countries know the endpoint, they get started because each country thinks it can get what it wants and it takes a loss to convince the loser to concede. War on Rocks podcast, shortly after the shift of offensive from Kiev area to Donbas put it nicely:  at this point, both parties believe they can manipulate the situation to their advantage and it will take military (or economic) losses to convince them otherwise. Russia's desire to control zones of Donbas beyond where they were on February 23rd goes beyond what Ukraine has said it is willing to negotiate about. Putin thinks, or at least thought 3 weeks ago, that Russia can take over the Donbas by running a more disciplined military operation in the East.  The Russian people have little say.  Zelensky believes Ukraine can kick them out, or at least hold the line, and has popular support. These are not reconcilable positions, at this point.  One, or both, will have to make concessions they are not yet willing to make and those concessions won't happen until the current fighting goes one way or the other. Even then, it is not hard to imagine Russia settling in for a static conflict akin to what they did in Donbas since 2014 - trenches with artillery exchanges.  And then that just becomes the new decision point:  how much does it cost in lives and economically on either side. Asking one or the other to ""give things up"" is rather glib and not all that realistic. For Ukraine, losing territory is about the worst outcome a nation can get in warfare.  Add to it that, for Ukrainians currently in Russian-occupied territories the behavior of Russian troops and authorities seems too abusive to dismiss as a simple exchange of territory.  Bucha has made a negotiated settlement much harder for Zelenksy. For Russia, the situation is no easier:  Putin could easily pull out, except that he's staked his entire political house of cards on reinvigorating Russian power and prestige. Both countries are still in the process of discovering what they, and the other, can or can not, do.  For example, Ukraine claimed - either  for propaganda or out of genuine belief - that the May 9th parade would see Putin either declare war or mobilization.  That did not happen.  As per ISW: Russian President Vladimir Putin used his May 9 speech to praise ongoing Russian efforts in Ukraine and reinforce existing Kremlin framing rather than announcing a change. He did not announce an escalation or declare victory in the Russian war in Ukraine. Putin likely calculated that he could not ask the Russian population for a greater commitment to the war effort and implicitly reassured the Russian people that he would not ask for a greater societal commitment in his speech. Putin may be recognizing the growing risks he faces at home and in Ukraine and may be adjusting his objectives, and his desired end state in Ukraine, accordingly. The Kremlin has already scaled down its objectives in Ukraine (from its initial objective of capturing Kyiv and full regime change) and will likely do so again—or be forced to do so by Ukrainian battlefield successes. Regardless of any change—or lack thereof—in the Kremlin's objectives, Putin’s speech indicates that the Kremlin has likely decided to maintain its current level of resourcing in the war. To go back to the question: For weeks now the war has appeared to drag on with protracted fighting and a slow-moving front. Yes, that's also part of the ""learning process"" for both sides. So, while there are plenty of possible exit strategies for the war, it is unlikely that they will be pursued until considerably more pain is suffered by both sides and one side is convinced they can't achieve their goals. p.s. It would be remiss not to mention ISW's latest (May 13th) take on Putin's exit strategy, RUSSIAN ANNEXATION OF OCCUPIED UKRAINE IS PUTIN’S UNACCEPTABLE “OFF-RAMP” It's a doozy: annex already-conquered Ukrainian territories into Russia declare that Ukrainian attacks to recover those areas are violating Russian home territory and liable for nuclear retaliation. Four months ago, despite a long dislike of Putin, I would have rolled my eyes at this blatantly unjustified trolling of Russia.  Now I am hoping that ISW is wrong but by no means putting it beneath them.  The interesting spin here is ISW's claim that Russia recognizing it can't win militarily would be precisely what would cause it to do this, to lock in their territorial robbery."
How did Russia retain the UNSC veto power of the Soviet Union?,"Essentially, you got a permanent seat on the Security Council if you were one of the major powers who won WW2 and went about setting up the post-war peace organisation, i.e the United Nations. When the Soviet Union (which was a union of multiple soviet republics) dissolved, Russia claimed itself as the successor state on the grounds it contained 51% of the population and 77% of the territory of the Soviet Union. They thus agreed to inherit all international treaties and responsibilities of the Soviet Union and were internationally recognised as such. As such, it was perfectly legitimate for them to inherit the seat on the Security Council. A similar example might be if Scotland had left the UK, the remaining state would not have lost its permanent seat.  As the UN says in this article All international agreements, such as those governing membership of the UN Security Council, relate to a nation as a legal entity. Even if that nation changes it name, has a part of it split off and declare independence, or undergoes a revolution or any other form of change of government, that nation is still considered to be the same legal entity. It is still bound by all the same laws and treaties as before and it still enjoys the same statuses as before. The article goes on to say ...when the USSR broke up in 1991 Russia successfully argued that it should be recognised as the continuing state and so it inherited, among other things, the USSR’s permanent seat on the Security Council. This is partially because Russia received the backing of lots of the other former soviet states to remain as the successor state.  Russia inherited all the Soviet Union's assets and also its foreign debt of US$70bn."
What do people who oppose Dr. Anthony Fauci believe he did wrong?,"I'll go over some of the claims, from least egregious / least crazy to most egregious / craziest. Note well: I do not ascribe to these crazy views. Claim: Dr. Fauci lied about the efficacy of masks at the start of the pandemic and then switched lies to how efficacious masks were. There might be something to this claim as masks were in very short supply at the onset of the pandemic and the medical community wanted to have first responders getting first dibs to that short supply. Claim: The US funded one of the organizations that were involved in researching corona viruses at the Wuhan institute, that Dr. Fauci knew about this funding, and covered it up. This is partly true. The US funds lots of medical research done outside of the US, and one of them did work with the Wuhan institute. Claim: Dr. Fauci lied about the nature of the disease. It was instead a variant of the common cold. It is true that some of the many viruses that cause the common cold are corona viruses. It is not true that COVID-19 is only as harmful as are typical common cold viruses. The best way to tell a lie is to tell a partial truth. Dr. Fauci did not lie about the terrible nature of COVID-19.. Claim: Dr. Fauci lied about the origin of COVID-19 (version 1). He knew that COVID-19 originated as a lab leak in Wuhan and Dr. Fauci hid this knowledge. We do not know if COVID-19 originated from a lab leak or some other mechanism such as a cross-species infection that crossed to humanity at a Wuhan market. (Natural origin and cross-species infection is widely regarded as the most likely explanation.) Claim: Dr. Fauci lied about the origin of COVID-19 (version 2). He knew that China intentionally released the virus responsible for COVID-19 virus as a biological weapon. As in version 1 of this claim, Dr. Fauci knew about this and hid this knowledge. This one is ludicrous. Claim: Dr. Fauci lied about the origin of COVID-19 (version 3). COVID-19 was neither a lab leak nor a biological weapon released by China. It was instead a biological weapon intentionally released by the US during a trip to China. As in version 1 and version 2 of this claim, Dr. Fauci knew about this and hid this knowledge. Moreover, Hilary Clinton was directly involved in this intentional release. (Don't ask me how.) This one is beyond ludicrous. Claim: The COVID-19 vaccines contain micro receivers by which the federal government will control our brains, will make us accept gay marriage, will make us reject Christmas, and will make us vote for Democrats for the rest of our lives. And, of course, Dr. Fauci knew all about this. Beyond ludicrous is not strong enough to describe this level of craziness. Note well: I do not ascribe to the crazy views. Please don't kill the messenger. These crazy views are out there, and some members of Congress subscribe to them."
Does the United States guarantee any unique freedoms?,"The Third Amendment to the United States Constitution is a pretty good candidate: No Soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without
  the consent of the Owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be
  prescribed by law. The word ""quartered"" in this context means ""giving a place to stay"" (i.e. room and board), most likely at the owner's expense. So the Third Amendment guarantees the freedom to not have the government send peacetime soldiers to live in your house without your consent, nor wartime soldiers to live in your house unless an explicit law says otherwise. I imagine this right is effectively in place in many other countries, but without the prominence of being explicitly enumerated in their constitutions."
What does it mean for Russia to put its nuclear deterrence forces on ‘high alert’?,"Very hard to say what the actual changes are without looking at the specifics of Russian nuclear protocols (which nuclear countries do not generally share much, preferring to remain ambiguous). Russia's forces, like US ones, are capable of reacting to a first strike and thus are capable of operation without being ""warmed up"".  This is true for ICBMs and SLBMS (sub-launched). However, at the political level, it is very clear what message is intended:  ""Russia is a nuclear state and don't you forget it"".  Nuclear alert levels were a ritualized signaling mechanism during the Cold War.  Like a dog growling and raising its hackles it is meant to signal that it might bite.  Not that it will bite, but that it wants you to know it is ready to (this is akin to moving the US's DEFCON levels, as Fluidcode points out) Nuclear war is so dangerous that it is critically important to have a variety of signals to indicate intents and especially the level of threat you perceive from others or want to signal to others.  Alert levels are part of that. What it's not is an indication that Russian forces are prepping for launching a strike. Those wouldn't be broadcast in advance. Most nuclear forces have been ""off-alert"", for whatever actual meaning that has, since the end of the Cold War.  This is a spike back up. If you go back earlier in time in the Cold War, nuclear readiness was more gradual and had actual meanings, with aircraft needing to be loaded and possibly being put on station near the enemy territory.  Earlier Soviet ICBMs were liquid-fuelled and needed considerable prep before being ready for launch.  This is not the case anymore however.  You do probably have things like bases being locked down and personnel being pulled back from leave. Putin already reminded us that Russia is a nuclear state in his original speeches on the 23rd. At one level, this is, usefully, reminding the more gung-ho of Western politicians that ""boots on the ground"" or engaging NATO air forces directly over Ukraine is a non-starter.  What got us out of the Cold War in one piece is never to risk direct NATO-Russia combat. This something Biden, correctly, identified back when he advised US citizens to leave. Biden made the remarks in an interview with NBC News' Lester Holt, who asked him what kind of scenarios would prompt a U.S. rescue mission, if Russia invaded. ""There's not [one],"" Biden said. ""That's a world war — when Americans and Russians start shooting at one another, we're in a very different world than we've ever been in."" At another level, Putin would no doubt be thrilled if the West stopped supporting Ukraine altogether because the more timid amongst our politicians lost their resolve.  However, this risks being another miscalculation - whatever Russia can do to NATO, NATO can do to Russia and Putin is losing world sympathy by the day with his antics.  China, for one, would be horribly impacted if Putin managed to trigger a full on war.  MAD is just as suicidal to all parties now as it was 30 years ago. To give an example of nuclear alertness level influencing a crisis, Israel loaded their nukes during the early days of the Yom Kippur War, when they were not doing well.  And the US, which before had dragged its feet on helping them, immediately flooded them with military aid. Or during the Cuban Missile Crisis: US alert level raised Adlai Stevenson shows aerial photos of Cuban missiles to the United Nations, October 25, 1962.
The US requested an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council on October 25. US Ambassador to the United Nations Adlai Stevenson confronted Soviet Ambassador Valerian Zorin in an emergency meeting of the Security Council, challenging him to admit the existence of the missiles. Ambassador Zorin refused to answer. The next day at 10:00 pm EDT, the US raised the readiness level of SAC forces to DEFCON 2. For the only confirmed time in US history, B-52 bombers went on continuous airborne alert, and B-47 medium bombers were dispersed to various military and civilian airfields and made ready to take off, fully equipped, on 15 minutes' notice. Further readings: Alert  Status  of  Nuclear Weapons - Federation    of  American    Scientists Despite   concern about   realerting  effect, both
US  and Russian escalation  strategies  rely    on
significant realerting  to  signal  and boost
nuclear postures in a crisis. Alert status of nuclear weapons -  AIP Conference Proceedings Since end of the Cold War, nuclear alert rates have been reduced in several ways:
• Strategic bombers were taken off alert in 1991.
• ICBM warhead loading reduced (United States); New START treaty included ICBM MIRV ban but was
abandoned in favor of ballistic missile defenses against rogue states.
• SLBM warhead loading reduced (United States).
• De-targeting initiatives: ICBMs/SLBMs targeted at open ocean areas during peacetime (note: de-targeting is
not dealerting).
• Non-strategic forces taken off alert. Most warheads destroyed but remaining placed in central storage. Some
still deployed on bases near launchers (US bombs in Europe; French cruise missiles). Note that the AIP publication also uses the term to indicate weapon readiness, where they say that Russia and the US both have about 20% of their nukes ready to fire on short notice.  That's likely not what this is about, short term.  This is about personnel, not gear: Putin has ordered the defence minister and the chief of the military to put nuclear deterrent forces in a ‘special regime of combat duty’. Finally, in a some-dude-on-Twitter-said vein, I found this when I tried to compare US Defcon levels to what Russia is up to: Like US DEFCON levels, Russia has a number of readiness levels: Putin ordered nuclear forces to ELEVATED level today. Concerning but not cause for panic yet (Where 1. would be lowest, as opposed to the US's DEFCON 1 being the worst and DEFCON 5 being ""no worries""?) DW has picked these levels up as well, but is not sure where Putin's ""special level"" sits. ""The expression he used to indicate some heightened state of alert does not exist in Russian military manuals,"" Eggert, DW's Russia affairs analyst said. There are four levels of alert in the Russian military, he explained. Those four levels are: regular, heightened, the threat of war and full or complete. ""Nuclear forces are pretty much always on heightened alert,"" Eggert noted."
Can somebody explain Brexit in a few child-proof sentences?,"The EU is like a club that countries can join. The club has rules, one of which is called Article 50 and was written by a British guy. Article 50 says how countries can leave the club, and that it takes two years during which time they have to negotiate the terms they want to leave on. A lot of people in Britain like being in the club, and a lot of businesses have come to rely on the benefits of membership like being able to sell their stuff to other club member countries. So to keep them happy the Prime Minister wants to keep some of the benefits of membership. But other people don't like the club and just want out completely, and she wants to make them happy too. Because it's impossible to keep everyone happy and no-one really thought this through back when the vote happened, it's all become a bit of mess."
What caused the tendency for conservatives to not support climate change regulations? [duplicate],"Politics (of either mainstream party) in the USA is dependent on money from big business.  Many of those big businesses prioritise short term profit over long term environmental preservation, or have bonus systems that promote short term (<5 years) gains over long term (>100 years) gains.  Climate change action may reduce short term profits, in particular for businesses heavily invested in fossil fuels.  Companies working in the oil and gas industry
donate more to Republicans than to Democrats (see Western Refining and ExxonMobil in particular), and presently, the Republican Party is the primary home of conservatives in the USA.  On the other hand, there is also a lot of money to be made in climate change action, and many high tech companies donate a lot more to the Democrats than to the Republicans, so one can equally argue that Democrat politicians support climate change action not out of idealism but due to corporate donations (I'm not saying this argument is right or wrong, but it can be made). Climate change action may be (correctly or not) perceived to affect the short term lifestyle of consumers.  Propaganda by big business may stress those aspects of climate change action that have such an impact.  Some voters may dislike the idea of a impact on their short term lifestyle, and thus be happy to listen. Of course, for some people, such as employees in the fossil fuel industry (coal miners), the short term impact on their life may be major, in particular if they do not successfully transition into new industries (with or without government help). Many proposals for the mitigation of climate change require government action including taxation, and many conservatives are inherently skeptical of any government intervention in the economy in general and of taxation in particular.  A tax on CO₂ emissions is a government intervention and a taxation, and even many conservatives who support climate change action in principle may oppose such a taxation because they want to reduce taxation in general, preferring ""market based"" solutions such as CO₂ trading schemes (although the latter is still a government intervention; I don't know what such a market based solution would look like without any government-organised pricing of externalities in some way)¹. In the USA (and, perhaps to a lesser degree, in Europe), there still exist mainstream politicians who either deny the science of anthropogenic climate change altogether, or state that the impacts are exaggerated.  For the groups mentioned above (at least the first two bullet points), it may be convenient to deny that the problem exists, so that they don't need to answer why they won't support action to resolve the problem.  See Fizz' answer for evidence on the partisan divide in accepting scientific findings on climate change.  There may be a handful of people who state that God created the Earth and therefore humans cannot change the climate, but that view is probably not held by a large number of people (see also Rogers answer). Even among those who accept anthropogenic climate change, some may argue that action is useless because other/bigger countries aren't taking action, but I don't know if this view is more prevalent among conservatives than among progressives. ¹I suppose that a libertarian-legalistic answer would be that the inhabitants of Bangladesh in 200 years can simply sue all the world's industry emitting CO₂ between 1850 and 2050 for drowning them, or something like that.  You may be able to tell I don't really buy this approach to environmental pollution including climate change.  If one takes the ""don't cause harm to others"" principle to the extreme, that would imply radical environmentalism, as any air pollution or greenhouse gas emissions contributes to harming others at present and in the future."
Why won't President Obama apologize for the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki?,"It is hard to explain why conventional bombing of a city is principally better, morally, than a nuclear bombing of a city.  If Obama apologized for the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, he should also apologize for all the other bombings of Japanese and German cities during WWII. Nuclear bombings were not prohibited by the Hague conventions. By today's estimations, if the USA wouldn't use nuclear weapons, the invasion would cost at least between 500,000 and 750,000, and maybe as high as 1,000,000 deaths (not casualties) of American soldiers. The number of killed Japanese soldiers is estimated to be 7 times higher. No country could be reasonably expected to sacrifice between 500,000 and 1,000,000 of its soldiers in order to save 300,000 enemy civilians. These figures do not include Chinese civilians which would be killed by the Japanese. In 1939-1945, about 3.9 million Chinese civilians were killed by Japanese. More Chinese people were tortured, raped etc. Japan has not asked for an apology. Japanese people, generally, don't want the apology either.  The Japanese emperor Hirohito, who is highly respected in his country, said: ""It's very regrettable that nuclear bombs were dropped, and I feel sorry for the citizens of Hiroshima, but it couldn't be helped because that happened in wartime."" Further, in the May 2016 Japan Times poll, 64.9% of Japanese respondents thought Obama does not need to apologize but that he should commit to nuclear nonproliferation. This figure does not include those Japanese who thought Obama should neither apologize nor commit to nuclear nonproliferation. Totally, almost 75% of Japanese respondents thought Obama should not apologize. Apologies might change the public view of bombings, which would worsen, rather than improve, the American image, and harm the relationships between the USA and Japan. They would lead to demands that reparations be paid for the bombings, and for all other bombings during WWII."
Is anyone advocating the promotion of homosexuality in UK schools?,"It seems this issue came to media attention with Parkfield primary school in Birmingham in March 2019. However, similar disputes in Birmingham schools do precede this kerfuffle.   The school's leadership had started a 'No Outsiders' class.  The point of this class was to teach children to be tolerant of people from different races, genders, or sexualities.  This initiative failed completely when Muslim parents removed 600 children from classes for a day.  This comes after 400 predominantly Muslim parents signed a petition in January demanding the lessons be discontinued.   The school's regulator, Ofsted, then stated that Parkfield had an ""outstanding"" record of ""tolerance, acceptance and mutual respect"".  Direct quotation from the 14th March article in The Guardian:  Andrew Moffat, who was awarded an MBE for his work in equality
  education, said he was threatened and targeted via a leaflet campaign
  after the school piloted the No Outsiders programme. Its ethos is to
  promote LGBT equality and challenge homophobia in primary schools. Moffat, who has been shortlisted for a world’s best teacher award,
  resigned from another primary school in Birmingham, Chilwell Croft
  academy, after a similar dispute. He is also the author of Challenging
  Homophobia in Primary Schools, a teaching document. At one of the Parkfield protests, parents held signs that read “say no
  to promoting of homosexuality and LGBT ways of life to our children”,
  “stop exploiting children’s innocence” and “education not
  indoctrination”. The evidence suggests that Parkfield attempted classes which challenged prejudices against race, gender, and the LGBT community.  These classes were rejected by Muslim parents on the grounds that this was equivalent to teaching their children to be LGBT.  The government's schools regulator however sided with the school's leadership and concluded the school had a good record of trying to deal with prejudice.   Parkfield's Head, Hazel Pulley, has said the following on the issue:  It's really upsetting for our staff, some of them are becoming ill,
  some of them really don't want to come to school.  Some say they've
  been shaking.  Losing weight, not wanting to eat food at all.  And the
  reason why is because they're met, especially the teachers of young
  children, with parents accusing them of things that are just not
  happening.   For example, the parents of young children are saying ""But you're
  teaching them certain sexual activity, which we don't agree with.""
  Well we don't, we certainly don't do that. Or we're using clay models
  or something to show children something of a sexual nature, we most
  certainly do not do that. There's a real concern about the myths that
  are out there, that we might be using, in assembly, pictures of our
  partners or conversations with children and those things are really
  not happening.  ...I think it's very clear, from school that we would never ever
  discuss sexual activity with very young children. We don't know whether this is evidence of a deliberate smear campaign by parents, or just a case of mass hysteria due to ignorance or prejudice.  Given Ofsted approval, it seems unlikely that such allegations about explicit sexual content are true. The Parkfield Parent's Community Group published a statement on the 23rd February 2019.  Their main concerns were that these lessons began without parental consultation, and that they were in effect teaching children sex; a claim which appears incorrect.   The policy of the school is disproportionate, morally unacceptable and
  violates the democratic rights of parents to have children educated in
  consistency with their own beliefs and philosophical convictions. One 4-year-old Parkfield child came home and said that her teacher had
  said “We can be a boy or a girl” and “wear boy’s clothes or girl’s
  clothes”. Another one told her mother that she learnt “boys can marry
  boys and girls can marry girls.” These are statements of legal fact.  The parent's group statement affirms the right of individuals under the Equality Act to self-expression and protection from discrimination, however the distinction between education of the legal fact and ""promotion"" i.e. advocacy is blurred.   There are claims of specific incidents which are regarded as crossing a red line.  Specifically, the claim that someone can be a Muslim and gay, and that children were asked to write ""being gay is OK"".   The statement does have a specific definition of promotion:  Introduction to the book: “What we now need to be teaching is that
  homophobia once existed but we don’t have it in our school today, and
  that to be a person who is gay or lesbian or transgender or bi-sexual
  is normal, acceptable and OK. Children need to be learning that they
  may identify or may not identify as LGBT as they grow up, and that
  whoever they grow into as an adult is also perfectly normal and
  acceptable.” (No outsiders in our school – page 2) (italics added,
  this is a promotion of a homosexual lifestyle). In this case there seems to be ambiguity on the question of promotion, as the parent's group themselves affirm the rights of individuals under the Equality Act. So this definition seems to leave more questions than answers.   EDIT: To clarify a broader cultural and legal context on the topic of toleration, as it appears this is not understood.  In the United Kingdom it is illegal to discriminate against someone because of  age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex, and sexual orientation.   British society's toleration is rooted in the bloody turmoil of the reformation, in which Catholics and Protestants butchered each other because they sincerely believed the other side were evil agents of the anti-Christ, and failure to do so would put their immortal souls in peril.   In 1673 the Test Act was introduced, requiring that anyone in the civil service must take communion in the Church of England.  The first progressive legislation was the Toleration Act 1688, allowing Nonconformist Protestants the right to assemble and worship.  However, nonconformists had to wait until the Sacramental Test Act 1828 before they could legally take public office.  Discrimination against Catholics was repealed in 1829 with the Roman Catholic Relief Act.   Toleration was gradually extended to other groups.  In 1967 the Sexual Offences Act decriminalised consenting relationships between adult men, the Race Relations Act 1968 ended discrimination in employment and housing, and the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 forbade discrimination by sex or marital status. In 1988 the Local Government Act's Section 28 forbade local government from promoting homosexuality.  This was repealed by 2003's Local Government Act, and later sexual orientation became part of the Equality Act 2010.   Toleration however is not afforded to groups believing in the elimination of sections of society.  Groups espousing Nazi or Islamist ideology are banned and their members jailed, and similarly groups dedicated to political violence are forbidden (Northern Irish terrorism: IRA, UVF, etc).   Schools are within their rights to educate children on the cultural and legal reality of their country.  This is especially important given the unfortunate reality of widespread prejudice.  Official records show on average 100,000 racist hate crimes a year in England and Wales.  Hate crimes against gay and lesbian people have doubled during 2013-2018 to around 12,000 incidents, while hate crimes against transgender people have trebled.  "
Why is the US still heavily relying on cash bails?,
Why do many countries ban the sale of one's own blood?,"Many countries are seeking to move to a system of 100% voluntary (unpaid) blood donations, and many others already have; according to the World Health Organization's Global Status Report on Blood Safety and Availability 2016, fifty-seven countries reported collecting 100% (or more
than 99%) of their blood supply from voluntary non-remunerated donations. The WHO has long advocated for countries to develop blood donation services on this basis - in 1975, WHA28.72 stated: Noting the extensive and increasing activities of private firms in
trying to establish commercial blood collection and plasmapheresis
projects in developing countries; Expressing serious concern that such
activities may interfere with efforts to establish efficient national
blood transfusion services based on voluntary nonremunerated
donations; Being aware of the higher risk of transmitting diseases
when blood products have been obtained from paid rather than from
voluntary donors, and of the harmful consequences to the health of
donors of too frequent blood donations (one of the causes being
remuneration), [...] URGES Member States: There are a variety of arguments employed when advocating for a 100% voluntary blood donation service. Firstly, the issue of coercion. Many organisations, including the WHO, the IFRC, and the Council of Europe argue that the provision of a financial incentive as motivation for donation amounts to coercion of the donor, and is incompatible with individual autonomy. Seemingly small payments can be significant even in developed countries - for example, the German Red Cross has pointed out that ""the €25 usually on offer for blood was three times the daily allowance for those on the lowest level of unemployment support in Germany."" This leads us to a related argument - under a paid system, donations are more likely to come from those with a poorer background, something which the WHO has labelled 'exploitation': Paid donors are vulnerable to exploitation and commercialization of the
human body as they usually come from the poorer sectors of society and
become paid blood donors due to economic difficulties. Any form of
exploitation of blood donors, including payment for blood, coercion
and the collection of blood from institutionalized or marginalized
communities such as prisoners diminishes the true value of blood
donation. A blood donation is a “gift of life”  that cannot be valued
in monetary terms. The commercialization of blood donation is in
breach of the fundamental principle of altruism which voluntary blood
donation enshrines. However, barring payment for blood wouldn't improve the situation of those who may rely on these payments - this is clearly a problem at a deeper level than blood donation. The quote from the WHO above, however, does introduce a more moral-based argument - some believe that putting a price on blood constitutes an objectification of the human being. According to the European Blood Alliance: From a Kantian perspective, the offer and acceptance of payment for
blood could be considered as constituting an instrumentalisation of a
person, in that the paid donor becomes a mere means to the ends of
others. In this view, payment for blood donation would violate the
principle of human dignity. In putting a ‘price’ on a personal ‘good’
– blood – human dignity would be threatened through devaluation of the
person involved. At a more practical level, there are also safety concerns under remunerated donations. The payment incentivises donors to hide factors which would disqualify them from giving blood, for example infections transmitted by blood transfusion or drug abuse. Again, according to the European Blood Alliance: Monetary incentives, as fixed allowances, can encourage undesirable
donor behaviour through concealment of existing risk factors in the
pre-donation interview. This can pose a threat to the quality of
collected blood and ultimately to patient safety. In the South of the
USA, donors from Mexico, some of whom are illegal drug users, travel
across the US border to donate at centres offering even modest
payments, whereas they do not donate in Mexico itself, because payment
for donations there is forbidden. It is noteworthy that similar
practices are presently developing along the eastern borders of
Germany and Austria."
What is the point in yard signs in presidential elections?,"It firms up the base. If you are willing to put up a sign then you have ""picked a side"" and you are less likely to forget to vote. It helps canvassers. If you have a sign up, then canvassers know what to expect if they knock (This is a supporter, we only need to remind them to vote. This is an opposer, expect a hostile reception) It functions as a reminder to the rest of the base: ""we think this is important, if you don't vote you are letting us (your neighbours) down."" There is a social aspect to voting and voting decisions. It is expected. It is part of the ritual of elections. It might sway a few undecided voters, it probably can't hurt, and it's cheap. Finally, many people have their own echo chambers, and mostly hear opinions that match their own. This can remind people that there are supporters of ""the other candidate"" even in their own neighborhood, making it seem possible to change their vote. It might encourage people to look at election literature--watch a debate. It might be the start of a process that leads to a person changing their mind."
Why don't US presidents run in other elections after their term ends?,"There's several reasons Courtesy to a colleague - Generally speaking, former Presidents generally refrain from current political commentary. This tends to extend to politics in general, lest they step on their successor's toes in any way Bush, however, in his limited public appearances has stayed mute about his successor, maintaining a custom among former presidents that dates back decades. While not all presidents have adhered to the practice, it has created a mostly amicable brotherhood of former presidents.
""George W. Bush is a traditionalist,"" CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen said. ""I think he holds to an old-fashioned standard that the presidency is one of the world's greatest fraternities and its members don't criticize each other.""
After leaving the White House, Bush made it clear that he was finished with the public stage. Although he has been more public since his presidential library opened in April, Bush has maintained that he will not criticize Obama. Political machines don't last forever. Clinton, for instance, was unable to rebuild the Obama coalition. Local politics differ greatly from national politics. Bradley Wilson linked this article in a comment, which advocates Obama running for his local House seat, while trying to ""nationalize"" the 2018 midterms. While I think he could easily win the seat, it's important to note that he failed to successfully campaign for a Democratic House after 2008. It's not clear that he could succeed now, where he has not in the last 4 elections. You would have to sway a LOT of districts to make this happen. If a former President did win a local political office, would he be happy in a far lesser role? It's harder to go backwards from the top"
Why is Cuba still leasing Guantanamo Bay to the US?,"So why has the Cuban government not asked them to leave? The simple answer to that is that they have.   From Wikipedia:   The United States assumed territorial control over the southern portion of Guantánamo Bay under the 1903 Cuban–American Treaty of Relations. The United States exercises complete jurisdiction and control over this territory, while recognizing that Cuba retains ultimate sovereignty. The current government of Cuba regards the U.S. presence in Guantánamo Bay as illegal and insists the Cuban–American Treaty was obtained by threat of force and is in violation of international law. Some legal scholars judge that the lease may be voidable. And later  After the Cuban Revolution, Dwight D. Eisenhower insisted the status of the base remain unchanged, despite Fidel Castro's objections. Since then, the Cuban government has cashed only one of the rent checks from the U.S. government, and even then only because of ""confusion"" in the early days of the leftist revolution, according to Castro. The remaining un-cashed checks made out to ""Treasurer General of the Republic"" (a title that ceased to exist after the revolution) are kept in Castro's office stuffed into a desk drawer. They've asked (e.g. in 2016).  The United States (US) has not left.  The basis of not leaving (again from Wikipedia):   In 1934 a new Cuban-American Treaty of Relations reaffirming the lease granted Cuba and its trading partners free access through the bay, modified the lease payment from $2,000 in U.S. gold coins per year to the 1934 equivalent value of $4,085 in U.S. dollars, and made the lease permanent unless both governments agreed to break it or until the U.S. abandoned the base property. The US has never agreed to ending the treaty, and it requires both parties to agree to end it.   Reading the sources implies that ending the treaty is something that Fidel Castro requested repeatedly, but I can't find a primary source actually stating that.  "
What will happen if China stops loaning money to the U.S.?,"There are some assumptions being made by this question that don't reflect how the international economic order works. Countries do not ever have to pay off all of their debt A nation's finances are not like a person's. A person has a finite lifespan, and creditors take this into account when giving a loan. A country does not have a finite lifespan, and thus it has, in theory, forever to pay off its debt. Additionally, due to inflation, the value of a loan decreases over time. $1.2 Trillion will be worth less 50 years from now than it is today, which is another reason countries do not strive to pay off all their debt. If the money they are being credited drives growth such that the GDP growth minus the loan plus time is greater than GDP growth without the deficit-spending-aided growth, then the deficit was worth it. Think of it like this, if you have a loan with an interest rate of 3%, but you have stock market investments that continually return at 7%, it is more profitable to maintain some level of investment rather than pay down all your debt in a sprint. Riskier, yes, but more profitable. China is not the only creditor of the United States, large or otherwise Japan is nearly as a large a creditor to the United States as China, each owning about 1/6th of the US debt that is held by foreign countries. Ireland, Brazil, and the UK are also large holders of US debt. To answer your question directly  Yes. There are many other countries which can lend the US money, and as long as US debt is considered investment grade, countries will continue to buy it."
"Why is ""president for life"" in China such a big deal?","Putin is de facto leader for more than 3 mandates (not much big difference from ""for life"") and I do not remember to be illustrated so harshly Consider revisiting your news sources somewhat. There was an international outcry at the time (in the West anyway), because he had the constitution changed to stay in power. Plus, whataboutism is a logical fallacy. Why ""president for life"" in China is such a big deal? Because as undemocratic as the regime may have been in recent decades, it has had a somewhat inexplicable knack for having one or two term dictators rather than a series of dictators for life like North Korea. Some (many?) fear that this change might be a return to the Mao days. Which might be sort of fine to outsiders if you're a backward developing country, but not so inviting to outsiders when you're the second largest economy in the world and the main US trading partner."
Does the Electoral College system really favor low population areas?,"Yes it does, but there's a specific reason for it. It's important from a historical context to understand that the framers of the Constitution had 3 major concerns in mind when they created the Electoral College, all of them talked about one way or another in the Federalist Papers: To the point of your question, the system is set up so that smaller states get a small edge so they can still be competitive in an election against bigger ones. Can it be done better?  Well that's a whole other question."

Can I (a random person in the world) be prosecuted under the new Hong Kong security law?,"How far applicable the law of a country is is decided by the law of that country. If other countries disagree, they can obviously decline to assist in the enforcement of those laws, and disallow the agents of the first country to act on their territory. There even is precedent that a country outlaws behaviour not related to it at all.

France and the UK both make torture punishable, again regardless of who and where. There are more examples: Universal Jurisdiction on Wikipedia"
What have the US and NATO done in Afghanistan for 20+ years?,"It would be grossly unfair to think that the NATO and US military did not try their very best to win this.  Many soldiers paid a very high price and are now justifiably very distressed.  Pretty certain however is that the US and NATO governments were careless and overconfident when they engaged in yet another hard-to-win guerilla war. For 20 years, the US + NATO were involved in a counterinsurgency war.  Those are very hard to win for a foreign power, Malaysia(UK)* was about the only one I can think of after WW2 involving a Western democracy **. Peru vs Shining Path.  75K deaths, about 25K of those civilians killed by the government. Spain vs. ETA.  UK vs. IRA.  More police actions vs. narrow terrorist bases than full-on wars. Indonesia vs. Communists.  Extremely bloody, 500K-1.2M deaths.  (quite possibly not a real insurgency but rather a pretext to suppress political opponents by Suharto - txs @timeskull) Picture yourself as a ""good guy"" foreign soldier fighting against ""bad guys"" insurgents.  Your goals are to: protect and bring over to your side the civilians you don't speak the local language or know the customs development projects, if successful, can help you winning over local leaders helps too having a competent and credible government that the population likes is the gold standard.  Don't mess this up (but it's your home politicians' responsibility and you can assume they'll drop the ball). one strategy calls for establishing safe areas for the population by having dispersed troops in outpost providing local security and then spread out your influence.  This however puts you in a static defensive posture and leaves many more-or-less isolated units at risk. kill bad guys.  However, since insurgents are essentially badly armed civilians fighting you, every time you kill one, you may anger his cousin/brother/buddy into becoming an insurgent. Now, say you are an insurgent, fighting against the foreigners.  Your goals are: kill anyone collaborating with the foreigners and neutralize development projects.  Kill any competent local officials.  This is why talking about nation-building is easy, but hard to pull off. provoke foreigners into killing civilians, preferably with media exposure keep the population either on your side or too scared to oppose you. kill foreign soldiers.  Not necessarily a huge goal, except it can provoke them to overreact and it's great for morale and propaganda. The question then becomes whose willpower outlasts the others.  If the regular soldiers are not in a do-or-die situation, i.e. if they are foreigners who can return home when their public tires of the war, there is a good chance the insurgents will win. If the government/outside power can gradually isolate the population from the insurgents' cause, the manpower replacements for the insurgents will wither.  Extreme insurgent violence towards civilians can discredit them.  Successful governments that win over the people can carry that off as well. Finally, a minority insurgency that is operating against a government in its own country (ETA, IRA) really leaves the government no choice but to continue the fight or solve via negotiations, as the government can't pull out.  The communication problem largely goes away and dead soldiers may turn public opinion against you.  Part of the reason why Peru and Indonesia ended up with government wins.  This is also the reason Hamas' terrorism is bound to fail:  their stance that Israel should not exist backs Israel into a corner. For the rest, well, standard armies are still trying to figure out a foolproof way to win these wars.  Counter-intuitively, you typically need more soldiers than there are badly-armed insurgents to win. For details on how the US and NATO failed, you might as well read Pete W's linked War Nerd article, it looks pretty solid: You also need to consider if you want to ""tune"" your regular army to be efficient at counter-insurgency:  being nice, helping out with development projects, having weaponry useful to that context rather than good at killing peer-enemy field armies.  That's why a police force approach is best, if you can pull it off.  Also, constant low-level casualties and deployments are a drain on recruitment and retention of career soldiers. * Malaysia is ""pretty special"".  The Communist insurgents were ethnic Chinese who were distinct from the larger Malay population.  And the UK had pretty much promised to decolonize anyway.  And see Fizz's comment. **.  Why the post-WW2 cutoff date?  Simply put, because Western electorates, over time since decolonization, have become vastly less tolerant of their militaries killing large numbers of people without a critical reason.  It is hard to picture modern French people for example accepting the need to kill 300K-1M Algerians to stay in Algeria.  Or Americans acquiescing in Rolling Thunder and Linebacker II.  See also Fizz and Graham's comments below. *** Under Rumsfeld?  As Secretary of Defense, Rumsfeld had a huge, outsized, influence on Afghanistan/Iraq.  In Iraq at least, he managed to sideline the State Department after the initial successful invasion to decide how the US should interact with Iraq."
What is the Alt-Left?,"The alt-left is not really a thing unless you live in Switzerland, where it is a political party. In the US, it's a term that got cooked up by the alt-right to describe their fantasized progressive equivalent. The problem, of course, is that there is no such thing. There's the oddball violent antifa, but where the aim of such would-be alt-left might be fighting intolerance or a better (re)distribution of wealth, that of the alt-right is white supremacy. Personally, I find it hard to accept that the two are equivalent. The alt-left is leaning far left, whereas the alt-right stands for everything the US fought against during the Civil War and World War II. The expression's history has a few interesting tidbits. Long story short, it seems to have appeared in Reddit alt-right groups. There is about zero reference to it in Google (except for the keyboard shortcut) prior to the last US presidential campaign. It got some uptake after a Vanity Fair article denouncing it as a problem. (There also were a few calls to embrace the term after the article.) It got much more serious uptake after Trump used the term in his ""on both sides"" commentary after Charlottesville."
Why are American elections and politics receiving so much coverage in Canadian and European media?,"The U.S. has a great deal of influence in the world, so the presidency of the U.S. is quite likely to affect your own country in some way. For example: In the last 20 years the U.S. invaded Afghanistan & Iraq, wrecked Libya and tried (and is still trying?) to topple Assad in Syria, which at least in part facilitated the refugee crisis that had a great effect on Europe. Furthermore the relationship between the U.S. and Europe is currently as bad as it has ever been at least during my lifetime with Trump raising tariffs, pulling troops out and making explicit economic threats over the Nordstream 2 gas pipeline and in general. When you compare that with the rather cordial relationship we had with Obama, it obviously really matters who sits in the White House. German politics, and this probably holds true for many other countries as well, is quite boring compared to what is taking place in the U.S. American politics is basically a kind of reality-T.V. with great drama, mudslinging, twists & turns and generally enormous amounts of money being spent on it (federal election campaigning in Germany doesn't even cross the 100 million dollar mark in comparison..). American politics is incredibly fake but also very entertaining. Just compare a German election debate to an American one. Or Angela Merkel to whatever presidential candidate for that matter. Excitement looks different... not that I would prefer that kind of excitement in my country, but as said, it is quite entertaining."
Would the USA be eligible to join the European Union?,"The first requirement for joining the EU is wanting to join. A far shot for the USA, but we assume this hypothesis in the question. European Union has defined its Conditions for Membership in 1993. They are often referred to as the Copenhagen criteria. Countries wishing to join need to have: stable institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities; a functioning market economy and the capacity to cope with competition and market forces in the EU; the ability to take on and implement effectively the obligations of membership, including adherence to the aims of political, economic and monetary union. The EU also needs to be able to integrate new members. I would think that the political criteria could be met quite easily. Rule of law and human rights are well established in the USA. There would be some discussion, and possibly adaptation needed, about the situation of Native Americans, about the political rights for American citizens living in Puerto Rico, Guam and other territories that are arguably excluded from Presidential and Congress elections, about the death penalty or about racial policies (Europe doesn't recognize races and might debate if it can admit a country where Affirmative Action is a thing). But overall, I don't think these are obstacles that good faith on both sides wouldn't overcome. The economical criteria is another story: given the US important public debt, it would need to engage into serious efforts to reduce its public deficit and improve its trade balance to meet European criteria (even if they are less strict for becoming a member than for joining the Eurozone). Subsidies for homeland agriculture and industries would have to be abandoned. It would require difficult, long-term and unpopular economic reforms. About the geographic criteria: Article 49 (formerly Article O) of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) or Maastricht Treaty states that any European country that respects the principles of the EU may apply to join. Countries' classification as European is ""subject to political assessment"" by the Commission and more importantly—the European Council.  Basically, it is up to EU to decide what country is ""European"" or not. The answer has been ""no"" for Morocco, ""yes"" for Cyprus and Malta, and is still subject of heated debates for Turkey. Because there is no precise definition of the borders of Europe, I would think that ultimately it would be a political decision and if Europeans were motivated to include the USA, they would make a case to allow them to join (based on history or values or whatnot). Same as they would allow Iceland to join without much geographical nitnitting. Anyway, territories likes the Azores or French Guyana are already part of the Union (considered as European Outermost Regions) while Greenland, Bermuda, Falkland Islands or New Caledonia are Overseas Countries and Territories of the Union.

Why is Trump's omission of an explicit mention of Jews from the holocaust memorial a big deal?,"Antisemitism was central to the Holocaust, the reason for which was the desire to exterminate all Jews.  To not acknowledge that fact when remembering the Holocaust is at least careless and it sends out a certain message, even if that message was not intended. It generalizes the Holocaust to a generic evil, and strips all context from it.    The message was also promptly picked up by the far-right. Richard Spencer for example welcomed the ""de-Judaification"" of the Holocaust, and the Daily Stormer called it ""pushing back against Jewish supremacy"". Vox puts this in a larger context: Trump’s most fervent supporters included outspoken anti-Semites, online trolls on the “alt-right” who delighted at tormenting Jewish journalists and public figures. His campaign flirted with anti-Semitic tropes, including tweeting an image of a star of David with Hillary Clinton’s face superimposed on a pile of money. His closing ad warned of a shadowy cabal of bankers and international elites. His son casually used the phrase “warming up the gas chambers” to refer to vociferous criticism.    In each case, Trump and his inner circle refused to back down or apologize, and his anti-Semitic fans interpreted those controversies as coded signals in their favor. Now that he’s president, the same dynamic is playing out around his statement on the Holocaust."
How is printing money different from taxing people?,"I can see one difference between taxing the people and printing currency. Taxing the people only takes money away from the people in that country, as the people outside the country don't have to pay taxes (except in special cases such as the US and possibly a few other countries, as mentioned in the comments). However, printing currency would take money away from everybody who has that form of currency, including those outside the country."
Why do right-wing parties generally oppose the legalization of marijuana?,"Much of politics doesn't fit into the traditional left-right one-dimensional political spectrum. Politics is multi-dimensional. Marijuana legalisation (and the legalisation/regulation of other drugs) is a socially liberal as well as economically liberal idea. While being economically liberal, many people on the Right wing are not socially liberal. Rightly or wrongly they concern themselves with what people do to themselves and with each other. They are socially conservative, socially illiberal, authoritarian or religious. They might see it as their duty to prevent people from doing harm to themselves, their families and society through the use of currently illicit drugs. It is moral, in their view, to prevent the use of such drugs, regardless of the purported economic benefits of liberalisation. The UK's Conservative Party membership comprises a variety of political outlooks that include social liberalism and social conservatism."
"Why are Deep South states said to vote so lop-sidedly Republican, when they have high percentages of African Americans?","Using the Cooperative Congressional Election Study 2018, we can test your hypothesis that non-African Americans skew as far to the Republicans as African Americans do to Democrats. Let's limit ourselves firstly to voters in the deep south, which I'll define as Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, & South Carolina. This gives us a survey population of 4,920. We can then stratify the survey population by race, and look at how they identify politically. Looking at the 1,155 of these respondents who self-identified as 'Black', we can construct the following breakdown - clearly black respondents skew heavily towards the Democratic Party.  Looking now at the remaining respondents, we can obtain a very different graph - we see a large number of 'Strong Republican' respondents, as well as a general skew towards the Republican end of the scale. However, there isn't quite such a well-defined skew as the first graph.  Despite the skew not being quite so dramatic, it is dramatic enough to ensure that the states as a whole generally vote Republican. Firstly, the 40% figure in your question isn't quite accurate - according to the American Community Survey 2018 figures, Black or African American Alone makes up between 26.6% (South Carolina), and 38.0% (Mississippi) of the population, for a total proportion of around 30.6% of the population of the above five states. This factor, exacerbated by a small turnout gap, allows the vast Democratic lean amongst the Black population to be outweighed by the relatively smaller, but still large, Republican lean within the non-Black population.  However, on a more local level, the African American demographic does have a significant effect. As the population tends to be centred around the 'Black Belt', this allows the Democratic lean of the demographic to be more obviously represented. For example, the county-level map of the 2016 election provides an interesting depiction of this phenomenon. "
What is the meaning of $1.05 as seen at March For Our Lives?,"As Vox explains it is directed at Senator Rubio, who has opposed the March and their movement, representing the value they believe he has placed on their lives by dividing the number of dollars he has received from the NRA by the number of school children purportedly harmed by his pro-gun stance: [T]hey came up with it by dividing the amount the National Rifle
  Association has spent to support Rubio’s campaigns, $3.3 million, by
  the 3.1 million public and private students in the state. Since
  Rubio’s first senate bid in 2010, the NRA has spent about $1 million
  to support his campaigns, and $2.3 million to attack his opponents,
  according to the Center for Responsive Politics."
Do/did non-dictatorial Communist societies exist?,"Both of your bullet points are correct, and both are wrong. Yes, communism was actually successfully applied. The caveats are that it was only successful under the following limitations: in an extremely small scale (either geographically - think a single village - e.g. Kibbutzes in Israel are, for all intents and purposes, an example of Communism in action; or professionally - think FOSS and/or FSF as contained systems). Some less ""standard"" examples would be theology-based communes, from early Christians to late new-age hippies. in an society which is a part of a larger society - by which I mean that said communist small scale implementation has access to larger demographics (allowing them to draw in fresh members who aren't yet disenchanted with the idea/practice AND to outplace those in the community who are disenchanted; as well as shed excess children so you don't have to grow significantly if your birth/survival rate exceeds 2.1). In an open economic system. For example, Kibbutzes or hippie communies in California don't need to spend money on R&D in agriculture, or defense, or large scale law enforcement (again, you may have the luxury to exclude 1-3% of psychopaths/sociopaths from a small community, and not worry about said excluded psychopaths attacking you for your communal material possessions from outside since they are dealt with by outside society), or on disaster preparedness, or on medical R&D, or pretty much any other economic overhead of modern civilization. Possessed economy and quality of life above subsistence-level farming, and did not depend on unusually rich natural resources. For example, presumably, you could have a communist community in an area with unlimited energy-rich wild life and vegetation, warm, stable climate and natural places to live such as caves. Basically, where you don't actually need industry or production to live reasonably well). It's an open question (there is not enough data) as to how ""communist"" actual pre-historical societies were - they clearly had less inequality based on material culture remains, but that's not proof. No, there was never a successful attempt to implement communism on large scale (a country with 10+ million population, modern infrastructure, and not dependent in large part on external aid in variety of forms). Every time it was attempted, it failed to get to the communist stage, because communism as an idea is very attractive in theory yet in practice incompatible with actual human nature. The main problems of communism without an accompanying authoritarian political regime include: Lack of incentives. For all the noise about intrinsic motivation being better than extrinsic - that may be true for select white collar workers, but how many people would be intrinsically motivated to do hard farm work in agriculture, or to spend 100-hour weeks making their IT startup successful, or  to be a plumber fixing other people's toilets? Even SO rewards people with reputation points, with original (never materialized) implied promise that higher SO rep would translate to being more hirable as a programmer. Human greed and jealousy. We evolved this way, so no amount of education will drive it out. Even monkeys do this. The fact that a fraction of society are always sociopaths/psychopaths; and many of them are smart enough to be able to channel their character ""legally"", within the system (or around it without being caught). Lack of competitiveness related to other states around you. The only way you can not lag long term and be a communist regime is to not have a competing free system with higher productivity driven by better incentive structures. The only way you can avoid a lot of your own high producers draining to a more competitive system is by threat of force. Welcome to dictatorship (anytime you prevent your citizens who wish to leave for greener pastures from doing so by threat of force, you are a closer to authorian than free state)."
Why is it impossible to leave the Single Market without a hard Irish border?,"In the strictest sense, it is of course possible; but it doesn’t make any sense, unless Brexit is only for symbolism. The whole point of Brexit (beside the symbolism) and of leaving the single market and the customs union is to allow Britain to act independently from its former partners – at least in trade issues. On the other hand, one main point of a single market is to allow goods to be traded as seemlessly between, say, Madrid and London as they traditionally are traded between Manchester and London; there should be no trade barriers in a single market. So let’s consider some scenarios where Brexit Britain starts doing its own thing while the Irish border remains fully open: The British parliament and government decide, in order to protect the British strawberry growers from unfair (sunnier) competition, to introduce a 200% import duty on strawberries. (This is a tariff barrier.) The meaning is that strawberries bought for £ 2 a kilogram in Spain should cost at least £ 6 when reaching England. However, importers take their Spanish strawberries to Dublin (no import duty because single market), then across the Irish border to Belfast (no import duty because fully open border), then to England (no import duty because of the UK’s own internal single market), and sell for £ 3. The British strawberry growers and the government aren’t happy. The British authorities decide to allow treating chickens with chlorine. This is not allowed in the EU, and chlorinated chickens aren’t supposed to be in circulation within the EU. (This new regulatory divergence between Brexit Britain and the EU amounts to a non-tariff barrier.) However, Northern Irish farmers take their chlorinated chickens to the Republic (possible because fully open border) and sell them to supermarkets there, and in other EU members. The EU and its remaining member states aren’t happy. The president of the US, Donald Trump, likes Brexit Britain so much that he generously exempts it from his 25% import duty on steel. Belgian steel works transport their produce via Ireland and Northern Ireland to the US, avoiding the duty that is supposed to target them. President Trump isn’t happy. Of course, Brexit Britain could refrain from utilizing its newly-found power to diverge, voluntarily keeping the rules that the EU has. That, however, would mean “a Brexit in name only”, i.e. pure symbolism."
What does Texas gain from keeping its electrical grid independent?,"Citing Economist.com coverage The state’s deregulated power market is also fiercely competitive. ERCOT oversees the grid, while power generators produce electricity for the wholesale market. Some 300 retail electricity providers buy that fuel and then compete for consumers. For years the benefits of Texas’s deregulated market structure were clear. At 8.6 cents per kilowatt hour, the state’s average retail price for electricity is around one-fifth lower than the national average and about half the cost of California’s. On the flip side of things Because such cold weather is rare, energy companies do not invest in “winterising” their equipment, as this would raise their prices for consumers. Perhaps most important, the state does not have a “capacity market” to ensure that there was extra power available for surging demand. Such systems elsewhere act as a sort of insurance policy so the lights will not go out, but it also means customers pay higher bills. On the practical side, it would thus seem that, due to competition there are a lot of, small, providers who compete on price.  Thus there are real advantages. Citing ERCOT itself Cmmission Chairman Donna Nelson says
the federal Power Act was a key moment
Congress passed the law in 1935 to
regulate the interstate activities of
electric power the utilities in Texas
were smart and they got together and
they made an agreement that nobody was
going to send power outside of Texas the Public Utility Commission and that
independence has been jealously guarded
I think both by policymakers and by the
industry in our cot the next major
change came in 1965 after the worst
power outage in US history the blackout
did not impact Texas Add up what seems to be an end in itself, ""avoiding those horrible Federal busybodies"" and lower costs and you have the positive sides. From ARS This deep-seated aversion to regulation recently prompted former US Energy secretary and Texas Governor Rick Perry to quip, ""Texans would be without electricity for longer than three days to keep the federal government out of their business.” Unlike the lofty claims made in another answer, keep in mind that California, on the other end of the regulation scale, ends up with higher prices, unreliable electricity and a near-monopoly provider whose rather relaxed maintenance procedures directly triggered wildfires that killed 85 people at one sitting.  In fact, if you think of a government monopoly as the ultimate form of regulation, it is rather infrequent that consumers benefit from low costs under those circumstances (leaving out oddities like governments bribing their voters via subsidies like Venezuelan gas prices). On the negative side, while overregulation and government overreach can be a problem, reasonable regulations do exist for a reason.  An airbag in a car is a total waste of money, until it blows up and saves a life.  Forcing utilities to make their systems more redundant and cope with extreme ranges in their operating circumstances, if done well, can make them more resilient. With so many providers competing on price in a highly deregulated environment, one can assume the Texas utilities did as little as possible to design in safety margins and in fact the ongoing debrief of where things broke down shows things broke down pretty much everywhere, from wind turbines to gas to nuclear. The picture of what went wrong in Texas is incomplete. But while some wind generators did go offline as turbines iced over, the state's largest grid, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, said the shortage was driven by a failure not of renewable sources but of traditional ""thermal"" sources: coal, nuclear and especially natural gas. Energy experts said that gas lines supplying gas-fired plants may have frozen or that supplies to the plants may have been limited as gas was prioritized for homes that rely on gas for their heat. Citing ARS again Power plants obviously operate much farther north than Texas, in areas where the conditions Texas is facing now are normal for weeks or months at a time. There are ways to cold-proof various systems; wind turbines, for example, can have heaters embedded in the blades to shed ice when needed, intake pipes can be heated by exhaust from power plants, etc. But all of these measures cost additional money, which may be difficult to justify if the conditions they're needed for are extremely rare. It turns out that these conditions are rare in Texas, but not extremely so; Texas faced something similar a decade earlier, in 2011, when its grid suffered similar failures. Reuters, has another, largely uncomplimentary writeup that gives a bit more detail about that absent capacity market and ERCOT's mishandling of this event. Last, but not least, in the context of switching to wind and solar renewables, on which Texas is unexpectedly active, you want to interconnect as much as possible to avoid regional intermittency. Texas electricity is sowewhat cheaper than the national average.  How much of that is due to avoiding Federal regulation is unclear, as Texas in any case enjoys advantages of scale, resources and geography.  But it is also clear lacking interconnects and  an overly light touch on actual resiliency engineering - as opposed to NIMBY-type regulations as in California - has developed not necessarily to Texas's advantage."
"Why is abortion such a central issue in US politics, but not in the UK?","The following is necessarily a massive oversimplification. America is, by and large, the most religious of the high-GDP countries that aren't Middle Eastern (and heavily Muslim) oil exporting nations. Compared to most Western European nations especially, the US has a significantly higher number of people who consider themselves highly religious, and a notably smaller proportion of those who identify as non-religious.  In the UK, some 55% of people say they are not religious, with about 34% identifying as Christian.  By contrast, in the US some 63% of people identify as Christian, most of them Protestants, and only 28% identify as non-religious.  That's about a 30% swing.  Imagine how much different the UK would be if a quarter of its population swapped over to being heavily religious from non-religious. As such, religious moralism, especially Protestant Christian moralism, plays a major role in all aspects of American society and politics at large. And Protestant (and Evangelical) Christianity largely sees abortion as one of the gravest sins imaginable (or at least, it seems the gravest one they're willing to get riled up about at the moment).  There's simply no comparable religious undercurrent in the UK.  While there are surely religious people there who take issue with abortion, they do not pose nearly as large of a sector of the voting (and politically vocal) populace. Add to this the contrast in ""reversibility"" on the legality of abortion.  In the UK, all Parliament has to do is pass a new law, requiring simply a majority of MPs, and boom, you can completely alter if something is allowed or not. You can even override court decisions this way, as Parliament is ultimately the supreme authority. Contrast in America, where a right to abortion has thus far been held as constitutionally protected by our Supreme Court.  And the only thing that can override the Supreme Court on this is itself or a constitutional amendment. An amendment normally requires congressional two-thirds majorities in both chambers (only one of which is proportionate to population, but gerrymandered) and three quarters of states (which is definitely not proportionate to national population).  This is obscenely difficult, and in theory a rather small fraction of our population can prevent any amendment, even if everyone else is vigorously in favor.  Thus the much simpler solution: alter the Supreme Court to your view point. Which is still hard due to lifetime appointments, but easier than an amendment you don't have massive majorities for these days.  And if you succeed, that difficulty now protects your success. The only way to go about that is through national politics, as Justices are appointed and confirmed through the federal political branches. All told this created a massive political pressure.  Abortion, once a state issue with little national character, was catapulted into a primary issue of national importance because a significant fraction of the population abhorred the constitutional protection of abortion, and so had to mobilize in the single plausible direction of correction: a massive alteration of national politics aimed to alter the Supreme Court's jurisprudence.  This sort of urgent need to exploit national politics doesn't seem to arise in UK's system because simple majorities in the Commons are all you ever need, and the appointment of judges to their Supreme Court or other courts are significantly less political—at least at present to my understanding, as Prime Ministers are largely required to appoint Justices from candidates selected by an independent commission—, and have a mandatory retirement age.  The strategy of obstructing and playing the waiting game to win over a single government institution to achieve long term changes in the law is much less likely to succeed in the UK than in the US, especially when there are ostensibly much easier avenues to achieve your goals anyway, and they can be much more easily reversed."
"In most U.S. states, female genital mutilation is illegal. So why is male circumcision legal?","Clitoridectomies are not equivalent to male circumcision. Clitoridectomies are equivalent to removal of the glans (the head of the penis, which contains most of the nerve endings that produce sexual pleasure). It is possible to do an equivalent of circumcision on a female: i.e., removing the clitoral hood which normally covers the clitoris, leaving the clitoris exposed. This is sometimes done as an elective (cosmetic) surgery, and is a cultural practice followed by the Dawoodi Bohra sect of Islam, and among certain cultural groups in Indonesia and Malaysia (around 60-70 million cases across SE Asia). But that is not a distinction made under US law, and for the remainder of this answer, I will refer to this practice as 'female circumcision,' and will use the term 'clitoridectomy' to refer to the more drastic procedures. In every US state, the full or partial excision of the penis of a male child or young adult would be punishable at the very least as assault causing great bodily harm and felony child abuse. No laws have been specifically passed against this practice, because it is not an established practice of any known group; any case in which this occurred would be treated as an idiosyncratic crime under established law. Laws have been passed against clitoridectomies because that is an established practice of certain tribal groups, and opposing a cultural tradition of that sort calls for specific legal definition and action beyond the normal sanctions for individual crimes. Male circumcision, whatever its pros and cons, does not significantly interfere with reproduction or sexual pleasure (well... there are arguments that it has some negative impacts on the latter, but they are too complex and nuanced to get into here). Arguments in favor of male circumcision generally rest on issues of cleanliness, disease prevention, or cultural heritage, and most men adapt to the procedure perfectly well. There is evidence to suggest that female circumcision (which only removes the clitoral hood) is equally innocuous. But the US discourse focuses on those cases where the clitoris or parts of the labia are removed, caustic materials are used destroy genital sensitivity, or other permanent damage is inflicted on the female genitalia. These are perceived (under the title female genital mutilation) as acts of oppression against women, since the common perception is that the cultures that perform such acts intend to suppress female sexuality by reducing sexual pleasure. Those activities and beliefs are antithetical to the ideals and values of the US, and it is impossible to monitor individual procedures to ensure they conform to the mildest type, so the entire range of practices has been outlawed. N.B. In reference to a dispute in comments about the nature of the surgical equivalence... The clitoris, like the penis, has both a shaft and a glans, and in both cases the glans contains the vast majority of nerve endings that produce sexual pleasure. However, the male organ combines the channel for the transfer of semen (as well as for urination), while the female organ is separate from both those functions. The removal of the clitoris has no direct effect on the capacity to reproduce; the removal of the penis — though it does not make a man sterile — makes reproduction impossible without artificial insemination. Clitoridectomies remove the clitoris and the external portions of the clitoral shaft, so for the purposes of this answer we treat a clitoridectomy as equivalent to the removal of the male glans. For both men and women, removal of the glans still allows them to feel some sexual pleasure — the shaft itself is sensitive, and for women, part of the shaft is internal, and may survive excision — but such pleasure is greatly diminished."
Is there evidence that the Republican Party leadership wants fewer people to vote?,"""They had things—levels of voting that, if you ever agreed to it, you'd never have a Republican elected in this country again.""

What is Canada's case for applying tariffs on US dairy?,"It seems that Canada and the US use two different systems to protect their respective domestic dairy producers. In Canada ""Under a system called supply management, the Canadian government controls how much milk dairy farmers produce and how much it sells for"" thereby guaranteeing sustained dairy milk farming. In the US, milk dairy farmers are supported by government subsidies. In 2015  the American government doled out approximately $22.2 billion dollars in direct and indirect subsidies to the U.S dairy sector.  So the Canadian system tends to keep milk cost high, while the US system tends to keep milk cost low.  Everything is OK domestically, the problem is created when a milk processor in Canada wants to import less expensive milk from the US and in the process adversely impact the Canadian dairy milk farmer. “U.S. politicians have been quick to demonize Canada for its different system. Fair trade is in the eye of the beholder. For example, some 41 countries, including the U.S., has WTO approved tariff-rate quotas. The U.S. challenged Canada’s rights to use their quotas within NAFTA over 20 years ago. The U.S. lost (that challenge) discussion of dairy milk US subsidies Canadian protection of their dairy milk farmers"
What form of government does StackExchange resemble?,"I would say it resembles a meritocracy of a consultative nature. The more reputation you have (the more merit), the more influence.  A new user with 1 rep can neither vote nor comment. All they can do is ask and answer questions, so they have no decision influence whatsoever. As reputation increases (ultimately as decided by the community), users get more and more power. This only breaks down when it comes to ♦ moderators, which are elected — but again, only by users that have proven their merit by earning at least 150 reputation. Edit: as pointed out in comments and other answers, finally the community power is only of a consultative nature. The owners can choose to follow recommendations or not. They usually do, but ultimately, true power is with the SE company. Nevertheless, as long as the company listens to the community, people in the community still have influence, which is quite similar to power."
What are the implications of the EARN IT Act?,"The heart of the issue here is Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act was not part of the original Senate legislation, but was added in conference with the House, where it had been separately introduced by Representatives Christopher Cox (R-CA) and Ron Wyden (D-OR) as the Internet Freedom and Family Empowerment Act and passed by a near-unanimous vote on the floor. It added protection for online service providers and users from actions against them based on the content of third parties, stating in part that ""No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider."" Effectively, this section immunizes both ISPs and Internet users from liability for torts committed by others using their website or online forum, even if the provider fails to take action after receiving actual notice of the harmful or offensive content. The TL;DR here is that Stack Exchange (i.e. this website) cannot be sued for content you or I put on its platform. Stack Exchange is under no obligation to remove the content either, unless we violate someone's copyright. Child pornography is a serious problem (one of the few truly bipartisan positions left). Current Attorney General Bill Barr believes Section 230 is helping to protect bad actors “We are concerned that internet services, under the guise of Section 230, can not only block access to law enforcement — even when officials have secured a court-authorized warrant — but also prevent victims from civil recovery,” Barr argued. “ . . . Giving broad immunity to platforms that purposefully blind themselves – and law enforcers – to illegal conduct on their services does not create incentives to make the online world safer for children.  In fact, it may do just the opposite.” One central issue here has been the (now defunct) website Backpage. Backpage was a website that was well known to have had ads for sex acts, including sex trafficking of both women and children A January 2017 Senate report accused Backpage of facilitating online sex trafficking by stripping words like “lolita,” “little girl,” and “amber alert” from ads in order to hide illegal activity before publishing the ad, as well as coaching customers on how to post “clean” ads for illegal transactions. Judges in California and Massachusetts previously cited Section 230 in dismissing cases against Backpage. The law has already been altered to strip protections from Backpage by SESTA, which specifically targets sites that allowed ads like that. In that same vein, end-to-end encryption communication apps also facilitate such acts, and Barr has called for a ""back door"" to be inserted into encryption The U.S. Justice Department doesn’t want Facebook to encrypt messages on WhatsApp and its other messaging services, without giving law enforcement “backdoor” access to such conversations. The goal is to stop child pornographers, terrorists and foreign adversaries looking to disrupt U.S. institutions. The problem with EARNIT is that it would create a commission to propose policy going forward. If you didn't comply, you would no longer be protected by Section 230. Since no specific policy is being proposed by the law, it's impossible to predict what this commission will suggest. More importantly, the EFF notes If the Attorney General disagrees with the Commission’s recommendations, he can override them and write his own instead. This bill simply gives too much power to the Department of Justice, which, as a law enforcement agency, is a particularly bad choice to dictate Internet policy. EFF fears that Bill Barr may use it to enact encryption ""back doors"" which have a lot of problems conceptually The demand for a ""golden key"" for government access to encrypted data, then, isn't so much about necessity as it is expense and convenience. The problem is that no matter how clever such a skeleton key system might be, it is exceptionally fragile and bound to be misused, exploited by an adversary, or both. Reform Government Surveillance—a coalition formed by Google, Apple, Microsoft, Dropbox, and other cloud platform operators—issued a statement last May warning about the consequences of such efforts: ""Recent reports have described new proposals to engineer vulnerabilities into devices and services, but they appear to suffer from the same technical and design concerns that security researchers have identified for years,"" the alliance wrote. ""Weakening the security and privacy that encryption helps provide is not the answer."" It's also worth noting that while SESTA might have shut down Backpage, it really didn't have an impact on the root problem of sex trafficking [Police] generally acknowledge that commercial sex—yes, sometimes involving minors and/or victims of abuse—will go on with or without digital tools to facilitate it. Shutting down Backpage didn't even make a dent in the volume of online adult ads, according to a Washington Post analysis. It simply dispersed them through a wider range of platforms. Yet politicians insist on casting classifieds websites as the biggest cause and a main hub of forced and underage prostitution. Sen. Kamala Harris (D–Calif.) has described Backpage as the world's ""top online brothel."" It's fair to say that the commission might use its power for political aims rather than trying to protect children or stop sex trafficking."
Are there polls why Germans dislike Trump so much and consider him so dangerous?,"It's hard to provide an objective answer since this is a question mostly about emotions and everyone has his anecdotes. Since pretty much all answers here do not have any citations or references, it's likely that they are all colored by subjective perception. I'll try to provide some objective data, though it will undoubtedly still be colored by my personal opinion: According to one poll from cicero questioning 2088 people: Bei den Wählern der AfD sind die Zustimmungswerte für Trump mit 52,9 Prozent mit deutlichem Abstand am höchsten, am niedrigsten sind sie bei den Wählern von Bündnis90/Die Grünen (2,9 Prozent). 81 Prozent der befragten CDU/CSU-Wähler lehnen Trump ausdrücklich ab, ebenso wie 84,6 Prozent der befragten SPD-Wähler und 78,3 Prozent der FDP-Wähler. Bei den Wählern der Linkspartei sprachen sich hingegen lediglich 72,5 Prozent der Befragten ausdrücklich gegen Trump aus.
  ...
  Demnach sehen 36,7 Prozent der Muslime den neuen US-Präsidenten positiv, bei den Katholiken hingegen nur 9,9 % und bei den Protestanten 11,3 Prozent. Weniger als die Hälfte der befragten Muslime (47,7 Prozent) lehnt Trump ausdrücklich ab; bei den Katholiken  liegt dieser Wert bei 71,4 Prozent und bei den Protestanten bei 73,6 Prozent. My translation, annotations about the parties in brackets are mine. Seats in the ""Bundestag"" (Parliament) from Wikipedia: Of the voters, the approval rating among the AfD [far right party, 89 seats (12.6%)] voters are by far the highest with 52.9 percent. The lowest approval rating is among the voters of Bündnis90/Die Grünen [green party, 67 seats (9.4%)] (2.9 percent). 81 percent of the CDU/CSU [christian democrats, center right, 246 seats (34.7%)] explicitly refuse Trump, just like 84.6 percent of the SPD [social democrats, center left party, 152 seats (21.4%)] voters and 78.3 percent of the FDP [economic liberal party, 80 seats (11.3%)] voters. Among the voters of the Linkspartei [left party, 69 seats (9.7%)] only 72.5 percent refused Trump.

  36.7 percent of the muslims view the US president positively, among the catholics only 9.9 percent and the protestants 11.3 percent. Less than 47.7 percent of the muslims explicitly reject Trump; among the catholics it's 71.4 percent and for the protestants 73.6 percent.  So in summary: So correlating from that data: I have difficulty figuring out reasons for the religious approval rating since his anti-muslim stance should lead to higher disapproval among muslims, but the opposite is the case. It should be noted however that religion in Germany plays a very minor role among Christians, especially outside of the state of Bavaria. Taking another poll from YouGov for the DPA (Deutsche Presse Agentur/German Press Agency): US-Präsident Donald Trump wird in Deutschland als größere Gefahr für den Weltfrieden wahrgenommen als Russlands Staatschef Wladimir Putin oder der nordkoreanische Machthaber Kim Jong Un. Nach einer Umfrage des Meinungsforschungsinstituts YouGov im Auftrag der Deutschen Presse-Agentur (DPA) wird Trump auch für gefährlicher gehalten als das politische und religiöse Oberhaupt des Irans, Ajatollah Ali Chamenei, und Chinas Präsident Xi Jinping.
  41 Prozent der Befragten sagten, Trump sei von diesen fünf Persönlichkeiten die größte Gefahr für den Weltfrieden. 17 Prozent entschieden sich für Kim, jeweils 8 Prozent für Putin und Chamenei sowie 7 Prozent für Xi Translation again mine US president Donald Trump is viewed in Germany as a bigger danger for world peace than Russian president Vladimir Putin or the Northkorean Leader Kim Jong Un. In a Poll from YouGov for the Deutsche Presse-Agentur (DPA) Trump is viewed as more dangerous than the political and religios leader of Iran, Ajatolla Ali Chamenei, and Chinas president Xi jinping.
  41 percent of the respondents answered that Trump was the biggest danger for world peace among those five leaders. 17 percent decided for Kim, 8 percent each for Putin and Chamenei and 7 percent for Xi This leads me to the conclusion that his erratic behavior, combined with his power to actually mess up the world peace as the leader of the country with the biggest military, is viewed as very dangerous by Germans. Justifying the poll results from my personal view:
Germany has been dealing closely with Vladimir Putin for years and we have good trade relations with China, so both are known factors and chances are that the future with them will be business as usual. Putin is a known evil, we don't trust him but we also know that he's as rational as it gets. Xi is interested in economic power and war is bad for trade, so while the human rights violations and the Taiwan situation are bad, he wont endanger world peace. Kim Jong Un has been blustering for a long time, but, while he could kill a lot of people, he's more interested in staying in power than starting a war, so he's unlikely to mess up world peace. Iran was under very close observation where nuclear technology was concerned, so, while they do plenty of unsavory stuff, they don't have the power to actually disrupt world peace. They cause regional instability, but that's pretty much all they can do. So while those four are bad and/or evil, they aren't world peace shattering bad.
With Trump, he has the power to really, really mess up world peace. His behavior is unpredictable, so we can't rely on him to not mess it up at some point. There is a lot of uncertainty in dealing with Trump, which makes Germans anxious."
Why isn't Election Day a federal holiday in the US?,"In some states, election day is a holiday. The counter argument you are looking for is that the federal government shouldn't dictate how states implement their elections. If the states wish to declare their own civic holidays on election day they are free to do so, without the federal government requiring it and the corresponding loss of productivity from anyone else who doesn't want the holiday. Other states solve the issue differently, for instance Colorado, Oregon, and Washington hold their elections via the postal system. Legislators can argue that the loss of economic activity due to the closing of businesses adversely affect the state, and other avenues of solving the problem of lack of participation are available. Another alternative solution proposed would be to move the current election day to always land on November 11th, which happens to be Veterans Day and is already a federal holiday that is widely observed. This can be done without taking the step of declaring election day itself a holiday around the same time in November when elections are generally held, and a lot of people already have the day off of work so there will be less work hours lost than having a separate holiday. Additionally, the left-leaning Slate published an article pointing out that, even though many people would get the day off, other certain types of establishments that don't generally close for federal holidays still won't benefit because they won't observe the holiday. (Inc.com also published a similar argument.) Restaurants, retail, healthcare, all are businesses that generally get inundated with customers on other federal holidays, causing those industries an undue strain on the same day where their workers would need time off to go to polls also. Still further, the problem of low-income voters not voting may be an XY-problem. Perhaps it's not because they can't get the time off to vote, but rather they don't believe voting would do them any good if they did, making the exercise not worthwhile in their eyes. If their employer closes in deference to a holiday, they may be adversely affected financially against their will. One final observation is that there is more to an election than just the day of voting. The only holiday we're talking about is the day of the actual election, but counting primaries and run-offs there could be more days throughout the year that require voter participation. These elections are arguably more important, since they determine who gets to appear on the ballot. Creating a federal holiday for the election won't encourage people to participate in choosing who is available in the pool of candidates to pick from."
Could Donald Trump reverse Chelsea Manning's commutation?,"No. The power of a Presidential Pardon comes from the Constitution (Article II, Section 2) and there is no provision for undoing it."
"Why won't Donald Trump do something about ""fake news""?","Because of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution: Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. (emphasis mine) This constitutional restriction makes it extremely difficult for the United States government to exert any control over the media. Besides, you can also spread false stories without lying. For example, take this story: An anonymous source just told us that Politics.SE moderator Philipp kicked his dog. That didn't say that I did do that. Just that an anonymous source said I did. Can you prove that no anonymous source said this? No? Then you cannot prove that this statement is false.  Now you could prove that the information that I kicked a dog is false, so the news network is guilty of spreading a piece of false information. But what about this news: President Donald J. Trump just said that the murder rate in the United States is the highest in 47 years. It turns out Trump was wrong and it isn't. Is the news network guilty of spreading misinformation? It's the exact same situation. They reported on a statement being made, and that statement turned out to be false."
Why is Fox News the most viewed news channel in the US?,"Because there is only one Fox News and there are multiple competitors.  Overall, CNN and MSNBC together are watched more than Fox (source).  But they split the liberal viewership.  So if they get 34% and 21% of overall viewership and Fox gets 45%, Fox is the most watched single network even as it is a minority of the overall market.   If someone started a serious competitor for Fox viewers, that could reduce Fox's share.  Or if MSNBC went out of business, most of their watchers would probably go to CNN.  But as it is, they split the liberal market while Fox has the conservative market to itself.   Some sources for the partisanship:  "
Why do members of Congress in committee hearings ask witnesses the same question multiple times?,"You're assuming that the questions are asked solely for the public record. Here's another reason... Members of Congress want video of themselves asking good questions that will be broadcast by their local news media and / or used in campaign commercials. And another... Often times you'll notice that committee seats are empty during hearings. That's because members come and go during the hearing. It's possible that one member asks a question that was asked by another member earlier in the day before the first member arrived. (Although I don't think that was the case in the Cohen hearing, as the entire committee seemed to be present for the duration.)"
Why are conservatives so patriotic and hateful of the government at the same time?,"Conservatives don't see the government as the ""the country."" To quote Ronald Reagan in his inaugural address  So, as we begin, let us take inventory. We are a nation that has a government—not the other way around. And this makes us special among the nations of the Earth.  Conservative love of their nation is independent of its current government.  Looking at a speech from Ted Cruz  The idea that -- the revolutionary idea that this country was founded
  upon, which is that our rights don’t come from man. They come from God
  Almighty. And that the purpose of the Constitution, as Thomas
  Jefferson put it, is to serve as chains to bind the mischief of
  government. The incredible opportunity of the American dream, what has enabled
  millions of people from all over the world to come to America with
  nothing and to achieve anything. And then the American exceptionalism
  that has made this nation a clarion voice for freedom in the world, a
  shining city on a hill. Conservatives think what makes America special is that its government is restrained. The American dream doesn't come from what government does, it comes from what its government can't do. What's great about America is what its people do, its government often just gets in the way.  The other key component to understanding this issue is that conservatives in America are not anti-government. When it comes to national security they are very pro-government. Much of the celebration of patriotism in America is centered around its armed forces who conservatives see as constantly making heroic sacrifices for the freedom of Americans and people around the world. For an example of how conservatives see the armed forces, see this speech by George W. Bush or basically any other speech by a conservative American politican. We have seen the character of this new generation of American armed
  forces. We've seen their daring against ruthless enemies and their
  decency to an oppressed people. Millions of Americans are proud of our
  military, and so am I. I am honoured to be the commander in chief. I want to thank everybody in uniform who is here today: thank you for
  your service, your sacrifice, and your love of America. When a conservative says he loves America, he's saying he loves the natural human institutions that a limitied government have allowed to grow. He loves the churches, communities, families, and busineses that flourish when they are protected but not controlled. He is grateful to the parts of his government that stay within their limited mandate of protection laid out in the constitution; like the armed forces. When he's upset at the government (as he often is), he's upset at it overreaching its mandate. He's mad because that government action hurts the free society he loves. He doesn't love America because it has the worlds best government, he loves America because a restrained government has led to a flourishing society. He wants to conserve that society by protecting it from misguided government action."
Why do candidates not quit if they no longer have a realistic chance to win in the 2020 US presidents election,"Most of them are just trying to gain national exposure and recognition. A highly-charged primary cycle is a perfect way to do it. Probably, one of the losing candidates will be offered the Vice-President nomination. Also, some of the other candidates may be offered Cabinet positions. Some other candidates will gain enourmous amounts of local recognition which can be used for future (and possibly even 2020 depending on when they drop out) Senate runs. Candidates like Steve Bullock, Pete Buttigieg, Beto O'Rourke, John Hickenlooper are good examples of this. "
