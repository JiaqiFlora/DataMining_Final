How to deal with excluding my son from the favourite activity of his peers?,"When I was around your son's age, my mother was worried I was playing too many video games.  Her strategy was to get me involved in other after-school activities, like theater, which I ended up loving.  As long as this is your child's only peer group, and that is their only activity, the game will be irresistible.  He'll need something else to fill the gap --music, or sports, or art --and other kids to be around, whose parents have made similar decisions as you have.  The peer group is EVERYTHING at this age.  (You also could probably benefit from the moral support of a group of like-minded parents.)   If he does develop other interests, it's possible you might eventually be able to relax the rules without him going crazy.  For what it's worth, even though my mother never actually forbade video games for me, I just never got as deeply into them as my peers, because I had so many other things I was interested in. I won't claim I never went through the occasional video game binge, but it never lasted.  I'm pursuing a similar strategy with my own kids (a little younger than yours) and it seems to be working out so far. (Although nowadays my mother seems completely unconcerned about letting my kids play games at her house --go figure!) NOTE: Based on edits to the original question, plus comments made on this one, I ended up posting a second answer that suggests ways to try to work with the other parents affected, instead of giving up on this peer group.  I'm leaving this answer here because I think this may still be the best solution for some parents with similar situations to the OP."
How to prevent my child from being indoctrinated with Christianity? [duplicate],"Well, I would first try not to indoctrinate him myself. If you want him to make a conscious choice, you probably should be very careful with your reactions. I'm myself agnostic but coming from a Christian culture. My 6 year old girl goes into a non-confessional school but yet manages to talk to me about Jesus and so (we're in Belgium, so a country that is traditionally rather Christian). I try to be careful myself not to tell her things like ""this is just a funny story"". When asked about religion(s), Jesus, and so on I try to be as neutral as possible with speeches like: A lot of people think there is a god, some think there are many gods, some others believe there is no god at all, and some other just don't know. Daddy is part of these people who don't know. I'm also very keen on extending some explanations about who Jesus is for the Christians and so on, within the limit of my own knowledge. I'm quite sure in the future if more questions arise I will invite her to look for the answers herself.
Now I must admit this neutral position might be harder to hold when your kid is constantly exposed to things like preachings, but I consider it very important to really let her the free choice of her own convictions, and even to change it as she evolves. As a side remark, I must admit I don't know the German situation at all, but I'm really surprised by what you describe and the impossibility to find a non-confessional kindergarten."
Teenage daughter refusing to go to school,"(Background: I saw this question on SE and am answering from an anonymous account because of personal details). I'm not a parent but feel the need to post because this resonated strongly with me. Your daughter sounds like she's otherwise a normal, bright and happy teenage girl, with no major problems except for this school attendance issue. It's also obvious that the extent of her dislike for school is far beyond a typical teenage rebellion or desire to skip class. Please also understand I am not trying to worry you with this answer. What you describe sounds very much like she's being abused at school. Most likely severe bullying by other pupils, but it's also possible that the staff are to blame either because they actively participate in the abuse or willfully ignore the abuse from pupils. While she obviously has to attend school, I think her attendance is less important than the underlying issues now - she can catch up academically later on anything she misses due to low attendance, but there's a real possibility that being at school is now harmful to her. At the age of 12-13, I acted quite similarly to what you describe. Due to the school system back then, I didn't have to physically resist going to school, but it was possible for me to fake attendance, to which I devoted a lot of effort. I rarely went to class, was evasive on any school-related subjects with my parents, and was particularly evasive regarding various material possessions (there were no lockers or such though). PE was my biggest problem and I skipped PE lessons for a year, even on days when I otherwise went to class. This is why your daughter's behaviour sounds familiar. My issues were primarily caused by bullying from other kids, with most of the staff silently ignoring it. I was constantly verbally and psychologically bullied, with occasional attacks on my possessions - my bag or books would be stolen or damaged, once my schoolbag was stolen and then thrown at a teacher's head out of the window, attempting to frame me for that. PE lessons were when the bullying quite consistently was worse, even getting physical. I had sometimes had my clothes stolen or destroyed, and of course PE, due to its nature, provided plenty of opportunity to do things like ""accidentally"" hitting me in the face, over the head, tripping me over, and so on. The PE teacher was, as I understand now, also an adult that shouldn't have worked with children - the teacher would often verbally humiliate me and make jokes at my expense (I was a kid with a small build and mediocre coordination). This is why PE eventually became the focal point of my school problems and I started skipping it entirely - and I was definitely willing to violently resist had anyone tried dragging me to PE. I strongly suspect your daughter is experiencing something similar. If she's being bullied, the bullying could also be centered around sensitive issues. Having slight body issues is not too uncommon for a girl her age, but bullying could turn those into severe issues, such as her being afraid of her overall chest shape being seen. I also find the school's behaviour very worrying. If they know about her problems from you, and are themselves being evasive about lockers and threatening to prosecute your family, then it's possible that the school is covering something up, such as the staff knowing about the bullying but neglecting it. Your daughter may benefit from a therapist. Assuming my guess is correct, she really needs to feel safe - which she doesn't at school. She needs to be fully aware that your first priority is her general well-being and not her grades or attendance right now. Ultimately, you need to get her to a point where she's comfortable telling you the truth, even if it is that she's being abused at school and threatened against talking about it or even changing schools. My suggestions, specifically: Do not assume the school has her best interests at heart, don't assume that she is safe at school (mentally first and foremost). If she has any good friends at school, talk to them in private. Ask them if they have any idea that could help you. I specifically mean her friends, not their parents - if there's a major problem, her same-age friends may have noticed something but their parents would likely not know. Look into appropriate therapists who could help your daughter talk. She might find it easier to open up to a stranger. Let her know, very explicitly, that you will not blame her for any problems other may cause her, and that your first priority is her well-being and safety. Let her know you're willing to send her to a different school or do anything else that may help her. She may be almost ready to tell you the truth but be too afraid of your reaction."
The teacher erased 3 pages of my 5 year old's completed homework,"This teacher is carefully producing a future math-hater.  I've worked with enough high school students to know. I've also worked with enough people in personal counseling to know that whether you care to face it or not, this sort of work is NOT accidental.  This is a deliberate, even if unconscious, effort to sabotage your child's learning. At that age the MOST important asset your child has school-wise is a love of learning.  Nothing can substitute for that.  A teacher who will destroy a love of learning in pursuit of a perfectly written piece of homework—entirely invalidating the careful hours your son put in to do a good job—is valuing form over content to the point of insanity.  One could also say it is valuing mechanics over purpose; whatever you call it, it is totally counter-productive. Personally, I value my son highly, and I respect his rights and dignity as a person.  I would remove him immediately from the influence and power of this teacher. When I was very young (about 8 years old), my parents sent me to a new school.  It was supposed to be an excellent school, with an excellent curriculum, etc., etc.  I only went for a semester, and then (to my relief) I went to another, smaller school where I enjoyed myself much more and where, even though the curriculum wasn't as jammed with ""high value subjects,"" I learned a lot more a lot faster.  And had more fun.  I subsequently finished 4th, 5th and 6th grades in the same year, and went on to graduate High School (12 grades) by the age of 13. Years later, talking to my mother, I found out why she had taken me out of that prestigious new school after only one semester.  It was because she found out I didn't like going there.  That was the only reason. (Thank you, mom.) You know your child.  You care more for your child than anyone else on the planet, and you know what is best for your child.  Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.  If you don't like the approach used by that school, don't let your child be subjected to it."
My 3 year old daughter thinks she is white. Should I tell her she's not?,"While I believe @RoryAlsop's answer is the best approach, I do appreciate that things might be a little more complicated for you in the American South, where there is a strong history of discrimination based on the color of one's skin. I don't know what it's like where you live, but there's no harm (I believe) in beginning gentle discussions of history, and that the current thought should be that we are not ""better"" or ""worse"" based on the color of our skin. If you live in an area that still has discrimination, and you're worried that your daughter may be hearing about it/experiencing it already, the time has come to start building her moral compass about 'color'. The world is full of examples of non-white heroes. Not knowing exactly the situation, if you think there might be some talk already, start discussing (on her level) the works of great people of all races, including white. If she grows up in a loving family that doesn't care about the color of one's skin, she will better be able to ignore or answer those who do when the time comes."
What can I as a teenager do about my insanely strict parents?,"Sit them down for a big, honest conversation. Don't make it about what you want, though. Make it about what they want, and especially ask them, honestly, how they think what they are doing right now is preparing you for your adult life. Ask them how they think you'll be able to handle the adult life when you head out to college with zero prep. Ask them what they think will happen when you are free to go out and hang out with whomever you want at college but you have zero experience to tell apart the nice guys and the dangerous guys. What happens when you suddenly have uncontrolled access to the internet when you've never used it before. Clearly, they are worried about these things. But they have about 3 more years in which they can shield you, and then they will be letting you go into the world with zero preparation. Ask them honestly what they think will happen. If they claim that they are raising you to resist these temptations, remind them that you aren't being raised, you are being forced, and you aren't given any opportunities to learn for yourself. Remind them that you disagree with their stance, and the only reason you're behaving as they want is because they make you, and that you won't behave the same way as soon as their oversight is gone. And remind them that young people screw up a lot while figuring out how life works. The smaller the situation, the smaller the danger. Right now, if you hang out with friends or on a date, they'll be nearby to come pick you up if anything is wrong. (If they give you a phone, anyway). If you're in college, far away from them, you'll be on your own. The only thing that'll protect you there, is your experiences growing up. Worst situation, remind them that you will be free to go even if they don't want you to when you turn 18. Since this sounds like a threat, you'll want to avoid it if at all possible, but if they don't realize it, it might help to point it out. And finally; if the above makes it sound like you'll be in a really hard position when you leave for college, well, you will be. Don't let it deter you, though. Life requires a lot of experience, including a bunch of bad ones, and you'll have a lot of catching up to do... but you need to do it someday. The earlier the better."
"Should I punish my teenage sister, whom I have full custody of, for lying to me in order to secretly see her boyfriend?","Your sister got herself into a situation that she felt she needed to lie about. She could have continued doing that in the hope that she never got caught out, or until some crisis point where she was found out involuntarily. But instead, she chose to take the tough decision and confess to you, to allow things to be better in the future. She took the adult path of dealing with an uncomfortable situation actively: despite the immediate negative consequences of admitting her past behaviour, she wanted to be open with you and resolve the problem. In behavioural psychology, we term a ""punishment"" as something that reduces the frequency of a target behaviour, as opposed to a reinforcer, which increases the frequency of a behaviour. In this case, you want to reinforce her (impressively) good behaviour: her brave decision to admit to past misdeeds and to involve you actively in this new part of her life. Focus on that, rather than on punishment of the earlier behaviour. In your discussions, feel free to say how the deception was wrong or hurtful, but emphasise how much you value that she was brave enough to resolve that openly, and that she trusts you enough to do that.  Repay that trust: from now on, she will be dealing with many other adult-level problems. The key thing is to say that you hope she can be open with you from the beginning in the future. If that is to happen, she needs to see that her openness and honesty is received positively by you. So in essence, discuss the past deception openly but don't attempt to punish it. Focus on reinforcing her newly honest approach. Lastly, given your own age, what a wonderful thing to be doing to take on the responsibility of raising a teenager. I hope you'll be receiving a lot of positive reinforcement for this yourself."
My girlfriend has mentioned disowning her 14 y/o transgender daughter,"How do I best protect Emily ... from the bullying she's experiencing from [her mother]? You are in a tricky situation.  It's very likely that you will lose your girlfriend and Emily over this issue if you do not somehow figure out how to support both parent and child.  Given that you are not Emily's father, nor her mother's husband, you have absolutely no legal rights in this situation. As such I believe you have two very difficult tasks. First you need to make sure that mom feels safe and comfortable staying with you.  If this argument escalates to the point where she believes she will lose control of her child's life, it's unlikely that she will choose you over her child.  You understand your relationship better than I, so perhaps you can weigh the risks better, but pushing against mom might not actually help Emily.  It may be that Emily's best chance is if you support mom in slowing down Emily's transition so that it can happen at all.  Going slowly is better than Mom and Emily leaving and not having any support at all. Second you need to support Emily and help her to see the advantage to moving more slowly.  She may have been considering this for months or years, and she may be ready.  It may be true that she shouldn't have to wait for others to become ready.  But unlike abortion - where in some jurisdictions you can undergo a medical procedure without a parent's knowledge or permission - sexual transition therapy is not something that can be done by herself without her mother's knowledge and permission.  Not legally at any rate. Further, she's only 14, and she's making a decision that will irreversibly change her life.  While it's an important time to make the transition if that's the decision, it's equally important to make sure it's the right decision.  So at this juncture it may be best to help her understand that she's got her whole life ahead of her, and she can go through this process more slowly.  Jumping in all at once may not be in her best interest, given her mother's opposition. If you can thread the needle, so to speak, you have a much better chance of being able to support Emily throughout this transition than you do if you actively oppose her mother's decisions for her child. ...should [I] be taking steps to become Emily's legal guardian...? I don't think you have any real chance.  If you can show real harm to Emily - as in the treatment of her mother fits the legal family court definition of child abuse - then you might have a possible chance, but you might also find that her mother shuts you out of the process legally and Emily instead ends up in foster care or with other relatives.  In either case you lose influence in this situation. If you have any desire to do anything legally you should consult with a good family law lawyer. It may well be that in some particular areas of the country courts and judges will be sympathetic to the plight of transgender teens and award guardianship to non relatives, but I wouldn't suggest this to either Emily or your girlfriend until you have spoken with a lawyer and understand the likelihood.  If Emily knew you were pursuing this, she may get a false sense of hope, or tell her mother in the heat of argument.  Once mom finds out you are even considering taking control of any part of Emily's life without mom's consent or approval I believe you will lose both."
I am 21 and I am terrified beyond belief of my father,"You are 21. You are an adult under Egyptian law. If you need missing papers, you can apply for them without having a guardian. You only need someone to vouch that you live with them, which brings us to: Do you have any person you trust you can talk to? Can this person shelter you or provide you with shelter elsewhere? Don't go to Churches: You surely know about the problems caused by convert girls in the past. A church might very well send you back to avoid the dilemma (and the angry mob that your father will have no problem in mobilising). Which brings us to, Don't go to Mosques: Unless you know the people personally, which given Islamic tradition is not the case for you as a woman, don't trust them. They might be good people, but they might consider what you do disobedience to the parent. You don't want to take that risk. Instead, check out nearby organisations that are involved with women's rights. A friend active in that regard suggested http://etijah.org/arabic/ to me. It concerns itself with forced marriages and combatting prevention of girls to study. Could you contact them? Seek out similar organisations in your vicinity. Speak with them. They surely have experience in that regard. I read the post to my father and here's what he has to say (unaltered): What about your uncles or aunts? Anyone you can confide in, who could find you a suitable husband? I found this facebook page which concerns iteself with freedom of travel for Egyptian women. I contacted them and they seem eager to assist. That's the most I can suggest with the information you gave. I urge you not to give out too much information. I never been to parenting.SE but this post is in the hot questions bar for all sites on the Stack Exchange network.  I wish you the best. If you are really desperate, create a throw-away email account and message me at the email address in the comments with a proof that shows that the parenting.SE account is yours. If you are fine with disclosing what governorate you are in, I can ask acquaintances what organisations are there (I am egyptian myself although living abroad at the moment) or try to help otherwise. I know the last suggestion isn't fit for the Q&A format, but neither is the question and I think in this case it's appropriate to offer this."
"I'm losing it, with a talkative toddler, a colicky baby, chores, work, and lack of sleep","Ok. I'm going to take a shot at this. I semi-agree with Erica's comment that this could be seen as primarily opinion based but at the same time, it's not and there are methods out there that we parents can share with each other in order to better enable ourselves to handle times like these. The first thing that you need to understand is that this is temporary. This is a realization that has gotten me through many rough times even beyond parenting. My first tooth filling (hate the dentist), my first week of boot camp (arguably the worst), my deployment to Iraq (not fun), my first surgery (and the resulting pain), and (to stay on-topic) the first time having two children in the same house screaming for two different things at the exact same time. These moments are temporary, fleeting, and will be done before you know it. It sounds to me like you two need a break. Not even a date night. Nothing romantic (unless you need that too) but honestly, just a break. Find someone who is fine to watch your kids for a couple of hours and take a nap. In this situation I would find two people to watch both kids separately. One who is good with babies and another who can play with and exhaust your oldest. Get some good quality sleep even if you have to pay for a babysitter and do it sooner than later. Sleep is very important. As much as you want to, don't retreat into your work. I thought I could do this but in the end couldn't bring myself to stay away (plus I had a coworker who wouldn't let me). Be there for these times and rough it out. I know it sucks now but these are character defining moments and, if you see it through, they make your family stronger. The most difficult piece of advice I can give you is clear your plate. Drop some things off of your schedule. Anything that is absolutely not necessary, dump it now. Maintaining absolutely unnecessary activities is difficult and if they're currently adding to your stress then drop them.  The last piece of advice I can give you is to love your family. Love them unconditionally. I'm going to say it and I hope no one takes offense; sometimes children can be a pain in the ass. Despite this though, I have always loved them beyond measure. One day (soon) you'll look at both of them and realize what a gift they are and this time right here will seem all worth it."
What to do with my pre-teen daughter who has been out of control since a severe accident?,"I've tried and tried to get her to go to counseling but only response I get you can make me go but don't expect me to say a word. So, make her go. Therapists have a way of getting people to talk, and while it may not ""cure"" her, it certainly can't hurt. I'm not excusing her behavior; I'm sure it's extremely painful and confusing. From her perspective, though, her whole family (unless there are others) died/almost died and she got out with relatively little damage. That age is hard to begin with, then something very bad happened. She lost her father, and her brother as she knew him, and almost lost you. She may have severe abandonment issues, survivor's guilt, etc. But it's clear she has a lot of unresolved emotional conflict over the event.  She needs an outside party, preferably a professional, to discuss her feelings with. It's incredibly boring to sit in a room without talking for 50 minutes. It's very likely she'll start to talk, and when she does, she'll be talking with someone who knows some ways to help her. I don't think this is something you should try to deal with alone. Give her this and a lot of time (the fact that she's still getting As in school and cheering is a good sign.) You might also consider visiting a therapist yourself to help you understand possible reasons for your daughter's (re)actions, and help with how to cope with the hurtful behavior she's exhibiting. This is the only advice I can think of to give. I wish you all peace."
My 13-year-old son made a foolish and wasteful donation. How can I teach him he was wrong?,"Donate the left shoes in the same donation box. Whether or not they are able to get single shoes to those who need them, having a half-pair sit in your son's closet does nobody any good. Might as well finish what he started. By only giving right shoes, he has potentially wasted the charity's time: many people need only one shoe, but there's a chance this particular charity doesn't serve that need. (Thrift stores, for example, typically sell whole pairs. Whether they would re-donate single shoes depends on the charity.) Take the opportunity to teach him about why shoe donations are needed, who will benefit from those shoes, and so on.  Buy one pair of shoes from the organization that runs the donation box. If you can't figure that out, or there isn't one near you, any thrift store will do! He does need to have shoes, but they don't have to be fancy and
they definitely don't have to be expensive. Optional. Have him work off the cost of future new shoes in chores and odd jobs around the house. You set the rate, he does the work.  Ultimately, your goal should be to help teach the value of things he owns. A parent goes to work to get a paycheck, which eventually becomes shoes, food, housing, and so on. Having that be discarded (even in a ""positive"" way like donating to charity) is understandably hurtful as a parent: not only is the physical object being undervalued, but your effort and care in providing for him was not acknowledged and considered. (""That was $600 of shoes. That's a lot of full-time work for me/other-parent, just to pay for shoes. I'm hurt you think that's so worthless."") Having him put in some work to get the next few pairs of nicer shoes is going to help drive that point home."
How to comfort my dad after telling him that I don't like to do anything with him?,"It's so hard for parents when their children start to pull away. We may be parents, but we are also human beings. It hurts, even when we try not to show it. We question ourselves and if we are doing things ""right"".  I remember when my oldest boy (he is now 20) stopped wanting to go to the movies with me. I was very upset; it was ""our thing"". It was an interest we both shared and I cherished that time together. I took it personally. Why didn't he want to hang out with me anymore? Did he stop liking me? What did I do wrong?  But then someone pointed out something I had never thought about before...Wouldn't I be more concerned if I were the only one he wanted to hang out with...now that would be weird for a 16-year-old boy to only want to hang out with his mother...awkward!  If you want to talk to him, create a situation. Like...at the dinner table or go for a walk together. Start by asking a question, like ""hey dad, can we try doing something new together?"" or ""Dad why are you so stressed out, I'm worried?"" Might be a good one right now.  It's so hard for parents to talk to their children once they're no longer children.  You're not a child. You're now a young adult and it's going to be hard for both you and your dad to make that crucial switch over. You're not his little boy anymore and he's not your daddy. You're a young man and he's your Father.  It kind of just sounds like you're stuck in the same routine and need a little switch up. Now when I see my son, it's dinner with his girlfriend and more adult conversation. We're friends. I'm not his mommy anymore :)  I truly hope this helps. Just remember to be kind to your father. We are just people trying to do the best we can...we don't really know what we're doing, we're just trying our best and sometimes it helps to get a little feedback from those we love so much. In the end, we ALL want the same thing. Happiness. We want our children to be happy and we want to be happy for them.  Best of luck!"
How can you deal with tantrums without spanking?,"What we try to do with our two year old toddler is offer him some (limited) range of choices -- so that he can feel he is in control. So for example with the milk, you might let him decide: I believe at this toddler phase they are starting to become people, with their own wants and desires and need to exert control over the world... so when you let them ""decide"", even if it is a very constrained set of choices, this gives them an outlet for needing to be in control. Also, as far as tantrums goes, the best thing to do is ignore them and not respond to them so far as you can ... always ignore the behavior you don't want, and reward the behavior you do."
"If my 5yr old is an exceptional liar, should I expect that she will continue lying as she gets older?","My daughter, a few years older than yours, is also a skillful liar when she chooses to be.  My best advice is ""trust but verify.""  Children are good at knowing what works, and if lying is a reliable, consequence free way of getting what she wants, there's no reason --from her point of view --not to deploy it. (In contrast, my son rarely lies, probably not because of superior moral fiber, but because he's such a transparently bad liar!) At this point, I think my daughter has digested the lesson that gaining a reputation for lying results in the natural consequence being given a diminished amount of trust, which I think has helped.  If you know there's a consistent pattern of lies, and you still fall for it every time, the problem is really yours, not hers. Although I don't believe you can change a person's underlying personality, I do believe that virtues and values are very learnable.  The mistake is to believe that children will just pick those up naturally, without either being taught them explicitly or experiencing the consequences of not practicing them.  There's a reason previous generations spent so much time and effort explicitly teaching values (even if their methods were sometimes questionable).  We as adults might roll our eyes, but I've heard my children directly refer to stories like ""the boy who cried wolf"" when reminding each other to be honest."
Son was sent home from sleepover for behavior,"It is a learning opportunity, but for more than one person, especially your child and you. First, you need to get the whole story, and you can't get it all from your son; he may well not understand what the adult was expecting at the time. So speak to the adult.  I did say adult, but that is not the way an adult should handle the situation. Were it a sleepover at my house, and a child was misbehaving badly, I would not send a child home; I would sit down with them privately and go over what I expect of them (no hurting other kids, no name calling, etc.) Only if the child was truly hurtful again after a warning would I take a guest back to their house. Laughing while I (as an adult) was explaining something might get the kid a lecture, but not the boot. Sending a kid home for disrespecting an adult sends up all kinds of red flags to me.  Talk to your neighbor. Be careful to remain very neutral; if he feels judged, he may make things out to be worse than they were. Get as much detail as you can. Check in with your son. Compare the stories. Figure out to the best of your ability what likely happened, and who was more at fault for being ""disrespectful"", your son or your neighbor? Keep that in mind for the future. Have your son make a formal apology to your neighbor. An apology is more than just ""I'm sorry."" Have your son also name what he did wrong and have him assure the adult he won't do it again.  If that's not enough to put your son back in the neighbor's good graces, that's another red flag. Whatever you do, support your son where you can as well. He was humiliated in front of his friends (maybe he deserved it, but maybe not) and he came home crying. He has suffered.  Personally, I'm not in favor of of a blind ""respect authority"" approach. Please read about Adam Walsh for an extreme case, or any story of child abuse for an everyday example. Not all adults should be obeyed. Some adults should be steered clear of."
How can I prevent my 8-year-old from spending time with his bad friend?,"I think there are two problems here: Your child is friends with a kid who has learned some maladaptive behaviors/ideas and is passing them on to your child. You and your wife are apparently unaware of the social and cultural realities outside your own family. This isn't to say that you can fix the situation, but you'd have a better chance of doing so if you understand the situation.  I say this as someone who spent nearly a decade working with ""at risk"" kids. First of all, your family is not ""pretty typical"" outside your neighborhood.  38% of US households have at least one firearm.  98.9% of US households have television sets.  More than 2/3 of kids have video game systems at home, and 92% of children and adolescents ages 2-17 play video games (pdf).  61.5% of children aged 9--13 years do not participate in any organized physical activity during their nonschool hours and that 22.6% do not engage in any free-time physical activity.  I don't have stats on profanity usage, but asking around to a couple of teachers I know from middle-class neighborhoods, their 1st-3rd graders frequently require discipline for using profanity that is considered ""okay"" at home.  I could go on and on. I'm not saying that your family's values are wrong, just that they are not typical.    Most people walk around with the illusion that their values are the norm, simply because we tend to surround ourselves with people who share our values. You need to be aware of this because you seem not to recognize how foreign and hard to navigate your family's social scripts and values are to this kid. Imagine that you were 8 years old, and dropped on some remote island.  Everyone there spoke English and their houses looked about the same as yours, but their behavior was absolutely confounding.  These people gave wet willies as greetings, never ever used words like ""hey"" or ""wow"" or ""cool"" (and were terribly offended if you did) and thought you were potentially criminally violent because of your firm handshake (which in your culture is a sign of confidence and strength).  That's essentially what this kid feels like coming to your house -- your social rules are so different from the ones he was taught at home, even if he were 100% motivated to adapt it would take time and many mistakes.  How easy would it be for the islanders to convince 8yo you that ""wow"" is a horribly offensive cuss word, and handshakes are threatening? From this point on, I'm making some big assumptions because I don't know the child or the situation first hand, but here's what I suspect is happening: That an eight-year-old is mentioning suicide and homicide at all is concerning, but keep in mind that if it hasn't been explicitly taught to him, he doesn't really understand the gravity of those statements. You tried to reason an eight-year-old into making drastic behavioral changes based on cultural values he doesn't understand because he's had little to no exposure to them. To put it in perspective, my then-7yo, who'd studied martial arts for three years, was born on a military base, and whom I have taught to respect both barehanded martial arts and weapons could not wrap his head around the fact that the 6yo girl in his class who talked about getting a knife and stabbing people wasn't really going to try to kill anybody; she'd just seen a violent movie at a friend's house and didn't grok that knifing people was any more real than the energy weapons or space aliens in the movie.  She had no idea why my son was upset by her comments, even after the teacher explained it to her.  Some adults can't bridge those kinds of cultural disconnects -- almost no young children can. The child is probably acting the way he does for some combination of the following reasons: Without having nearly enough information to jump to conclusions here, I'm going to give some advice based on the conclusions I just jumped to above -- take it with a grain of salt: You can't ""fix"" a kid who has a very dysfunctional home life unless you remove him from that home life -- something you obviously can't do.  You can probably mitigate his behavior in your home, which might even help the kid a little, but doing so will be labor intensive. No matter what you do, this kid will probably be a bad influence on your kids in some small ways.  He can't magically undo your parenting and turn your children into sociopaths, though. If you decide that you can live with the bad influence because the friendship is that important to your son, you need to take a two-pronged approach: take steps to keep this child's behavior from being adopted by your children, and take steps to improve how this child behaves around your family. Sit down with all three kids (the neighbor kid and your kids) and explain to them your household rules, and that everyone in the house must follow them.  Explain that you want to do fun things with them, but that that will not work if they keep getting into time-out over bad behavior. Never, EVER allow your children to go over to this kid's house.  Who knows what is going on over there. Make play dates structured play dates, with a parent participating at all  times.  Do things this kid probably wouldn't get to do at home, like bake cookies together, build a bonfire outside and roast marshmallows (S'mores++), have a cool craft project ready to go, put up a tent in the back yard (or living room for that matter) and tell ghost stories.  This way the kid has real incentive to love being at your house despite what he will see as weird and pointless behavior rules, you can easily monitor behavior and nip problems in the bud with a time-out the instant they appear, and you are modelling good behavior and providing responsible adult attention in ways he probably doesn't get at home. DO NOT let bad behavior go in the name of ""love and understanding"" -- anything you allow to happen you are implicitly endorsing.  The same goes for your kids -- if you don't hold them to the same strict rules this kid will see it as persecution rather than enforcement. Watch and listen and try to figure out what is important to this kid.  Maybe he wants to be a scientist when he grows up, maybe he just wants to learn how to fit in at school -- every kid is different, but if you put the time in you can usually find the motivation for them to want to be and do better, not just to please you but of their own accord. Enroll your kids in a good martial arts program.  In addition to discipline, dexterity, diligence, the ability to take criticism well, confidence, and a bunch of other great things kids can learn in martial arts, kids learn things like how to identify the difference between playfighting and real aggression, the same visceral aversion to even suggestions of inappropriate violence that my son has, and a good frame of reference for how to handle the kinds of situations this kid has put your son in with his comments."
My wife wants a homosexual child,I would strongly suggest some couple therapy before you bring a child into this situation.  I worked in a therapy clinic and saw the outcome of overbearing/unreasonable mothering (and fathering).  Your wife needs to confront her own issues before she tries re-wiring a child to fit her agenda.
"Limit access to screens (phone, computer) to my kids, whereas I benefitted from ""no limit"" during my own childhood","My situation is very similar to what you describe: we have multiple kids — one of whom is 9, one slightly older, and one slight younger — I grew up with mostly ""unlimited"" computer access (though for me it was the 80s, so no interwebs — I didn't even have a modem); and I, too, struggle with the disparity between what I was allowed to do (or should I say, ""what I did"") and what we allow our children to do (screen time, that is. I'm far more comfortable with how much chocolate I eat vs how much we let the kids have 😸 ). With that in mind, here are some thoughts: Here's how we deal with all of this: The kids get 30 minutes (max) of open-ended screen time per day. This can be watching a show, playing a video game, whatever they want (that's age-appropriate). Their current obsession is worm / snake games (e.g. http://wormax.io/ ) which are really just Tron Light Cycles, or to go even farther back, Surround (for the Atari 2600), but much better. (and regarding the single vs multi-player discussion: these snake games are multi-player and you can ""friend"" people to form groups, but I don't think there's any communication between people; and our kids play at the same time so they're playing with each other as well as with people from all over). Reading time is mostly unlimited. While we do have lots of books, the kids have read them enough and want more. We used to go to the library weekly but that's much more difficult now due to COVID-19. We can still get books from the library, but not nearly as much or as often. So, tablets give them access to thousands of books and that really helps. (more on this in a moment) Programming/creative time: generally no more than 2 hours at a time. Might do more than 2 hours in a day, but needs to be broken up with going outside, reading, lunch/dinner, etc. The kids have really gotten into Scratch (Google and MIT project, I believe). It's really cool, and a great way to get kids into programming (there's also https://code.org/ and https://bitsbox.com/). With Scratch time we sometimes require an hour of programming / creative time before they can play games. But playing Scratch games isn't really treated as video games because they end up finding something they want to copy (either part of a game, a technique, or maybe an entire game to modify) and it leads to creative time in a natural way. That, and video games do help with hand-eye coordination (another reason to prefer them over passively watching TV). Outside time: weather permitting, the kids are required to run around outside for 30 - 60 minutes per day (play soccer, tag, catch, whatever). For the books, and partly for the video game time, we have Kindle Fire Kid's Edition tablets (from Amazon). Kid's Edition comes with a year of Freetime Unlimited which can be renewed for something like $75 - $80 per year after that. ""Freetime Unlimited"" has worked out well for us because not only does it provide access to thousands of books (and tons of games if they want to use the tablet for game time, but lately it's all about those snakes), but it also lets you limit the amount of time they can use the tablet, and for what types of activities. So we set them up to be 30 minutes max for games/apps, unlimited time for reading, and 0 minutes for movies, and no web/browser access (I do recall one kid coming home from school, 3rd grade, telling us that a classmate had watched DeadPool 2 on their tablet as the parents weren't home and the babysitter wasn't paying attention; good movie, though not as good as the first one, but certainly not for 8 year olds). As a consequence for fighting, being mean, and so many other ""fun"" things, we deduct minutes from the video game time (we deduct from the initial 30 minutes). The effectiveness of this varies per child, of course. As a reward for going above and beyond, we will add minutes to video game time (sadly, though not unexpectedly, this does not occur nearly as often as minutes getting deducted). We're able to control the device usage since all laptops and tablets stay in the living room (they'll just need to wait to see DeadPool, at least until highschool when they'll get more privacy ;-) None of this implies a lack of doing other things, such as Legos, arts + crafts, reading physical books, playing board games, yelling at each other about the most nonsensical stuff, etc Also keep in mind: It's not a perfect system, and it gets adjusted as needed, but it has been working for us for a while now. Just trying to find the right balance of educational/creative time, pure fun, exercise/movement, etc."
Should you let a toddler win?,"What makes a children's game a children's game is the element of chance generally greatly outweighing the element of strategy.  In other words, it doesn't take much for a child to win legitimately. I recently had the exact opposite experience as yours with my five year-old son.  He got a new game for Christmas where you flip over two cards to find a match.  I made a conscious decision not to let him win, and he didn't for the first 10 times or so we played.  When he finally did win, he was ecstatic because he knew I didn't just hand it to him.  Now he wins every third game or so, and he is learning both to win and lose graciously. When he gets old enough for games requiring more strategy, I still won't let him win, but I'll give myself a handicap to even the odds.  For example, when he learns chess I'll start out playing without a queen, but still do my best to win.  That way winning is a real accomplishment for either of us, and seeing my handicap reduce over time will be a real long term accomplishment for him. There's also the matter of the game needing to be fun for the adult in order for him to remain interested enough to continue playing.  When the deck is stacked against you, it ceases to be fun.  For example, when I play games with them, my stepdad frequently sacrifices his own position to help my mom win.  I don't know if she doesn't notice, or just doesn't care, but it certainly takes the fun out of it for me. I just read an interesting article on the subject.  It basically states that trying to always keep your kid happy often results in them becoming unhappy adults, because they are not equipped to deal with disappointment.  It's a long article, but well worth the read."
Seventeen year old daughter wants to take an international trip to meet someone she met online,"The way I see it there are two possibilities, either the story is true or it is not true. And in both cases your daughter needs your help. If you manage to prevent your daughter from going to see this friend and thus she never learns if all she was told was true or not, she is likely going to keep thinking it was all true and blame you that she lost this friend. Making your daughter understand that you are there to help her can be difficult. But maybe by being supportive in the right ways it may be possible. If the story is true, then the other girl's strict parents are obviously getting in the way of the two girls getting a chance to meet. And having your daughter go alone and the other girl try to sneak out without her parents knowing is clearly not a good idea. And even that could get your daughter into trouble once those strict parents learn what is happening. Instead I recommend you communicate directly with those parents to make arrangements for all of you to meet at a convenient time and place. If you do it that way you may be able to succeed in convincing your daughter you are helping deal with those strict parents rather than being another obstacle she has to get out of the way. That she may get to meet this friend a few months quicker by cooperating this way could help convince her that it is a better idea. If the entire story is true chances are the other girl's parents are just as concerned as you are which is why they are being so ""strict"". This also means that they are just as interested in making the first meeting happen in a safe location as you are. Should the entire thing turn out to be a scam you can be there once your daughter learns the truth. It may have cost you time and money to get to that point, but if it means your daughter will trust you more, it may have been worth it. Just make sure you don't spend more time and money on this than you can afford, and don't agree to meet that family in some dodgy location where you wouldn't have wanted to take your daughter in the first place."
"Wife agrees with parenting, but is intentionally less strict","I agree that this couple could probably benefit from some couples counseling. Mom is putting an unfair burden on dad and it may take some support from an outside party to help both parents understand how this might impact both their marriage and their child's future feelings about each of the parents.  In the meantime, however, even though you mentioned that both parents are usually together, I would suggest that Dad focus on only providing consequences for issues that he specifically witnesses and considers worthy of correction. It seems likely that the child does certain things that bother Mom and don't bother Dad. In that situation, Dad should never step in in place of Mom.  And whenever possible/practical, Dad can ""encourage"" this situation by allowing Mom and the son to spend time together where Dad is not also there monitoring the situation--i.e. pick a situation where the child is likely to misbehave and then make sure that Mom and the child are together without the Dad.  Maybe it is taking a bath--Dad can be in the other room, doing something else, and explain to Mom that he won't help her ""discipline"" the child unless it is a matter of safety.  The wife is putting the husband in a situation of her choosing, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the husband has to embrace that role. Not that this is a simple task--thus the suggestion to see a therapist to help the couple work through these issues.    "
Why would you lie to your children about Santa?,"Aren't the negative things it brings (telling them the truth eventually) worse than the good things? No.  Children experience the world differently than adults, due to their incomplete knowledge.  It may, in fact, be harder for some children to understand that my daily departure from home for many hours is what keeps a roof over their head.  There's no need to make something up until they're older, but on the other hand it brings them a sense of joy and wonder to believe in a fairy tale, if only for a short few years. As they gain understanding they learn new things that contradict their old world views.  This doesn't harm them.  I knew someone who didn't realize until they were an adult that when they were told that chirping street crossing indicators were for the blind, they assumed blind drivers as a child, and didn't re-examine that until much older. It didn't harm them to have an incorrect belief, and in the meantime they were thinking, ""Wow, disabilities really don't hold you back from anything!"" You still can give them presents at this certain date without them thinking it's Santa, right? Of course. You can give presents at any time of the year without explanation.  If the explanation or reasoning has meaning to your or them, then perhaps you can explain it.  There's no need to, though. How much effect does it have on children when they find out you've been lying to them about Santa for years? You really seem concerned about the lie.  Perhaps you've been told or believe that to lie will irreparably damage your relationship with a person or your child. While this is true in general, as children learn and grow they eventually separate fantasy and myth from reality. Dr. Benjamin Siegel, Professor of Pediatrics and Psychiatry at the Boston University School of Medicine is quoted here: What parents should assess is the values they are trying to impart and whether this myth encourages those morals. “Every culture has a fairy tale or myth that belongs to its historical identity,” Siegel says. “If the myths are good and talk about sharing and helping your neighbor, then that’s really nice.” So as you approach a myth you want to present as reality to your children you should be asking yourself what it teaches your child.  What values are you trying to promote? Does the myth help or hinder that? Further in the same article: Parents worry that they will have to break the news to their children and shatter their whole vision of Christmas. However, many children come to this realization on their own around age seven or eight, Siegel says. And when they do, they are basically unscathed. Siegel cites a study that revealed that children who learned the truth may have been upset, but not nearly as upset as the parents. “Most kids do fine when they learn a myth is not real,” he says. “Sometimes parents feel very badly because they want their kids to continue to believe in Santa Claus. Maybe parents like the myth because it makes them feel good, or because kids get disappointed in them when they find out the truth. Kids realize that parents aren’t so powerful, but that happens in adolescence anyway.” And from my personal experience* my children who have gone through this transition are perfectly fine, and trust me as much as I'd expect them to, given their developmental stage.  They clearly understand the difference between myth and reality, and they continue to participate in the myth for a variety of reasons despite their disbelief. What would the negative effects be if you never tell them Santa exists? I have a friend whose parents did not present santa clause to them at all - they had to learn the story through movies and friends.  As an adult they feel like they missed out - and as a result her children get perhaps an over-santa Christmas. They never had a time when they felt that believing joy, and they feel as though they lost out on a small part of childhood as experienced by most children in the US. So on the cultural side of things, Santa as a shared myth is a connecting influence rather than a disconnecting influence.  In a very interesting article by Dwight Longnecker we read, ""...in an increasingly global society, myth is a universal language. "" The article goes on to show that shared myths connect people to society and learn societal truths in ways that cannot easily be done through simple rational thought. Of course, you can share the santa myth as a myth from the beginning, but they will never experience that myth. That might be right for you and your family, but I'd hesitate to use such absolute language and universally discourage every parent from allowing their children to experience the myth rather than simply learn of it. Of course there is the risk that your kid will tell other kids that do believe in Santa about it, but I think this could be easily handled. Could it? A lot of this depends on how you present it, and your child's temperament.  If they already have a great deal of empathy, and you explain well that other children like to or are taught to believe that it's real, your child may show some restraint in offering corrections to other children. It can be hard for some children, particularly those who value truth above all else and have a strong sense of justice, to allow others to believe in something they themselves don't believe in.  It can be hard for even adults to do this, so we can hardly place the blame on children. I don't think it can be easily handled.  However, I do believe you can defend yourself with the simple fact that the truth is on your side, and thus you might not suffer any ill effects.  Unfortunately that might not be true for other children or their families. I don't think there's any way you can spare them without strictly instructing your child that they are not allowed to spoil the other children's fun - and then hoping that they follow those instructions. The more involved you are in the santa myth, though, the more easily your child will avoid these issues entirely.  Reminding them every other day when they talk about santa that santa isn't real will prevent them from pretending.  When they talk about Dora you don't continually remind them that dora isn't real - they already know.  So you needn't offer corrections.  You can leave out cookies and milk, or give them a present ""from"" santa and they will see that pretending is ok - and thus they might give others the choice and chance to pretend without constant correction and possible arguments. Now, on to the good stuff.  You never asked if playing santa has had any particularly good effects.  It has, in fact. Our children are more skeptical, and try to work things out for themselves a little more rather than blindly trusting an authority figure. I can tell my children that they shouldn't blindly trust authority figures, but what I discovered is that if I didn't model the behavior of society to some degree, no matter what I told them they would believe me.  And when I told them to trust someone else, they would blindly follow that person.  This has a lot of risks in life.  Sure, they would eventually figure things out on their own, but santa gives a relatively safe space for them to explore what truth is, how to discover false stories, and, most importantly, to seek out the truth even in the face of a supposed authority. Yes, I want my children to trust me, but I also want them to understand that there are absolute truths, half truths, and myths or lies.  Discerning the difference will be important for them as youth and adults. And if I falter as a parent, they have the skills and ability to chalk it up to me being human, and discovering the truth themselves. There are certainly other ways to do this, but the santa myth accomplishes several things with little to no disappointment or harm. of course there are ways to present it that will ultimately damage your relationship.  But if done thoughtfully, and with an air of fantasy, it can actually strengthen you relationship, and give your children skills they will need as adolescents and adults, and, helpfully, they'll have it by the time they reach the mental stage where it will most be needed. * I have 8 children, 3 of which know the truth, one of which probably knows but hasn't let on, and the other four are still experiencing the myth as though true.  Our only rule is that once you stop believing in santa, you no longer get gifts from him - they still receive what they would in either case, but none come from santa.  This has presented a new challenge to the older crew - and so far they've chosen to continue the pretense.  We've involved them more in the behind the scenes activities as well.  But, honestly, we don't really get into it.  We might leave cookies out once every few years, and presents from santa are typically smaller toys, they get the good stuff (and clothes) from us. There was no big reveal, crying, or evident disappointment. As they grew and experienced others' beliefs they came to their own conclusion, and when pressed for an answer, we would simply state the rule. ""I'm not going to tell you what to believe, you'll have to decide for yourself based on the best evidence you have.  However, I should let you know that 'santa' gives gifts to those who at least appear to believe - so the fun isn't ruined for the younger children."""
How to respond to 17 year old daughter going out with a 25 year old man?,"I was 19 and ran off with a 27 year old woman from America. (I'm British and she is American). My mother disowned me and we didn't speak for a year.  My relationship with my wife lasted 16 years and produced 3 lovely children. So I could never say 'it was a mistake'.  But. I was reckless and foolish and as an adult 20 years later I can easily recognize this.  However, as MY children reach their teenage years I of course see everything from the perspective as a parent.  I think the most important thing to do is not push your daughter away with any shouting matches or 'you are doing the wrong thing' this is what my mother did and although she was doing her best in a difficult situation - the shouting and threats simply pushed me away further.  The new found love that your daughter has found is fantastically powerful and she is overwhelmed with feelings in so much that nothing else truly matters. It's like a drug and despite parents, friends, or even common sense whispering behind the scenes 'don't do this'. She continues because the feelings she has are too strong.  You have every right to express your concerns. But I would be careful in how you deliver your feelings. Recognize the powerful grip the 25 yr old has and that is normal. She is 'in lust mode' and everything is rosy.  I would try and create a containment bubble around a situation you have limited control over but in reality you do have a way to contain the situation.  For instance: So don't panic. These are good things. Outline your concerns but let your daughter know you love and support her and that it is only natural for you to be worried. Reinforce her education about the risks of getting pregnant and maybe set some soft rules like 'education comes first' Maybe she is in sixth form. I don't know.  It could be that the relationship is successful but if something goes wrong be sure she knows you are there for her if things collapse.  I get myself sick with worry in regards to my kids. But at the end of the day, I know at least they are healthy and safe.  You sound like a great parent and I wish the very best to you and your daughter. "
Why don't children know why they do things?,"""I don't know why"" could mean a number of things:  The answer is something that will make my parent annoyed if I'm honest. It's not an outright lie to say ""I don't know"", but it's a dodge to avoid lying or having to instead confess to something worse. Like, ""I didn't pick up my laundry when you asked me to because I was eating a donut after you said not to, and I couldn't come out of the kitchen with donut all over my face or you would know I ate it."" This tends to be the least likely option, though, and also tends to be accompanied by guilty looks and/or other evidence of breaking the rules (e.g., fewer donuts in the box). It could also be that he doesn't want to say ""I didn't want to do what you asked, so I ignored it."" (Would you react warmly and cheerfully to that, even as honest as it is? I wouldn't.) Even without a punishment attached, kids don't really want disapproval and disappointment, either. I don't remember what I was thinking when I decided to disregard instructions,
  or I don't remember being asked to do something. In this case, he could say ""I forgot what you asked me to do"" but may be looking for a reason for why he forgot -- and the ""why"" of memory and attention is a complicated question! My ten-year-old with ADHD has absolutely no idea why he has a harder time concentrating on instructions than most people. This frustrates him and frustrates me, so we both work on not looking for the ""why"" in those cases. (This doesn't imply your child has ADHD, neurotypical children also have moments where they're not paying attention. However, they won't have any better idea of why they weren't paying attention.) I don't have a way to communicate the complex emotions behind my decision. If I'm angry about something at work, I'm more prone to forget to run an errand on the way home that I need to get done. The distraction of all the other things in my life got in the way of doing what needed to get done. But if somebody asks me why I didn't buy bread from the store, I would be hard pressed to explain the sequence of bad meetings, co-worker rudeness, and random software glitches that led to me being so frazzled. At best, I'd be able to say, ""Ugh, I just had a bad day."" I don't want to talk about it. This is a bit more common with older children, especially once you're hitting adolescence, but happens at pretty much any age. If they don't want to discuss what is going on in their head, this keeps that discussion from even starting. And the root cause of that could be any combination of the previous reasons, or wanting privacy, or feeling ashamed of themselves, or just not wanting to talk. (My kids know that any discussion about their motivations will lead to a discussion about making better choices, etc. and that can be boring/exhausting for them...) Or, it's pure honesty: I don't know why I didn't want to do that thing. Motivation is a complex subject, and even adults struggle to get to the root cause of choices they make. Sometimes people make bad choices, and children are still developing both impulse control and introspection."
Should I allow or forbid my son to visit the education of a religion that I do not share?,"I think the key question to ask is, Is your son capable of not believing what he's told in his Religion class? If he's capable of disbelieving it, then he's not being brainwashed, and there's no great crisis. You would do well to discuss with him that the facts in religion are less settled than they are in most of the subjects he's learning at that age. The fact that there are different Religion classes, and that the pupils are taught different and perhaps contradictory things in them, might help him to this realisation! However, those you list all have monotheism in common, so you can't contrast with Religion classes that are polytheistic, nor an Atheism class, nor a Deism-Rejecting-Organised-Religion class. Therefore it's important to expose him to the existence of faiths other than those catered to by his school. Take the example at hand: ""during Roman times people understood that the other gods do not exist, but that only God does"". This is true, in the sense that it describes the conversion to Christianity of the Roman Empire that you've previously discussed with your son. People did come to understand that, but the fact people came to understand something 1700 years ago isn't to say it's true. Catholics, including his teacher, do believe it is true of course. Explain that Catholic class is there to tell him what Catholics believe. However, not everyone believes it, and you're one of the ones that doesn't. Hindus don't believe it either, or Daoists, or Shintoists, or neo-Pagans. It shouldn't be beyond him to understand that his teacher is presenting one view. If he's incapable of disbelieving it, because he in effect believes that schoolteachers are always right about everything, then you have quite a good reason to opt out until he's more mature. You're (in effect) in the same position as people who home-school because they don't want their children to be taught that the planet is more than 6500 years old, except that the class is optional precisely because the school accepts there's no need to teach children the things taught in the Religion class. You're being offered the opportunity to pick and choose. If it weren't for the fact he's already in the class, then since you're non-religious yourself I'd recommend to keep him out of any class that teaches one particular religion as truth. I don't know the German school system, when he's older will there be classes that teach the principal beliefs of multiple religions ""from the outside"", not as truth? As against that, he's been doing this for six months and he enjoys it and his friends all go. So forbidding him to do it might do more harm than the Catholic teacher is doing. I'd guess he's not yet at an age where he'll believe something simply because his parents believe the opposite, but you have to consider in that light what happens if you forbid something that he wants to do, and refuse him access to information he wants to have, that his school and his society in general don't hold to be harmful."
"How to teach children Santa is not real, while respecting other kids beliefs?","The approach we use, with our children, is to focus on understanding the reasons for belief, and the benefits of believing in something even if it's not real.   Our oldest never really believed, and I didn't want to push a belief with falsehoods; by 4 he'd figured things out, particularly at his Montessori preschool with older children having intelligent conversations on the matter.  So when the discussion came up with his friend group, we told him about the history of Santa Claus, and used it as a good time to discuss why people believe in things - whether Santa Claus, religions, myths, or other things that either they know not to be true (in the case of Santa) or don't know definitively to be true (in the case of religion).   We talked about how it's important for some people to believe in things greater than what they can see, for various reasons - either because they're unhappy and need that belief to have a reason for hope, or because it ties a group together culturally, or because it helps people understand things that are important even if they don't understand ""why"".   To me Santa is a great template to discuss religion with, for the non-religious (or for those who may be religious but want to discuss religion in a broader sense).  It's not exactly the same, of course, but a lot of the philosophy underpinning each are similar, especially when distilled to an (intelligent) five-year-old's level.   We also talked about respecting others' beliefs and not challenging them, whether we agree with them or not, simply because it is not polite or nice, and not productive to do so (with beliefs that don't affect us, anyway).  This also has other applications - even something as simple as not telling people that you don't like their hairstyle or clothing, for example, as nothing good comes of it, it doesn't make a difference to you, and it will be hurtful to the person you say it to.  A longer version of ""if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all,"" basically.  We pointed out that mentioning ""Santa is not real"" would make other kids feel bad, and that seemed to work - at least, no parents complained otherwise, and the teachers didn't have to send a note home. Edit: Here are some resources that I find particularly helpful. From psychology central, a reminder that different ages will have different levels of social abilities to process and use this information socially. Consider the age and stage of your child. A 10-year-old who still believes unequivocally that there is a real Santa will be at a clear disadvantage on the playground where most of the other kids don’t. A 4-year-old who insists there isn’t a Santa may well become the focus of sandbox hostility (and you the recipient of phone calls from their very annoyed parents). For 3 to 6 year olds, the world of imagination, including Santa’s North Pole, is an important place to visit. For older children, reconciling story and reality is part of growing up. There’s no definite age for the transition. It’s up to us to know our children well enough to sense where they are on that continuum. This Lifehacker post which mirrors what a friend of mine told me she did just this morning (unrelated to this post!) - make them a santa!  This works particularly well for older siblings, as they are then ""in on the secret"" and will help work with younger siblings (though I understand in your specific case, OP, this isn't desirable, it's highly applicable to others I think). One suggestion that has made the holiday internet rounds in recent years takes it a step further: Get your kids in on the action, too. That’s what one person suggested in this viral Facebook post, which appears to have been originally written by Leslie Rush: Now that you’re old enough, you can become a Santa. From this HappyFamily post, the reminder that Santa is basically a game - and a fun one to play - and telling your kids that is a good way to bridge the gap. The fun of Santa is playing the “Santa game”: writing a letter to Santa, leaving out cookies and milk, having the gifts appear magically overnight! You can still play the “Santa game” (I did and I still do!) and have all the magic of Christmas without lying to your kids. Kids can handle the duality of knowing that Santa is/isn’t real all at the same time. They will still believe in magic! You won’t be taking anything away from them."
Grandparents want our three year old daughter to throw tantrums like her cousin did,"What a pickle you're in! I find it hard to imagine an adult who demands proof of love from a 3 year old by her being distressed (begging and crying). But there you have it. Your parents delight in your daughter's distress at seeing them go. Is that loving or is it immature, both, or something else? You decide. I don't want to tell her that its her cousin's and his parent's behaviour which was wrong until I absolutely have to. I don't want her to ""learn"" separation anxiety, nor get her way with her grandparents by crying. I would suggest that you don't need to bring her cousin or their parents into this if you think they were wrong and the cause of this behavior.  Her cousin was perhaps not well-mannered, but he wasn't ""wrong"". People feel what they feel. You can discuss how different people handle disappointment in different ways including (but not limited to) crying, being angry, shutting down, pouting, accepting it gracefully, being sad, or combinations of these things. You have a different child, and she is not wrong, either, in the way she handles her feelings. You have taught her to be thoughtful of people and to understand that people have to do things like leave at a certain time, and you're proud of her ability to handle her disappointment the way she does at these times. Tell her it's ok to act the way she does, and it's not ok for her grandparents to suggest she be more like somebody else. She is who she is, and she's a good girl who you love to bits and pieces. Then I think you should ask your parents why they delight in seeing your daughter so distraught. I don't know what kind of relationship you have with your parents, but if you can talk to them, go there. They started it; they should have a role in ending it as well. They need to assure her that they know she loves them and doesn't need to prove it by crying and begging them to stay.  If you can't go there with them, the next time they are about to leave, they need to leave regardless of their granddaughter's display. Tell them that you don't want your daughter to beg and cry to get her way, that you're convinced it's better for her to accept that she can't get things by resorting to that behavior. Tell them that that's not going to be charming when she's a teenager and you want to handle it properly now, not later. Then support your daughter, because she is going to be confused. Tell her that if she can go back to just accepting that things are not always going to be the way she wants them to be, she will be happier. If she brings up what they said, tell her they were wrong to compare her to someone else. It might be awkward, but it's true. And sometimes people are wrong, just like you and everybody else in the whole world. (BTW, how is the cousin now? If he's better, you might ask your parents if they feel less loved now that he doesn't have a meltdown every time they leave. If they don't, then apply that to your daughter's love. Also, tell your daughter that he's grown out of that behavior, but he still loves his extended family.) If you can throw in an example of when you were wrong, and when your partner was wrong, and how you finally realized you were wrong, that's helpful."
What do I do about my mom setting her expectations too high?,"You have lots of options. Here's one: At dinner one evening, you can say you have a serious announcement. Then tell your mom and dad that you're pregnant. You're really sorry you slipped up, but it will all be OK, not to worry, because you're in love and you plan to marry the father. Unfortunately, you can't bring the father over to meet them because he's wearing an ankle monitor and can't leave his house for a few more months. After the screaming and the tears die down, let them know it's all a fabrication, but that is what some girls' lives are really like, and that's a real cause for disappointment, not a 91 on a Spanish test in a class in which you're getting an A, or a lot of other things your mom is disappointed about. This would take a lot of courage and fortitude to withstand the aftermath, but it might get your point across. Or, you can go to your school counselor and start meeting weekly with them to discuss the situation at home. What your mom is doing is unhealthy in a lot of ways, especially for you. When your counselor feels they have a good grip on the situation, they can meet with your parents. Another option is to appeal to your dad - who seems to understand that your mom has unrealistic expectations - to start family therapy. A specialist might be needed here to get to the root(s) of the problem and effect some change. You can try to have some very adult and honest conversations with your mom. Ask her what her childhood and teens were like, what she's happiest about and what her biggest regrets are. That might get her to thinking about how she's trying to work through her own past (just a guess) by controlling your life. You seem to know this is your mom's problem, and what you're suffering is its side effects, so that's great for you. The point is, it is a problem, and it's not really about you. Your mom needs help, and likely it will involve a professional, as she most likely will not/cannot give due weight/consideration to anything you say to her in an attempt to get her to change. Of course, you can just recognize this is not really about you and suffer her comments, but this will get worse - a lot worse - before it gets better, because your teens involve distancing yourself from your parents (expressing differing opinions from theirs) in anticipation of healthy independence, and if she doesn't change, the ""disappointment"" will get worse. So I wouldn't recommend this as an option. It's a difficult situation and I hope you find a solution that effects a positive change."
At what age should I tell my daughter that her real mother is dead?,"Children are resilient, and are usually far more capable of dealing with the idea of death than we give them credit for. There are two things I would avoid: and Your current wife is your daughter's mom.  Period.  But so was your first wife.  Personally, I would take the approach of telling your daughter that she's got two moms.  The one that she knows, and the one that died when she was a baby.   How many details, if any, that you provide beyond that depend on what questions your daughter asks, although I agree on the advice on being careful of telling her that your first wife died during childbirth.   If that does come up in her questions, you can be vague (e.g. ""she became ill when she was pregnant"") without being deliberately evasive. It is, in my opinion, better to tell her now for two reasons.  One reason is that the earlier you tell her, the more commonplace it will seem to her.  If she's ""always"" (children remember very little, if anything, of episodic details from before they are 4 or 5) known that she had 2 mothers, and that one died when she was a baby, that will simply be a fact of how things are, rather than an unusual or potentially disturbing detail. The other reason is that the longer you delay, the more she might question why you waited so long to tell her something so important."
Being told I'm father to a son I don't want,"Judging from your ""Jeremy Kyle show"" reference as well as your use of certain phrases, I assume that you are in the U.K., which has some impact on which answer is right as far as legal matters are concerned. I am not a lawyer and I don't live in the U.K., so take this with a grain of salt. You mention that social keeps ""ringing me for a DNA test because he needs a name on the birth certificate."" The U.K. government attempted to pass a law requiring fathers to be named on birth certificates, but it seems that they abandoned said attempt according to the article. Not much else shows up about U.K. fathers and birth certificates/legal requirements, but that's just a routine Google search.  However, there is likely some pressure on ""social"" to get you to sign, especially since the U.K. government was trying for some time to get the names of fathers put on birth certificates. I would imagine, given that there may not be a law requiring you to do anything immediately, that it is possible that you can do nothing and the problem will go away (for now, and assuming an adoption takes place), but I am not familiar in the ways of U.K. bureaucracy. Talking to social without representation could lead to very bad things for you personally. As other people have answered here, get a lawyer if you don't want the child, and get a lawyer if you do want the child. Can't afford a lawyer? Yes you can. You can afford a lawyer way more than you can afford not getting a lawyer. Figure it out. Tell your family and then get the money to afford it. Borrow it. Panhandle for it. Get a lawyer. If you refuse to take this advice... do nothing and see what happens. And by do nothing I mean do NOT answer the phone when ""social"" is calling. I have been here, in this exact situation (22 not 21), and my first thought was for the child.  Now he's 12 and we have a great relationship and I couldn't imagine life without him. I was with the mother for far too long (do NOT re-enter a relationship with the mother) and it was unhealthy all around. But my relationship with my son? Priceless. Why did this relationship turn out so well? My first thought was for the child. Seeing as you put this question up without a single word of concern or care about what is possibly your child being out in the world without biological parents, I would assume that you believe that he will be taken care of if given up for adoption and you aren't worried about his well-being. This is probably relatively natural for a lot of guys. If your first thought is for yourself, so be it. Do not become a single father if you can help it. I was just thinking last night that telling my mother about pretty much this exact situation was the hardest most embarrassing thing I've ever gone through. Since then I've gone through hard, embarrassing things, and most didn't measure up. It made me stronger, and I don't think my mother lost too much respect for me seeing as a parent's respect for their child is mostly worn away during the average 8149 diaper changes it takes to get a baby through potty training. ""I feel as though if I'll become a lonely poor exhausted stressed person who just goes through life day to day with no real purpose no friends."" That's life as a single parent for the first 3-6 months. You can make it much longer than that living exhausted and stressed without a purpose or friends. Is it worth it to you? What values as far as parenthood do you hold dear? Can you go through life wondering how it could have been but glad to be rid of the responsibility? A lot of people can, and that's fine, that's life, that's humans. But in the end, you are the one who has to answer this question."
How to convince a 4-year old child that professional cyclists are not littering during a race?,"So... I've raced bikes and from my experience, they are probably littering.  As much as a race organizer may try to clean up after a race the distance covered and volume of waste generated during a race means trash is spread along hundreds of miles and clean up is not going to be 100% effective.  Those racers are probably also practicing sanctioned littering. My recommendation of what to tell your son would be to explain that what they are doing is wrong.  It shouldn't happen - regardless of the reasoned nuances that we can come up with.   How I would frame it would be that you, his father desires for him to be better in every way than those racers.  You want him to be faster, stronger and smarter, but you also want him to be kinder, more thoughtful and responsible than what is depicted on screen.  That means that he rides, trains and studies hard but also picks up after himself, and doesn't leave trash out on the road. EDIT Thanks to @doppelgreener for the insight that expanded my own perspective.  I realise that I may be presumptive with my suggestion that you desire specific qualities in your son when saying: You want him to be faster, stronger and smarter... The intention is not to say you want those things, but to recognize that there are qualities about the professional cyclists on the TV screen that a 4 year old boy finds admirable and desires to mimic.  My thought is to not encourage a negative view of those positive traits but to encourage a more complete picture of desirable character not necessarily demonstrated on screen.  Just like an actor.   I'm leaving the original phrasing for context and answer continuity. EDIT 2 I made an unsupported claim that World-Class Athletes are probably littering.  Rightfully challenged by @BSO Rider.  There are no publicly available scientific studies, but there is a precedent for my claim.  Feel free to read the following: It's true that I haven't ridden professionally, but if environmental rules aren't being followed by a group of weekend warriors where the stakes are a beer and a high-five, you can bet that it's not being followed by professionals whose lives depend on results."
What are some strategies for raising a bilingual child?,"I grew up bilingual, and so does my son of 18 months. My son and I both have a Danish father and an Austrian mother. Here is what I've learned, from my own life as child and as parent, and from others: Start immediately. it won't do to decide on this after a year or more. It must be from the start, because kids learn even before birth, and most under the age of 10 months. They need to learn the ""melody"" and the sounds of the language, and that only works well early on.  You must be native speaker, or equal to it. I've seen Austrian homes where one parent speaks poor English in an attempt to teach the language. Doesn't work. It's not enough to teach individual words from picture books. It's not enough to speak what you learned in school. You've got to know all the words you're ever going to need, and you only know that if you're a native or if you are immensely good at English as a foreign language. Don't even get me started on pronunciation and grammar!  Be consistent. I speak Danish to my son 99% of the time. I'd say any less than 90% and it doesn't catch on well. I do speak German with him if he's around other kids/people if I need them to understand too. But I also speak Danish to other small kids, mostly for fun but also to show that it's not a secret language.  Show, don't tell. I speak Danish to my wife 80% of the time. There are things that I can tell her easier in German, but mostly my son hears me talk this language with others too. It's not just for him. My side of the family also speaks Danish, wife's side German. Luckily we all understand each other.  Act natural. Speaking any language is normal. Don't act special when speaking any particulate language. There should be no difference in the way you act, in relation to what language you speak. They're both just a language.  Books and stuff. This is actually the difficult part! It can be hard to find enough material/books/toys in the current country's foreign language. In my case, we're surrounded by German stuff but it's an effort to ensure enough Danish material to keep the balance. In particular, media goes here -- television, DVDs, computer stuff. Plan ahead, is the best advice I can give for this point.  English is third. In our case, we're not in an English-language country. Third (and fourth, etc.) languages come easier to the child if the two primary languages are firmly in place first, so don't worry about thirds in the beginning, except if you are in an English-language country, in which case it should be mixed in naturally.  That's it from the top of my head. I might edit and add more later. "
My 16 year old daughter got a speeding ticket,"I drive fast...too fast...and am working on breaking that habit now. Both parents drove fast and aggressive and therefore I picked up those traits, still I am the one driving and choosing to drive in that manner. What has really helped me remember not to speed is the reason we have speed limits and other driving laws. Why is there a speed limit and why was it set at 20 MPH?  Have a frank discussion with your daughter to encourage her to think about the why. A 20 MPH area is more than likely a residential or school area.  Reason #1 you do not speed in these areas, children and pets may be running around playing and may unexpectedly end up in the street.  Ask your daughter, ""At 46 MPH do you think you could see and react to a child running into the street chasing after a ball?"" Guarantee Hopefully her answer is ""No."" Then ask her what would happen if she hit this kid? Does she understand it is considered manslaughter if they die? Or how would she feel if she hit a family's dog? (Of course, you may want to be more gentle in this discussion, you don't want to scare her away from driving, just teach her it comes with serious responsibility). For new drivers, understanding why rules and laws are in place will have a better effect than just saying ""drive by the rules of the road"".  I also strongly suggest courses which teach young drivers about their cars, how accidents happen, how to steer out of a skid, etc."
Is having a sibling better for a child?,"A large part of the population can be counted on to tell you why you should do exactly what they did, and all the downsides to whatever you're doing that they didn't do. You might even have tendencies to do this yourself. And so on. Do not look for factual rebuttals to these claims. All important decisions have plusses and minuses. Your friends are not wrong when they mention some of the minuses of having ""only"" one child. But the existence of these minuses doesn't mean you're wrong to stop at one. If you go on to have another child later, it doesn't mean these friends can be delighted that they ""won the argument."" If you can, just laugh these comments off and say ""when and if we're expecting another, we'll be sure to tell you!"" If you can't laugh, and wish they could stop, put a serious face on and say ""things aren't always that simple, and I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't campaign for something I can't choose right now."" Then don't go into details about the ""can't"". They may conclude you're infertile, but at least they'll stop teasing you. If you really want advice, surely you know that"
My 2.5 years old daughter asks to learn to read,There are lots of things you can do:
Lying to my daughter about her mother's death,"As far as working on a eliciting a reaction goes, if she seems to be coping ok and there aren't any other behavior / mood changes to indicate problems, I wouldn't worry about it.  Everyone handles grief and mourning differently, both in the how and the when.  She may have handled it on her own in private sometime.  She just may not need a full blown crying session to get through it.  As long as she seems fine and she knows and trusts you enough to come to you for help if needed, don't worry. If you still find yourself worrying or you see signs that things aren't ok, you could always consider some sort of therapist.  Their job is to help people with this kind of stuff.  They should be excellent resources for you. As far as when you should tell your daughter, I would do it sooner than later, immediately if possible.  There are a few reasons for this. Being honest will strengthen your relationship.  Based on your comments, it sounds like this lie about the circumstances of her mother's death was probably conceived with good intentions.  However, lying never leads to good things, especially in the long run.  And even if you didn't start the lie, not telling the truth makes you complicit.  Dishonesty isn't just acts of commission (like lying), but also acts of omission, like not disclosing the truth and letting a lie continue.  Relationships are fundamentally founded in trust and trust can only come with honesty. Picture yourself telling your daughter the truth in say 5 years.  She will be a teenager.  She will have hormones, puberty, social drama, etc - all the teenager things.  And then you are going to try and heap the revelation that her mother committed suicide on top of all that?  I can't imagine that going well.  It will open up old wounds relating to her mother's death as she has to, again, grieve and now come to terms with the fact that she committed suicide.  Your daughter's head will be spinning.  Why did she kill herself?  Did she not love me?  What drove her to that?  Why? On top of that I can easily see her start to wonder about you.  Why didn't Dad tell me this before?  Is this some kind of cruel joke?  If it isn't a joke, why now?  What else am I not being told?  What else is Dad/my other family members hiding from me?  This can all easily break her trust in you.  Since this lie involves both her parents and her mother's death, it will be a very personal and sensitive topic.  A lie about something that personal will cause loads of emotional damage.  And it will be hard to repair. If you tell her now it will still hurt.  It will always hurt, no matter when you want to tell her.  But now the damage will be far less.  She will have you and the rest of her family to help her grieve.  You will all be there to talk with her and support her.  And you will all be sharing that experience, which will draw you closer.  And when it's all over, she (and you) can all get some closure and then put it away for good.  No need to bring it up later and have to go through it all again. The short version is that there is no way to deal with a parent's death, especially by suicide, that won't cause pain.  This is more about damage control rather than complete avoidance.  The longer you wait, the bigger the lie gets and the more harm it causes when compounded with dealing with the suicide.  Grieve together and work through it together.  Don't save it for later, it'll just fester and rot your relationship."
Four year old started calling me by my first name. Is this problematic?,"There's a difference between why a child does/should/should not address their parent(s) by their first name, and how to explain it to a child. The why is important when discussing the ""why not"" to the child. An older child might do so because of emotional distance from their parent, because of egalitarian reasons, or both. Family culture is also important. A child of 4 is probably doing it for one of several reasons: it annoys you or otherwise causes a reaction of some kind on you, it amuses her, it gives her a feeling of empowerment, she's copying someone else (does your wife call you by your first name?), or she does it to emphasize she is speaking to you (kind of like you'd use her whole name to get her full attention.) But at that age. it's usually not done for reasons of emotional distance. The traditional parent will give the reason that ""Daddy"" is an honorific. It's analogous to calling a teacher ""Ms. Smith"", not ""Zelda"", or the doctor, ""Doctor [X]"", not Pat. This may strike liberal parents as outdated or authoritarian. Another reason to call a person ""Daddy"" or ""Dad"" is based on intimacy. It signals that you are more closely related biologically but also emotionally to her than Brian, the next door neighbor. In this context, it denotes love (not only respect), analogous to you calling her ""sweet pea"" (or ""possum blossom""*, or whatever your favorite pet name for her is), but calling the child next door by less intimate names (her given name or ""sweetie""/whatever generic (which also includes a power dynamic, btw.) How you approach asking her to use the preferred designation should have something to do with why she does it and why you object. You might want to ask her why she does it to you, but calls her mother Mom/Mommy. If it really doesn't bother you, but you want her to go with Daddy because you don't want a long, drawn out scene with bystanders and the police when she throws a tantrum, talk to her about that possibility. Tell her that it's important that strangers know how the two of you are related so that people might not make mistaken assumptions that can cause trouble.  If it makes you feel less intimate with her, explain that as well. It's good for a child to know fathers need love, too. :) Ask her if she would like it if you stopped calling her ""sweet pea""/whatever. If she doesn't want you to stop because ""sweet pea"" makes her feel special, say ""daddy"" makes you feel special to her. *My first born started out with ""sweet pea"" in utero, which morphed into ""peasome"" (who knows why, maybe because he was a male), and because language works this way, it morphed to ""peasome possum"", and because he was beloved and language works this way, he ended up with the bizarre pet name, ""Possum Blossom"", which is maybe worse than ""Sweet Pea""."
Impact on kids NOT having TV?,"For a different perspective: When I was in grade school, I had a friend that didn't have any type of TV service at home (they did have dial-up internet, but certainly no Netflix). I was completely unaware of this fact for a long time, until the first time I went to his house. There was a TV in the living room, but it was only used to watch home videos, and later on, for video games*. I, being a ""raised by the TV"" child, was initially incredulous, but his two-minute explanation made me not only completely accept it, but seriously reconsider my own TV habits (mind you, I was about 12 years old at the time). While I can't remember the excellent case he stated, I offer my current viewpoint, which is still almost entirely based on the conversation from that one day (supplemented by subsequent experience that I cannot segregate, as I do not recall all of the original details).
*Also, he was only allowed to have ""family-friendly"" video games. His family was fairly well-off, at least as far as families of public-school kids go. Certainly, this primarily owed to his parents' jobs, but he told me that they credited a degree of their professional success to the types of lifestyle choices they made, including that of not watching TV. This is one element that I know has been reinforced by other life experiences. I've had opportunities to interact with a number of upper-middle-class people, and a few ""crazy-rich"" folks, and a recurring theme is that watching TV takes too much time away from the things one needs to do to improve one's life situation.   Watching TV is mind-dulling. As specific examples, reading books and playing video games both stimulate the mind more than TV. The reason is, in both of the latter instances, you're a participant in the activity. With video games I never get argument on that point - there's an obvious input/output interaction - but I have been asked how I can say the same about books - ""You can't influence what happens in a book!"" True, but if we stop paying attention to the TV (perhaps something distracts us for a moment), the story continues along without us, unless we take the time and effort to pause (and rewind a bit to catch what we missed between the distraction and our reaction time) - which we typically won't do, especially for minor and/or repetitive distractions; most times, we either ignore or accept the distraction. In such cases we are allowing the story to run on its own. Whereas with a book, any distraction (that is not ignored) will always ""pause"" the story. Only when we are ready to once again fully engage will it resume; and we'll never start farther down the page, but either at the exact point of interruption or, more often, back a bit to re-sync. Additionally, with a book, we fully control the speed of the story (within the limits of our reading skill), but with TV shows, the speed is dictated by the producer."
Is bribing children with cash incentives a good idea?,"Bribery is a bad thing The problem with bribing them to do things is that it establishes pattern of rewarding good behaviour with money/treats/snacks. As soon as the child is old enough to realize it, they'll refuse to do anything unless it is rewarded somehow. This situation is incredibly hard to break, so it's best not to get there in the first place. Good behaviour should be established as the norm. Yes, all children have difficult days and that is what the naughty-step, no-dessert, removal-of-privileges, bedtime-with-no-stories scale of disincentives is for. When they've had a day of good behaviour, then that's the time to reward them with a small reward to enforce that a whole day of good behaviour gets results. The small reward is: they get to choose what's for breakfast/lunch/dinner, which DVD to watch, where to go at the weekend, etc. Nothing monetary nor snack/treat/toy. The big rewards - trip to the theme park/play center/farm/toyshop - should be kept back for major achievements such as being fully potty-trained, dry at night, first write their name, etc. Now, these rewards aren't offered up-front - they are given as a result of the exceptional behaviour. We use a chart which fills up with stickers to track the steps leading up to a big event (e.g. each dry night of 7) and explain to the children that when they reach the end of the chart, we'll do something nice such as go feed the ducks at the pond, which is different to a normal day. We find that they take to this and are suitably surprised when we 'upgrade' them to a trip to the play centre, etc. UPDATE So our children are now 9 and 6 and we still use the chart. They get several stickers/ticks each day for good effort, good results, exceptional behaviour (good behaviour is the expected norm now), doing something without us asking/nagging, etc. They've responded really well to this - on an average day, they get between 3 and 5 stickers/ticks for good effort on homework, good music practice, tidying their room before we asked, when a parent comments on their kind/good behaviour to others, etc. They also fully understand that we don't disclose what might happen when they complete their chart. Indeed, one time, we just tied some rope to the apple tree to make a swing but this was such fun that they told all their friends. We scale the chart for their age - 7 x age in years; we have higher expectations of the 9 year old and he has more responsibilities than his younger sister at this stage. We have also removed stickers/ticks for when they've done something bad/poor behaviour that needed reinforcing - e.g. getting under mummy's feet causing her to miss the train three days in a row, telling grandma the wrong medicine to give to the 6 year old (she didn't, phew!). We are very clear on the consequences of the bad behaviour and we remove stickers/ticks from the top of the chart so they can see the impact. Every parent thinks highly of their child but we've had feedback from other parents, teachers, scout leaders, camp organisers, etc., that our children understand how their behaviour can influence outcomes and that they make good choices based on this knowledge."
How should I handle a little boy who likes girls' toys?,"There's nothing whatsoever wrong with your son, but there is something very very wrong with his father. The best thing you can do is try to limit your sons exposure to this person. If he has these sorts of attitudes you should be able to argue that he is a danger to your sons emotional well-being and potentially have his level of access limited to only supervised visits."
"How to answer my 5 year old why I can tell her what she has to do, and why she can't tell me what to do","Try to go along this line:  There are rules that exist for everyone. I have to go to work. You have to go to school. I tell you about the rules because I know them; I don't just make them up to bother you. Sometime, I will simplify a rule or regroup a few ""grownup rules"" for you. Because there are other, more complicated, rules that I can't directly explain to you.  Don't forget that sometimes you will be the bad guy.  Yes, you yanked her arm and it hurt and it's not fun and she really wanted to chase her ball. But she didn't rush into the street under a speeding car. Your kid is not your friend. You have responsibility for her health, for her education and for her overall well being. It would not be a normal relationship with a friend. It can change later, but she is 5. Society has rules that individual people could do without, but are needed for the society to function. You have to teach those rules, written or not, to your daughter. You probably do this out of love as much as out of responsibility, so that one day, she might do the same down the line. Going to school is not a choice; it's a rule. And, at 5, she has to learn to follow the rules, before getting to the point where she can judge, overcome or break them."
Should a parent delete a teen's social media account if it was handled badly?,"Ok, deleting wouldn't do anything. Keeping her activities in secret, is a clear sign to me, that she thinks that you will just be unreasonably forbidding her to do anything in that direction. If you now do that, you just prove her right as well as increasing the distance between you two at least in this aspect. Also you won't stop her from recreating accounts in other ways, redoing her mistakes again. Actually even if you somehow manage to keep her away from social media until she is legal and can do as she pleases. What will she have learned from that? If she does stupid things it isn't a solution to just delay it for a few years. You seem to have a good idea about how to behave on the web with private data, so it would be more valuable if she could learn the basic idea from you. At first get rid of the idea of punishing her, show her your disapproval of breaking rules and about lying, if she lied. But also show her that you want to help her. (I know that is difficult.) Because you two need to go together through her accounts and then work through the problems. And you really need to do it together and with her approval (if possible even by her guidance). And accept that you probably won't get into every part of her online life. If you can show her on a few platforms what the problems are, you already have the best chance to get the ideas across."
"Is it bad being a ""bad influence"" for my younger cousin?","I lived in a family which was fairly restrictive.  They were quite religious, we always ate healthy, never any junk food, all our activities were vetted and scrutinized.  It was also emotionally repressive; my father had a very bad temper and would strike us whenever he was angry. When I got out, went to college, got a job (like you, in the IT industry), I vowed I would be an emotional support to my younger siblings.  There were six of them, ranging from 3 years younger than me to 18 years younger. At least once a month, I would invite the ones who were still at home out to a day of role playing games (which my parents did not approve of but didn't object enough to tell the kids they couldn't come).  We had a great time, ate a lot of junk food, and stayed up way too late. Now, twenty five years later, my youngest sister tells me it was like being thrown a life preserver while drowning in freezing, choppy waters.  She also is a programmer, and has a great career, a great marriage and four kids.  I don't think playing games all night seems to have hurt her at all :) I can only speak to you from my own experience; I was suicidal all throughout my early years of college because of emotional abuse, and a large part of that was feeling isolated.  I didn't have a single ally to turn to, and we moved so often I never really got to have friends.  Having a friend who was a relative (as so could not be ""left behind"" when we moved) would have made a huge difference in my life. Your great cousin's mother is right now feeling frustrated and maybe overwhelmed.  It is natural that children should emotionally separate from their parents, and become adults in their thinking and habits.  Some parents (especially mothers) have a difficult time being separated from.  They worry about their children, and when they do things outside of mother's control control it worries her even more.  Maybe you could reassure her a bit by finding some things you could do with your great cousin which his mother would approve of (in addition to the fun stuff) Another factor might be that she does not want to acknowledge the bad influence of her husband, and so she is looking for another cause for bad behaviors in her son.  When people feel angry at a person who is close to them, they sometimes cannot accept that anger, so they turn it on someone else.  I did that...I was so angry at my father that I hated him, but I could not deal with my father being ""the enemy"" so I diverted to myself.  That was why I was suicidal; I hated myself.  So try not to take what she says personally.  It might be that you are receiving anger that is actually for your great cousin's father, and she is saying to you what she wants to say to him but is unable. My final advice would be not to abandon your great cousin.  You might be one of his only life-lines right now during a difficult time.  But don't make an enemy of his mother.  Try, if you can, to reassure her that your influence is good.  But don't do it by trying to convince her that the things she disapproves of are actually good.  Find good things to focus on and tell her about.  I don't know what they might be, as I do not know her, but I'm sure you (and your great cousin) could think of some.  Then tell her that you are concerned by what she has said and that because of it, you are going to (do something approved and positive) with him. (again, in addition to the fun stuff, but focus her attention where you want it to be) This will have multiple effects.  In any good communication, you should give feedback.  You are telling her ""I have understood what you said and I accept it"".  This will make her feel less frustrated and perhaps less angry at you.  And it is the truth, as you have said in your question.  You want to be a good cousin, you are concerned for his welfare.  It will also make her feel as though she has some control over what you do with her son.  Get together with your great cousin and come up with some ""acceptable"" activities, and tell her ""I was thinking we might do this or this; what do you think?"" When you approach a conflict (or potential conflict) with a loved one, I think it is good to do so seemingly from a position of weakness.  When you make yourself weak to them and ask them for help in your ""weakness"" you can turn an enemy into an ally.  You are suggesting to her ""I am worried that I was wrong and you were right, help me to be right"".  You tell your cousin of your worry about being a bad influence, and concern for his relationship with his mother and enlist him as an ally to change that.  Hopefully, that can make the situation better, though don't expect to end all conflict. A side note: the idea of approaching a conflict from weakness only works if the other person cares about you, and it doesn't work with bullies (or in situations of bullying by loved ones.)  Yes, you are in a male dominated profession but that is something to be proud of.  You are a fish who swims upstream instead of down.  Good for you!"
How to talk to a teen daughter about her weight,"Your daughter is 16 years old.  While you're right that she's ""under [y]our roof and so [y]our rules"", that's not going to last forever; presumably she'll be moving out to go to college (or something else) soon.  At this point, your role as a parent is less about setting rules and more about helping her learn things. That's not to say rules don't need to exist, and don't serve a purpose, even at this age; you're there to protect her from making significant or dangerous mistakes.   But she's not a five year old; rules aren't the main thing anymore. She's very capable of learning what and why, and in a few years that's what she'll be using ultimately in the rest of her life.  So whatever you do in this regard should be directed towards helping her learn what and why, and obtaining her buy-in.   First: some perspective.  Your daughter is 25 points over what you call her 'ideal weight'.  That's basically average in the US; in fact, the average US woman at 20+ years old is 5'3.7"", 168.5 lbs. She's not the average sixteen year old; there, she's in the 94th percentile of BMI.  The concern here is that it's harder to move ""down"" than ""up"" the BMI scale; so while she's around average for a woman who's ten or twenty years older, that's because lots of people gain weight and fewer lose it. But she's also at least somewhat athletic, right?  How athletic, exactly, matters.  Muscle is more dense than fat, and BMI does not accurately describe healthiness of athletes for that reason.  Make sure you take that into account, if she actually is fairly athletic, and perhaps talk to her doctor about other ways to tell how healthy she is. Your daughter is on two sports teams; while she's in between seasons, two sports teams is pretty good in my book activity wise.  If she's fairly serious about the teams and practices regularly, then she's getting, overall, a fair amount of physical activity - just not today. The things you're describing - eating junk food, eating multiple helpings, etc. - are all things that are pretty normal for teenagers, also. Not ideal, again, but ""normal"", and almost certainly something all of her friends are doing. What it sounds like to me from this, is that your daughter is reasonably healthy, but has a few bad habits that are leading her to be a bit overweight.  This leads to the 'action items': Focus on habits, not on results.  Frankly, an extra 25 pounds as a 16 year old doesn't matter very much for her long term health.  What matters is that those 25 pounds don't become 50 or 75 when she's 30 or 40.  Losing those 25 pounds right now shouldn't be the goal; instead, fixing the habits is. The American Academy of Pediatrics released a comprehensive paper on childhood obesity, and it doesn't hold back on this guidance.  The first guideline to a pediatrician is to discourage dieting; that guideline continues to say that: The focus should be on healthy living and healthy habits rather than on weight. Be a facilitator. A subsequent guideline in that AAP paper suggests just that, that you should facilitate healthy habits: Do more at home to facilitate healthy eating and physical activity. Instead of trying to force her to eat healthily, facilitate her eating.  This is no different than what I and my wife do for ourselves; we're both terrible snackers who tend to eat anything with a carbohydrate in the house.  Get rid of the unhealthy stuff. I'm not talking about the stuff she buys; just make sure the rest of what's around is only healthy things.   This may well require some sacrifices on your part, by the way. We don't keep ice cream around the house because I don't have the willpower to not eat it; my wife would prefer to have it, but she doesn't because it's bad for me. I don't buy fatty meats for the same reason for her.  Find the things that tempt her, and remove them.   One of the other major things they include, by the way, is focusing on family mealtimes. It's hard to do that, with all of the activity with a majorly active family, but maybe you should make the sacrifice anyway.  Maybe you volunteer on one less thing, and your son does one less activity.  Make it happen.  This is a significant factor; read the studies in the AAP article.  It's important, and it has lasting effects, even after she leaves the house. Focus on education instead of orders.  Teach her why things work.  Why it's important to have good habits at 16.  And help her learn how to do the things needed to change her habits.   Someone I know was very similar to your daughter at 16.  A bit overweight, with perhaps poor habits, and with parents focused on her weight.  But fortunately, she also had a good high school that took health education seriously.  She didn't use those tools for quite a while, but when she did, she was able to lose enough weight to be back in the 'normal' range again. This might mean that you have to do some real research, too.  Not just ""this is the ideal weight"", but learn a lot about the subject.  Learn how people gain and lose weight.  Learn what better habits can be developed.  Learn about different strategies that people use to change their own habits.  Become as close to an expert as you can, and then teach her. Show, don't tell.  Maybe the easiest entré into this conversation is ""Dear, you're right; Mom and I should improve our habits too.  Let's come up with a plan together.""  It's always easier to change habits with someone else also changing theirs. So take that first step.  Maybe you need to offer to go running with her in the mornings/evenings.   Set limits when appropriate, but understand that the best person to set those limits is your daughter. I'm not suggesting she should have unlimited screen time and junk food necessarily; but you'll be far more successful, and far less stressed, if she's the one recognizing the need.  Don't come into this waving the punishment stick.   Consider in her specific case that some of it is related to the timing of her sports schedule.  How about, ""It looks like you're having trouble staying active during the off season.  Would you like to come up with some ways to get more active during the off season?""  Or, focus on eating habits that are appropriate for a highly active athlete, but not for a less active person.  It's okay to have multiple helpings when you're exerting a lot of energy regularly; it's probably not when you're mostly sedentary."
Should I buy my college child a vehicle when I can afford to or make him earn it on his own?,"I like the way my mother did: I told my mother I was going to buy my first car. She listened to me, my budget, my pro's and con's and once I had picked a car I could afford and was planning to get it she figured out I was serious and told me that she had ""a little something extra"" for me. This method meant that I had experienced the pricing of cars, had to evaluate what was possible with my budget, thus having a sense of worth. And after that had happened, I got a bonus allowing me to get some better features. Because I had researched it enough, I also knew the added worth my mother provided me."
My child witnessed a toddler being taught to cuss by older kids. How to deal with rude language at social gatherings?,"All you can do is teach your own child. It is never too early to learn that not everyone believes the same stuff, or even agrees on good behaviour.  Your son will already have learnt those words at school so don't worry to much on that front. I would start with  ""I am glad you weren't joining in with teaching that toddler those
  nasty words, that wasn't funny at all"" It honestly doesn't matter if he was or not at this stage, praise is always good"
Programming with a baby,"What most of the answers imply but don't out and out say which should be made absolutely clear is that if you're the one caring for the child (as opposed to just being in the house at the same time as the child and the other parent/nanny/carer) it's close to impossible in the long term.  Generally the workable situations people talk about assuming another carer in the house with the child at least part time. Make no mistake, children are demanding.   In the early months they sleep a lot but not in a nice predictable way and not in large chunks the way you'd like them to (a baby's sleep cycle is 40 minutes long and while they may sleep more than one cycle at a time you can't count on it).  In the early days they're also feeding every 4 hours - something that will take between 20 minutes and over an hour plus there's changing and so on.  Remember too that this goes on 24 hours a day - you're not getting a nice solid 8 hours a day to recover so don't assume any time the baby is asleep is time you can work, most of it you'll be recovering. As they get older they do sleep for longer and get more predictable but at that point they also start moving around (crawling starts somewhere between 6 and 12 months, walking between, say, 9 and 18 months) and demanding more attention.  At that point they are absolutely full time when they're awake and by this point sleep during the day is maybe 2 hours total (in either one or two blocks). Once they're in bed at night (if you're lucky from about 3 months you'll get 11 hours or so with just one scheduled break for a bottle - though there are likely to be unscheduled breaks in there where you need to go and comfort them) you need to get all the stuff done you didn't during the day - washing, ironing, you've got to eat something yourself and generally run the house.  And you've got to try and sleep because you'll be exhausted. Edit: Incidentally, in the UK, where parents have the right to apply to work from home (and the employer has to grant it if it's reasonable, though reasonable is a very slippery term in this context), a separate working environment and childcare during working hours are an absolute prerequisite."
Teenagers Ogling my Daughter. What to do?,"Should I ask them to stop or let them be? You should probably not involve yourself directly. It's your daughter who has to decide whether she feels uncomfortable, and whether to address that feeling by confronting the boys in question. It won't do her any good if you solve problems for her that she needs to learn to handle herself. What you can do is talk to your daughter. Ask her how the attention of the boys makes her feel. If you think it's inappropriate, discuss this with her. If she asks how to handle it, suggest different avenues of action and discuss them with her. Make sure she knows where to draw the line (which she must define herself - you can't do it for her) and then defends that line when someone crosses it. That requires self-confidence, so anything you do to boost her self-confidence is a step in the right direction (and taking care of problems for her doesn't help to build self-confidence at all). What's more, she probably won't like it if you involve yourself directly, especially if she knows the boys that look at her and doesn't see them as complete jerks. It might be somewhat humiliating for her to have dad act as her protector when it's not necessary in her opinion. I must admit I did ogle at other girls when I was their age Teenage boys and men are wired to find teenage girls beautiful. Here's the other side of the medal: What applies to your daughter would also apply to your teenage son, if you had one. If you saw him looking at girls in a way you thought inappropriate, again, you'd have to discuss it with him.  Looking at beautiful girls is probably something most teenage boys feel compelled to do, but there's some ways to do it that are respectless and demeaning, and others that won't hurt anybody, and you can start teaching that to small children already, when they point at people who fascinate them. You don't have to punish them for finding someone else fascinating, but you should explain to them that there's different ways to express that fascination, some being more acceptable than others."
"Can ""The Giving Tree"" be explained in a way that isn't an unhealthy lesson?","This book works differently for people at different stages of their lives.  The lesson for young children reading this book, I believe, is about unconditional love. Children need to know and trust that their parents will always be there for them, loving them without question, even if they need them their whole lives. You could say to your young child, ""I'm like that tree. I will always be here for you, no matter what you need."" (I'll Love You Forever by Munsch has a similar theme.) The lesson for an older child is to become more aware of the gifts given to them. A school age child will begin to see the unfairness inherent in the relationship and also begin to see things from a parent's perspective. With an older child, you could say, ""Sometimes when I read this book, I feel like there is something missing in the relationship of the boy and the tree"" or ""Sometimes when I read this book it makes me happy, and sometimes it makes me sad."" Then let your child talk. Gratitude is such an important lesson. The lesson for parents is to not expect gratitude, but to give freely, because that's what it means to truly love your child. To myself, I would ask, ""Are there times when I should be more like the tree with my kids?"" It's a call to be your most loving, giving self, not because you are being thanked, but because that's what it means to love. If you are religious, this is akin to being the Buddha or being like Jesus (two examples). The wonder of this book, though, is that it works subconsciously. You don't actually have to talk about it at all to benefit from what it has to teach."
Have I lost my daughter?,"As adolescents become adults, they will go through the phase typically where they don't like or want to be around their parents.  This seems to me to be beyond that standard part of growing up. You should seek counselling, heck maybe for the whole family so you can find the root cause.  There is something going on at school or at home that is driving a wedge between you and your daughter that you are not aware of.  As the parent, it's up to you to step up and make her go to counselling and to not quit until you know what is going on. The other thing to do is eliminate medical conditions.  Certain neurological disorders can cause this behavior.  Have your daughter checked out by your physician. As a side note, not matter what happens do not kick your child out of the house.  You are way better off knowing that at least there is a safe place for her to sleep, and can be reasonably confident that she isn't doing anything you don't want her too. ( like drugs, drinking, or worse )  Bottom line:  She is the daughter, you're the parent.  Don't quit on her."
My 21-year-old adult son hates me,"This is a situation in which you cannot change your son's behavior; you need to either adjust your expectations (i.e. change yourself, the only person you really have control over), or let him suffer the consequences of his bad behavior (i.e. ask him to respect his agreement or to leave.) You have struggled with your son's attitude for a long time. He's an adult now; you shouldn't still have to be struggling with rebellion. The vast majority of parents love their children dearly, and when they don't turn out to be kind, compassionate, honest and possessing integrity, parents often wonder if they did something wrong; they feel guilty. This guilt can sometimes override their better judgement, and being a compassionate person puts the parent at an even greater risk of being taken advantage of by an immature offspring. Only you know why you allowed your son to move back in. Maybe that was the right thing to do back then; maybe it wasn't. But it's done. What do you do now? Your son seems to use blame shifting like a pro. Blame shifting is normal when you're 5 years old, but it isn't in an adult. In fact, when it's done all the time, it's a form of emotional abuse (and I do not use the word abuse lightly.) The problem is that while we all blame-shift sometimes (that's what makes the ""Thanks, Obama"" meme so funny), if the behavior is not confronted and corrected by the person doing it (in this case, your son), we will never really improve ourselves. Giving your son consequences is an opportunity to improve himself; you can look at it as not only your parental duty, but a gift. Here are some things you might think about to help you cope with blame-shifting: I would recommend that you pick a quiet time to have a sit-down talk with your son. (If he refuses, reread the above.) During your talk, ask not only about his expectations of you, but about his feelings as well. Tell him about your expectations and feelings as well. Then, as childish as it might seem, draw up a contract outlining what you believe are reasonable expectations. They might include things like Have him sign it, and hang it on the refrigerator. If he refuses to sign it, tell him he has exactly 30 days to find someplace else to live. In the US, you have to give 30 days notice before you can evict someone, so this is a serious affair. Please remember that letting your son mistreat you without accepting responsibility for his actions is not doing him any kind of favor at all, let alone what it does to you. When you've given him notice, call a lawyer to let him know (lawyers practicing solo in family law are usually quite affordable. The bigger the firm, the greater the cost.) Then stick to your guns if you have to move his stuff out to the curb yourself and change the locks. Always repeat to yourself that you're doing this for him, too. It's time to stop the crazy-making. You have my best wishes for achieving a peaceful home and life. You deserve it. Everyone does. Edited to add: If your son is no longer in your house, the legalities of putting him out are no longer relevant, so what's left is I just want him to grow up and have a happy and healthy life. I'm not here to place all the blame on my son. I'm here to gain knowledge about what I can do to change myself, and hopefully help my son help himself.  There is nothing you can do to change others, but you can have a better relationship with your son by learning more about boundaries, how to set realistic ones and how to enforce them. Your son might learn from you how to respect boundaries, and hopefully, if you set good, healthy boundaries, he might learn one aspect of what it takes to establish and maintain healthy relationships. But that's about the extent of any influence you might have in shaping your son unless you want to spring for therapy for him, if he would even agree to it.  There is a lot of turmoil and more than a few issues here; if you are very serious about learning about yourself, why you've become more of a ""push-over"", and what would be most helpful in self care and caring for others, I would suggest getting into therapy."
My daughter's friend faked having cancer - our daughter found out via Facebook and is devastated. What do we do?,"I'm from the UK too.

What's wrong with Dr Seuss?,"What's wrong with Dr Seuss he asked?
To find an answer, I've been tasked.
His books on cats are widely read,
In libraries, schools, or just in bed. Is it because he writes such blubber
that turns a child's tongue into rubber?
Nonsense words and silly rhymes
Confusing children at bedtimes. Or maybe it's the politics
Of chicks on blocks and clocks on bricks?
Perhaps they're reading too much in
To books designed to make kids grin? Maybe they didn't have enough
Of Seuss' funny childrens' stuff?
It gave them hurty-wurty brains
To read that book ""again, again""! Dr Seuss, the politician?
The silly rhymes? The repetition?
I've always thought these books were fun.
I don't know why; go ask your mum!"
How can I prevent my parents' divorce?,"I'm sorry to hear about your parents.   Unfortunately, there's nothing you can do.  And, whether it helps or not, there was nothing you could have done.  This is not your fault. Also, don't be angry at your parents.  The situation they will be putting you in is not fair; no doubt about it.  But, for your parents, it takes a lot to recognize that the relationship they started in isn't the one they currently find themselves in.  And, honestly, living the lie of a relationship may be more destructive than breaking it up. Divorce is a messy business, and it impact everyone, especially the kids.  You have friends here to help you get through it.  The people here have been the parents.  Many of them were the kids, like you.  Sometimes, they saw their own friends go through it. My closing thoughts, though they may not be the most comforting, are that, while you may not be able to stop your parents' divorce, you play a big role in the relationship with your parents after the fact.  Resentment and hate do not help.  Recognize that your parents are still your parents, and they still love you, even if they don't love each other.  Believe it or not, they are people too: people who have their own worries, fears, and insecurities.  Try to extend to them all the understanding you can."
How do you teach a child religious views?,"I agree with Tim H insofar as requiring a child to pray when he is too young to have any idea what he's doing, besides folding his hands and repeating after you, is pointless.  As to the second part of your question, how to raise a child without forcing your religious beliefs on him... I come from a religion that specifically forbids one from proselytizing, even to one's own children.  First of all, some pros and cons of this approach (all from my own observation -- to my knowledge not enough of us live under such strict rules about religious teaching to have any kind of study done): Pros Children who are raised in a One Right Way environment tend either not to question religious leaders, or to rebel against them, regardless of what beliefs and behaviors they espouse. The child who accepts the indoctrination tends not to see religious leaders as normal people, just as prone to human failings as the rest of us, but as superior, and are less likely than kids who chose their own path to question religious leaders, even when those leaders take action that blatently violates the religion they preach. For example, the Bible clearly references Mary breastfeeding the infant Jesus, however when I lived in central Texas some of the churches taught that breastfeeding was dirty and sinful.  Even by pointing out relevant Gospel passages, the nurses in the NICU could not convince these young mothers, whose children were already off to a rough start and needed all the help they could get, to breast feed.  The preacher said it was sexual abuse, so they would not do it. Some realize that they've been duped into not questioning anything and rebel against the religion, sometimes in antagonistic or self-destructive ways, because they don't know how to make another choice.  Even when the religion might have been a positive influence in these kids' lives, they won't see it -- it's forever branded as oppressive in their minds. Children who choose their own religious path gain a deeper understanding of whatever path they choose, rather than just learning enough to go through the motions. Children who choose their own religious path tend to find it easier to understand and deal with people from other cultures.  After you've gone through the normal adolescent journey of trying many paths to see what fits, it's kind of natural to take an anthropologist's views of faiths you don't share. Cons Of course, not indoctrinating your child from birth does teach them that religion is a choice.  They may not choose your religion.  They'll be especially skeptical of hypocrisy (a good thing in my opinion).  This isn't to say that indoctrinating them necessarily works, but not doing so also sets up the expectation that you will love and accept them even if they choose another path. Not indoctrinating all children will cause a religion not to become more widespread, at least not quickly.  Being a minority means having less power in the face of the majority religions -- and being a majority usually involves not only proselytizing, but forced conversion and violence. I'd rather my child have to struggle a bit than to become one of the amoral bullies waging war for God(s), but if your particular faith is in danger of becoming a minority, you should be aware of the dangers.  Most of my family was forcibly converted to Catholicism a couple of generations ago.  In 2002, I had a Christian preacher try to beat me to a miscarriage after a neighbor found out my family wasn't Christian and ""outed"" us.  The neighbor who saved me, by the way, was Christian, but he was baptized as an adult -- he was not indoctrinated in as a child. Assuming that you are still committed to giving your child a choice, here's how we do it: Rule #1 is: ""Do not answer the unasked question.""  When a child (or an adult for that matter) needs something, he or she will seek it.  Never lecture on religion, or subject your child to others doing so (e.g. church service or catechism).  Live according to your beliefs, and answer questions when your child asks them, not before.  This doesn't mean, of course, that your child shouldn't attend services or lectures if he/she has become curious and asked to do so on his/her own initiative. This teaches a number of important lessons: Expose your child to good people of different religions.  Answer questions as honestly as you can, and let the people in your child's life know that you are fine with them explaining their beliefs as long as they don't descend into One Right Way-ism. When you talk about religion, be it your own or someone else's, know what you are talking about, and make sure your child understands that the popular idea of a religion doesn't always resemble the truth.  For example: Those are just a few examples, and might seem more apropos to a discussion about religious tolerance than one about finding one's own path, but the learning process of someone who has a choice of religion is a little different than someone who grows up to believe what they are taught they must believe.  This is an important lesson, because it's the one that enables a child raised with religious choice to find direction: On the surface -- the level most unthinking practitioners never pass -- every religion is the same.  There are holidays, an oral or written history, some prayers, chants, or songs, rules for behavior, and ritual.  The important stuff is below the surface.  So, if you don't know why you are ""praying for food"" don't do it.  If it's a ritual that has some meaning within the context of a coherent belief system, then go ahead and do it.  The important thing is that religious practice not be based on pop culture or ""because $religious_leader said so"" but that it enrich your lives in some way.  Understanding the differences in how different paths see and interact with the world, and understanding how they came to be that way, is how one chooses. Raising your child without enforcing your own religious views is certainly harder -- there are a lot more questions to answer, and in your case there would likely be some sort of fallout from members of your church, as all the Christian sects I'm aware of require that children be indoctrinated from birth, and some go so far as to prohibit investigation of other paths. However, giving your child the choice of how he or she will come to see the world is incredibly rewarding.  It means that he/she will never feel the need to choose between his/her religious calling and his/her relationship with you.  Your child will not be easy prey for someone peddling religion in order to take money or control, or for a zealot who wants to use violence in the name of God(s).  It also means that your child will learn what makes up belief systems so that, whether the context is morality, religion, business, politics, or anything else, your child can separate snake oil and self-serving hypocrisy from beliefs and models of behavior worthy of him/her."
"From what age should one heed ""But I'm not cold!""?","You should listen to your child as soon as they are able to offer an opinion. This is true even if the child is wrong.  (Note that listening to a child is not the same as following the child's wishes.) Here it sounds like there's some argument between the child and a parent.  The parent knows it's cold outside, and tells the child to put a coat on.  The child is in a warm home, and so doesn't see the need for a coat.  In this situation the parent can just take the coat with them, and offer it to the child when they're outside and the child realises how cold it is and that they need a coat.  This makes life easier for everyone.  It encourages the child to make their own decisions.  It respects the rights of the child. It avoids arguments. In these kinds of situations - where the decision is easy to change; where harm is unlikely; where other people aren't being disrupted - there's no good reason to ignore the child's wishes."
How do you cope in the first few months?,"Our first couple months were... bad. From that experience I can give you these pieces of advice: Realize that you are most likely not in this alone. Friends and family are a wonderful thing. Especially those that have kids, they'll know and understand. If one of them calls to say they want to come over and see the baby, and asks if you need anything... don't just automatically say no. Stop and think. Have you been living on delivered take out and frozen meals for a few days in a row, got a tenner in your wallet? Ask 'em to stop at the store you know they're driving past and grab $10 worth of fresh fruit on the way. The ones that have kids are going to ask to help, they've been there before, they won't think any less of you for accepting that offer to help. Do it. Realize that no child is a perfect text book demonstration. Neither are parents. Case in point: nursing. There's some figure in all the literature we were given about how a baby should suckle for 15 minutes on each side for a feeding at whatever particular age we were at at the time. (1 week after discharge I think?) All the books, the doctors, everyone said it. No way we were getting that. We (especially my wife) were feeling like miserable failures as parents. In the middle of one such feeding attempt, as she was holding him on her lap and trying to get my help to get him into the position shown in the book the phone rang, it was our doula calling just to see how things were going. I think she heard the break down in my voice when I said ""not so hot actually."" She was at our house in about 20 minutes. When all was said and done, and the tears stopped flowing, the book was thrown out the proverbial window, at least metaphorically, and we stopped trying to live up to the text book case. It is a summary/average, not a mold you must fit. Turns out what all those things forgot to say, was that 15 minutes total was the important part... not 15 solid continuous minutes suckling. Prioritize and don't sweat the small stuff. You may not vacuum the house for a couple weeks, unless you're really sloppy, it won't really matter. Dishes may pile up in the sink a bit longer than you would normally let them, again, it won't really matter in the long run. You might not even shave every day (assuming you're the type that does that), so what if you get a little furry. In particular: You're going to be eating meals that are quick and easy to make (and ideally make in a larger quantity so that you can have leftovers) so you might not be eating as ""nice"" as you normally do. But it's going to be important (double extra for mom if she's nursing) to be eating well... be sure to avoid the junk aisle when you do get out to the store. I normally loathe frozen store bought meals, but they were very useful those first few weeks. Laundry. You're going to be doing a lot of small loads on short notice to deal with baby messes. Scrape as much of the mess into the toilet as you can first (either kind of mess, doesn't matter... it's flushable.) then run a quick rinse cycle with the baby clothes/urp rags, etc. But then, when you actually run the real load with soap and all... toss in a few of your clothes to to bulk up the load... yeah, they won't get the fancy fabric softener or bleach, but oh well, they'll be clean and you'll have some underwear in the drawerbasket again. Find a shoulder to cry on that knows what's going on, preferably one that's had kids recently. But here's the weird part... not family, or close friends... but someone you can trust. For us, it was our Doula. She proved to be a massive life saver, not only with the above referenced nursing issue but a couple other mountains out of molehills that day. Was that a conversation we could have had with parents, or close friends? I doubt it. But this was the woman who had been in the LDRP room with us for close to 12 hours... any embarrassment from having her help figure out why the nipple doesn't stay in baby's mouth... yeah, pretty minor by comparison. I realize with a 5 week premie you may not have the luxury of such a relationship. Sleep when the baby sleeps. I don't care if it's 3 in the afternoon, and you have a million things to do, if you haven't gotten your 7 or 8 hours of sleep in the last 24 hours, lay down and take a nap too. One final note of closing that might sound contradictory to some of what I just said. When I say you should accept the help of friends and family, I mean help in keeping you two and the house going to support you and your wife supporting the baby. Try to keep all the baby care on your own plate, in your own hands... in the long run you won't regret your mom baking a tray of lasagna for you all to have for diner, but you will regret not being the one to change the diaper, or bring the baby from the cradle to mom for a feeding, or bounce them on your shoulder for a post feeding urp."
How can we get some free time (on daily basis)?,"Welcome in the world of exhausted parents! The most important thing first: The great news is while right now you can't really see it, it will get better. What you're going through right now won't last. Can you suggest some ways to carv out some free time for ourselves during the day Take turns: You'll have to live with the change the baby brings to your routine. Your activities as a couple will become significantly less frequent (I was about to write ""nonexistent"" but that might be overdoing it). But that doesn't mean each of you can't take some time off every other day. For example, give each other a free evening once or twice a week. Go drink a beer with a friend, get some more sleep, go running, do something for yourself with that time (maybe just an hour). Stop sweating the small stuff: Lots of things aren't all that important right now. For example, if the garden grows over because nobody mows it, or if dust collects because you only vacuum half as much as before, or if dirty dishes collect for a day or two before you wash them, it doesn't really matter in the big scheme of things. So drop doing things that aren't absolutely necessary (and I don't mean just household work -- maybe step back your work schedule too if that's possible). It won't be for long -- you can pick up speed again in six months or in a year. Try introducing feeding your baby with a bottle if you don't already. It might not work, or not reliably, but once it does, feeding becomes independent from having mom present. Also, sometimes formula will satisfy the baby for a bit longer than mother's milk. Simplify taking care of your baby: With our first baby, we tried to do everything exactly right. We measured the temperature of the bottle with a thermometer. We checked and rechecked and discussed everything we did because we weren't sure it was the right thing to do. Turns out they don't die if you get a few things wrong, as long as you get the important stuff right (never ever shake them in a fit of anger, for example, but don't worry if baby prefers to sleep on it's back, or it's stomach, or in whatever position -- there's no need to put it back in the ""right"" position every ten minutes, etc). All this fussing took an incessant amount of time. Then our twins came along, and we no longer had the luxury of spending all this time worrying about whether we did things the ""right"" way. Guess what: They all turned out fine. But in the end, there is no way around the fact that babies take an incredible amount of time, and some even more than others (our first one was a screamer - he did little besides screaming in his waking hours for the first seven months, took forever to fall asleep and never slept more than two hours at a time). So I'm back to my first sentence: It won't last. You only have to survive a few months, and things will get much easier. In the meantime, you'll grow as a person. At the end of it, you'll pity all the people who never had a baby and still don't understand what it means to be responsible for another human being."
How do I calm a frustrated 6-year-old?,"It starts with her making a mistake, and me correcting it. So don't correct her. Especially her schoolwork should be hers and hers alone. A teacher does not expect 100% correct work, they want to see how well a student has understood the current topic. Leave the corrections to the teacher. And she may even go back to school without complete homework (but trying is a must), tell the teacher that she didn't understand or couldn't solve some of it and get another explanation.  Failure is a part of life. Accepting one's own limitations and dealing with failures or mistakes can be hard, but every child must learn it at some point. And yes, this may mean tantrums and tears, but the less you try to solve it, the better. You can be a sounding board if she needs to vent or someone to console her if that's what she needs, but don't try to solve her problem - unless she explicitly asks for help. Taking her work to another place is for me a sign that she wants to be left alone and work through it on her own. Give her the freedom to take responsibility - think how much more proud she'll be if she solved it alone and without you correcting and improving her work. "
Should we circumcise our son?,"This was a difficult decision for us, as well.  I was convinced that circumcision was the wrong choice for us (despite my upbringing teaching me that all boys should be circumcised), but my wife was hesitant, for exactly the same reason you cited. I did some research, and we were surprised to find that circumcision rates were much lower than we had expected.  In our area, the doctors we asked said that it was roughly 50% of the male babies.  It turns out that this is not too far from the national average in the US. We came up with a list of pros and cons for circumcision, and eventually decided to not have our son circumcised.  Here is the list that we came up with: For circumcision: Against circumcision: Despite the claims, circumcision is painful, stressful, and traumatic to an infant.  Even the best methods of anesthesia are only partially effective. Once done, it cannot be undone. There is a risk of infection and other complications. Poorly performed circumcisions can leave scarring. Religion.  Some religions are opposed to circumcision. In the end, we decided to leave him uncircumcised, with the understanding that if he decides he does want to be circumcised, he can always opt for the procedure later."
My 4-year-old refers to himself as me,"Kids that age learn a lot by imaginative play. It's how they make sense of the world and experiment with different responses to events. Pretending to be an adult is very common.
Playing along is a good opportunity to show empathy and teach better responses. You might say,  I'm Eric. I'm sad because I couldn't find my toy. I wonder if I should cry or ask my dad to help me find it.  This is how kids open up to you. Take advantage of it while it's still relatively easy. "
How should I handle an 8 year old lawyering and quibbling?,"I am glad you used the term ""lawyering"".  I have been on both sides of this situation. As the child, I distinctly recall the fun in ""outsmarting"" my parents.  I considered them as incapable of expressing themselves well.  The more they argued for me to ""get the point"", the more I thought they didn't ""get the point"".  They never did succeed in their goal and since my goal was to prove they would fail, I thought for a long time that I had succeeded in my goal. Today, the more detailed a contract, the more fun I have in finding out where it fails... where the loophole exists.  Think you can cover every possible scenario?  I love it when you try. As someone who develops software solutions for merchants, I frequently advise the CSR's that those asking for specific features never know what they actually want... they know what they intend.  Find out what problem they are trying to solve and solve that -- they won't care which ""feature"" solves it, just that it is solved. With my own child, I do not give specific instructions (except in emergencies), I state the intention.  For example, ""Your room needs to be clean"", ""The kitchen needs to be clean"", ""Select something to do over the summer related to animals and which requires you getting out of the house"" (yes, this one has 2 intentions being met [animals is because she wants to be a vet]). Occasionally I have made a mistake and given a specific instruction.  Being her father's daughter, she promptly ""lawyered up"".  My response was direct, ""You really want to play that game with me?  I enjoy it.  Do you think you will?"" It's only fun if it succeeds.  However, I suggest that speaking in highly-specific terms to someone of a nature similar to mine will never succeed no matter the threats... it's an internal joy you can't take away by continuing, so perhaps the underlying point they are making without knowing it is of benefit: ""tell me what you intend without trying to tell me the steps."" There's a side effect of this, too.  ""How to Win Friends And Influence People"" has a whole chapter on ""Give A Dog A Good Name"" which concludes with the point ""Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to""... namely, by stating your intention and allowing that to be fulfilled in whatever manner they think it should, they are very likely to do more than had you asked something specific in the first place. Where they fall short, giving them ""an out"" by asking, ""Nice job.  Did you forget _ _ _ _?  It will be perfect when that is done, too"" takes away any fight and gets the job done. Finally, the lesson of speaking via intention instead of by specifics is something which has served me well in life.  I may not know how what I want is achieved, but I do care that it is achieved."
12 year old boy is totally out of control,"You have my sympathy, and a lot of it. I'm so sorry you're going through this. Part of this is the age.*  TL;DR: You're not alone. Many have walked this path and come through on the other side with a ""good"" kid. Find a good family therapist. ...the therapist didn't really seem to help much mostly because he refused to cooperate. Change is hard to effect. It is hard enough to change your own behaviors; it's next to impossible to change others. However, he is 12, and you're his parent. Helping him to become a better person, using any reasonable means at your disposal to do so, is within your job description. I'll presume you've tried talking to him, telling him how his behavior makes you feel, etc., and that that got you nowhere. I believe the next and best step for you, because of how advanced his aggression is, is to find a family therapist for all of you (his siblings are affected, too.) Go alone (or with the child's other parent) at first and work on a multi-factorial plan, including discipline, how to disengage, and how to get him to come to family therapy. If money is a serious problem, call a crisis hotline and find out what might be available at low or no cost to you, like parenting classes, etc. But even if money is a serious problem, a therapist can work on many levels with you, so this is probably your best option.** Though you may not realize it, at 12 you still have a great deal of control over him. You are his legal guardian, you can make decisions which are in keeping with his best interests (one of which is to send him off to boarding school.) You control the money. You control the food. You control the electronics. To a great extent, you control the traveling, you control who gets to come into your house, etc. You control a lot of important things. You can use these things as motivators or as deterrents. You just need help in how to do so wisely and effectively. Again, because the push-back is going to be harsh, it's best to have help and support in instituting change, so start with someone who can help you as soon as possible. If he refuses to go to therapy, refuse to take him anywhere but school (or use whatever motivation you and your therapist have decided on.) You're allowed to do this. If he sits like a lump at therapy sessions, it doesn't mean he's not listening and learning. At individual therapy, learn how to engage and disengage with the kind of behavior your son exhibits to manipulate you. You need to not take his behavior personally, even if it feels very personal. Being rational while hurting is difficult, so learn to engage/disengage with his behavior rationally. Practice in your mind, practice with your therapist. (The consequences for bad behavior need to be worked out in advance, best with the therapist, and laid out in a calm discussion with your son.) When he screams at you or throws f-bombs or anything else to disrupt your thinking, turn on the rational side, and deal with the behavior. For example, if he is shouting, no matter what he is shouting, just refuse to ""have this conversation while you're shouting"". That's all you need to do initially, and repeat without emotion as often as needed. Depending on what his ultimate goal is for shouting, you can simply leave the room if he doesn't stop, or - if you suspect he wants the room for some reason - sit down and say nothing in response. But life as usual doesn't just go on. He gets no rewards for abusing you; no electronics, no trips to friends' houses, etc. The consequences need to be consistently applied. Whatever you choose to do, take care of yourself. You are not necessarily a failure as a parent simply because you have an out of control child. Children are not born into this world as a blank slate. No sane parent raises a child to have autism, ADHD, OCD, ODD (look this one up and read about it; see if it applies), schizophrenia, or to become a sociopath. So cut yourself a generous amount of slack for the time being, and work on keeping yourself sane and healthy. Meditate, journal, discuss in therapy, discuss with your journal (great because it slows things down), discuss with God/nature/whatever powers that be, anything. But let it all out somewhere, sometime. If nothing works even with therapy, and/or the therapist recommends it, a Psychiatrist specializing in Adolescent Behavior might be the following step. I wish you and your son the best of luck. Edited to add: It is possible that in therapy, you will have to address some of your parenting choices as well as your son's current behavior. A good therapist knows that family dynamics are critical here, and will facilitate your son having important, meaningful conversations with you if there really is a problem on your part(s) as parents. You do need to be prepared and be willing to hear what your son has to say. Real, lasting change often involves changing family dynamics as well as individual behavior. **Parenting was a joy for me until my kids hit 11. Honestly, at 11, it was like some alien looked at a calendar and saw it was time to take over my children. I had to learn more than I ever thought I would at that stage. Luckily, my last was the hardest, so I'd been through it already. **I have a lot of experience with mental illness and substance abuse. Because of this, I have worked with more kids like this than I can count, even though it's not my primary field. But because I'm a physician, I'm also an interventionist. Hence my recommendation for therapy first, and second (psychiatrist). I also would not rule out a wilderness program if it is deemed by the psychiatrist as beneficial. Therapy gone wild

Teaching my son a language he doesn't want to learn,"Yes, I do have another idea. Most sources agree that immersion is the best way to really learn a language. So bringing your son to a school where English is the primary language is a good start. Dedicated lessons at home sound somewhat superfluous and I can see why your son resists.  You are in the rare position of being able to teach English as a (presumably native?) speaker. And have tried to talk to him in that language. So my recommendation is that you turn into the parent who speaks only English. And while in the beginning you understand answers in 
Japanese, this should end at some point. Use your wise judgement to determine when your son should be capable of switching to English. Be patient, repeat, explain in simpler words, use pantomime, everything is fine. And only if you really, really can't get something across, a word or two in Japanese may be ok in the beginning. So far, this is just the standard recommendation for bilingual parenting. But I have one strict limitation: Do not, as tempting as it may be, use the conversation to correct your son's attempts at speaking. React like you would for toddlers learning to speak: if you feel the urge to correct, either bite your tongue or gently ask for clarification by repeating the correct phrase. The child will almost automatically switch to ""proper"" language once it has heard and used it enough.  And of course it might be necessary to make spending time with you super alluring - find projects, go on outings, everything to make you the fun and preferred parent for a while. So the ""I don't know?"" of now starts to bug him and he tries to understand and participate in breaking down the language barrier. Plus you might have to remove mom from the scene. All parties know that she would be the perfect translator plus the emotional anchor whilst you are the ""new one"". This should give you enough practice soon, so that if your wife is really unavailable, you two boys will manage just fine. In short: Be a partner who happens to speak  another language, not a disturbing factor who wants to pressure him into some new form of exercise. Oh, and I'm not saying that there should be no discipline. I'm with you as far as household chores and school stuff goes. I just advise against opening another, totally unnecessary potential battlefield  of conflicts."
Is it ok to disagree in front of the kids?,"I firmly believe it is inevitable that two people in close contact over time will disagree; that this is part of being a alive and having healthy desires. Failure to openly disagree because of cultural submission, politeness, etc., should not be mistaken as lack of disagreement. The way in which people disagree - openly, respectfully, cherishing the other, with a mind towards common ground - can be healthy and can bring them closer together. Alternatively it can be unhealthy, resulting in emotional harm to one degree or another to one party. What you espouse in your comments as the ideal is in fact very far from it. If you can't model how to disagree in love, you can't model a vital part of cherishing a person. Personally, I think it's perfectly fine to disagree in front of children - about some things. Points to consider: I would say, though, that parents should provide a united front at all times in the matter of establishing rules and consequences for children, and discuss differences of opinion in private. This helps to prevent the child playing one parent off against the other.  Edited to add in response to a comment: We used to have family conferences - including the kids - where we all contributed to the discussion and made joint decisions together - on what was and wasn't allowed, why (if this was a top-down decision) and appropriate consequences. The kids were often given new privileges this way, and when they broke the rules, they knew they had already agreed to their appropriateness before, so it cut down on the ""no fair!!!"" aspect. This to me is more about decision making within a family (which does involve some disagreement), but not what I would categorize as parents disagreeing in front of the kids."
How can I make my kids passionate in science while being religious?,"Rest assured that science and religion are not neccessarily a contradiction. Some of the best scientists of past and present time were deeply religious - and came from different religious backgrounds. As one commenter wrote, Georges Lemaître being one relatively modern example.  The question of how to connect religious beliefs and teachings and scientific observation and the consequences thereof has been a subject of discussion from Galilei over Keppler to the leading figures of quantum physics and atomic theory (Heisenberg, Einstein, Bohr,...) the ethical implications of their work even more important with regard to WWII, Nazi Germany and Hiroshima. In my - admittedly very personal - experience, neither science nor religion alone is sufficient for a well-rounded education and upbringing of a child. Religion is one cornerstone of our societies (different countries and religions, but the same principles apply). Even if you personally choose not to believe, the base values and teachings can be found in many aspects of life, from manners via morals to law. Religion may serve as moral compass and give (perceived?) additional value to an individual's life. A sense of community, connection and acceptance is often (albeit not exclusively) found in groups with a religious background. Yet, science serves a better purpose in understanding the mechanisms of the world around us - if I want to explain how water freezes to ice or evaporates or why a light bulb emits light, I choose scientific fact without batting an eye. Your children are still small, so you have plenty of time to work with their natural curiosity: They will observe many things that lead to scientific explanations. The dualism of religious teachings (e.g. how the world was created) vs. scientific observations (as most observant kindergardeners will notice at some point - there are no dinosaurs in the scriptures...) will spark many interesting discussions in your future, but so will questions on friendship, loyalty and first love that may lend themselves to referring back to the teachings of whatever religion you belong to.  Work with these occasions, conduct age-appropriate scientific experiments and encourage their natural curiosity. Then trust in their ability to find the balance between religion and science that works for them. You sound like an excellent role-model."
How do you raise an intelligent and happy daughter in a sexist world?,"Firstly, I have to admit that while reading your question I was wondering if you're being serious. For me (as a hopeful future father with the same questions in mind), your solutions sound shocking and I would certainly advise against them. To reflect on some points... 1) ""no TV ever, no movies, no pop music, no magazines"" Does this also mean no friends? Because if she has friends she will be exposed to those and other influences.
She will feel excluded from society if she is forbidden to see any of it, and she will eventually hate you for it. The most rebellious people I know (who often ended up rebelling too hard), are those who had parents doing exactly what you describe to them - and to a far lesser degree. This will backfire, and it will end up hurting both of you in the process. 2) ""no public or even private schooling"" Are you an expert on everything? With all due respect (I don't know you), why do you want to limit your child to your own knowledge and worldview?
Personally, I hope my children will know more than I do, and change my views as they grow up. We are not perfect, neither me nor you. 3) ""Education will be in the form of critical thinking, primary and secondary research, one to one teaching by me, independent learning, and plenty of world travel and new experiences once she's old enough."" This sounds great, but is in absolute contradiction with your suggested methods.
Critical thinking is good. Questioning things is good. Independent learning is good. However, to get there, one needs to be exposed to many opposing worldviews, philosophies, sources of knowledge. By being her only teacher, as well as her mother, your opinion will not be questioned, and she will not learn to really think critically - just to be critical of the same things you are critical of - in a learned way, not self-reached. Additionally, I would ask you to consider how you can teach someone critical thinking without exposing them to anything to be critical about (those supposedly bad influences).
You don't educate a person by not exposing them to bad things. You educate them by showing them the bad things and commenting together on why they are bad (in addition, this should be done more by asking questions and letting the person reach their own connclusions, instead of providing answers in a dogmatic way). 4) ""Mainly, she will also be taught how to be confident (disregard other peoples judgements as worthless)"" This is one of the biggest problems of modern kids. They have too much confidence and too little real substance to actually be confident about.
Doing this is the recipe for raising a spoiled kid who feels special and entitled. Instead, I would suggest to teach her to listen to everyone's opinion (or ""judgement""), and evaluate it for herself. See if there's any truth there or not. Often, there is, and one failing to realize that feels no need to change (even when they are doing something completely wrong), and regardless of all of us thinking our children ""special"" (or even ""perfect""), we all do want them to grow and improve - change. 5) ""do whatever she wants as long as she's making the intelligent choice"" Please do consider that two intelligent well-meaning people can have different opinions on what is an intelligent choice. If at some point you think a choice of hers is not intelligent, that doesn't necessarily mean you're right, or that she's wrong. 6) ""...and have unshakeable self belief."" Just a remark: this can't really be taught, this comes from previous accomplishments through both success and failure.
Any other way will be self-belief that will shatter the first time she fails. In short, I would say try to control her waaaaay less.
Don't treat her as a project, but as an amazing human being (who will have her own wishes which you should respect and help her accomplish them)."
Should I be concerned about my 1-year-old and her mother moving in with a man I've never met?,"I suggest you invite the guy out for a beer to get to know him.  Make it clear that you are not jealous, that you wish them well, and that the only thing you care about his how he treats your daughter and her mother. Your concern for her mother is exactly that, concern for your daughter's mother.  Not concern for your ex.   There's a lot of crappy stuff in this world and your daughter having another person who cares for her and looks out for her is a good thing."
Should you play games with a toddler that they're very good at and always win?,"If the child really enjoys the game, what you need to do is not making him stop playing it. Teaching kids that they're not supposed to win at things, or play things they are good at, is just as bad as teaching them they can win anything they try. The problem with letting them win is that it skews their idea of how good they are, and how much opposition they will have when trying out new things. In this case, the kid is just good at the game and winning fairly. What you should do is either practice the game yourself (so you become more of a match for him. That might even teach him about practice, except from the other end) or you need to find him better opposition.  (Also, you might want to try and find out why a 3 year old is better at Memory than you are. Either your nephew is very clever, or you have some kind of memory issue.)"
How can I handle kids telling me extremely boring stuff?,"To some degree, kids need you to act interested when you aren't; you can't fully avoid their 'boring' talk without it leaving them feeling unheard or unappreciated.  There have already been two great answers on how to participate in the topics you aren't interested in that I fully endorse and thus won't repeat. That being said, your kids are old enough that you get some freedom to start trying to drive the conversation to things you're more interested in, after you have done your due diligence and listened - and ideally found a way to participate, even if you aren't that interested - to whatever obsession the child wanted to ramble about. Let them know your ignorance to a topic It's okay to say something like ""Oh videogames, I don't really know about those"" or ""I always was bad with yo-yo as a kid"" etc.  This isn't saying 'no we can't talk about that', but it is your 'subtle' indicator to a child that this is not a topic you are going to be able to contribute in.  By itself that won't do much, but it does lead into my next advice... It's okay to say you want to talk about something else after listening to them for awhile Shutting a kid down every time they want to talk about something you don't like isn't a good idea, the kid needs to feel you value them and thus their thoughts and interests.  However, a kid also needs to learn that they can, and should, strive for conversation topics everyone enjoys. So the compromise here is to listen for awhile, show interest in them and what matters to them. Then, after a long enough period that you have clearly demonstrated that interest and attention, you can then politely remind them that you don't understand video games and so can't really participate in the discussion. Now you can ask if they want to talk about some topic you know you both have a more shared interest in. Yes, I am suggesting being a bit overt when you change the topic, you should be politely saying ""I can't really be part of this conversation, so let's talk about this other one instead.""  Overt and blatant, if polite, is perfectly fine with a younger child such as your 9 year old.  Even if being that overt with, say, an 18 year old would be mildly insulting, it's okay with a child who hasn't learned enough about conversations to pick up on the more subtle nuances of them yet. Basically, you are modeling how conversations should go, by giving a hint early on that 'this isn't a topic I can/want to be part of' and later reminding them of that when you change the topic so they can slowly pick up that they need to adjust their own topic of conversation based off what the other person in the conversation demonstrates an interest and desire to participate in. Again though, you only get to do this after you did your parental duty of feigning interest in their topic first.  I'll also point out it won't always work, quite often a young child will miss even an overt request to change the topic and if that happens, well you just sort of have to deal with it.  Again at 9 they don't fully get that what interests them isn't interesting to you.  You're modeling how the conversation should go, they won't always pick up on it.  As the parent you're still stuck feigning interest if the kid insists on a topic, because making them feel heard is the most important thing you can do as a parent. You get one veto topic You can't ignore everything a child has an interest in, but presuming a child is interested in numerous things you can pick the one thing you are least interested in and keep reinforcing that this one topic is one you can't really do.  So long as it's just one thing you stay consistent on and there are plenty of other topics the child is interested in that you do allow them to discuss with you, the child should be able to understand the distinction between 'really don't want to talk about this topic' and 'not interested in you or your passions.'  Just don't make your 'veto' anything too generic, like all video games if your kid is an obsessed gamer. I do have a sort of Minecraft veto with a nephew. He gets to discuss it a bit with me, but then I tend to redirect those conversations sooner than others with a reminder I really don't get/like Minecraft.  That does mean that now that he has a Zelda obsession I'm stuck discussing that video game, and it's 20 different iterations, with him since I've basically 'used up' my veto with Minecraft, but at least I know Zelda and a lot of it's earlier iterations so I don't feel quite as out of my depth.  Zelda may not be my ideal conversation topic, but it's better than Minecraft IMO so I consider it a win. Of course as time goes on you can manage a more granular process of having an 'absolutely don't want this' response to one topic and a ""okay we'll talk awhile but not as long"" on this topic etc, you aren't actually limited to exactly one and only one veto.  However at first stick to one, give the kid time to adjust to just that, and maybe later you can add a little more nuanced distinction or other things you want to avoid.  The main reason I say you get one veto though is to stress this is not something to abuse.  Such a veto should be limited to only the worst most offensive topics to you, you must still participate in discussing the majority of things the child wants, even if you find many of them boring. Non sequential can be used when you really need a change of topic Kids don't pick up on 'subtle' attempts to redirect them well, but they can still be easy to redirect.  Rather than the politer sort of redirection you might use with an adult you can use the bludgeoning approach of completely derailing their conversation with something else.  After you have participated in their passion for a bit wait until a slight lull in their rambling and throw in a ""Oh, hey, I just remembered I wanted to ask you about whatever"" It's a good idea to have a specific discussion already planned out to redirect them, one you are pretty sure they would be interested in participating in and ideally with a good 'excuse' for your non sequential change of topic.  I've been known to use the time a kid was talking to think about the change of topic I was going to use and how to most organically force it in. I find topical things, like discussing plans for some upcoming event or letting them know an interesting fact about a place or time, work well since they flow more naturally as an ""oh I just remembered this"" non sequential.  With the kids I regularly visit/mentor I also usually have one or two mini topics already picked out for the kids intended to teach them something that isn't being taught in schools so they generally expect a random ""oh were suppose to talk about this on this visit"" at some point during the day anyways. So long as the topic is one that might be interesting to the kids this usually works.  The catch is you can't overuse it, as I keep repeating you do need to participate in their hobbies and interests first before forcing another topic."
"My husband, who is my teen daughter's step father feels bad that he can't have a closer relationship with my daughter","Kids love their parents. This is true the vast majority of the time, even when the parent is abusive and manipulative to an extraordinary degree. Therefore it is extremely difficult to form a close relationship with a child if you are trying to replace their parent. or if you make the biological parent wrong, or otherwise say bad things about them or about their parenting. I don't know for sure that any of these things are happening, but it certainly sounds like your husband is trying to be her father because he (and you) perceives that to be something she is lacking. Of course her own dad is going to be the one to dance with her at her prom etc - he's her dad. He's been her dad for 16 years, and even though he hasn't been part of your life in any significant way for the last 4, he has been part of hers. Your other kids are grown - they likely no longer have a truly parent-child relationship with you, and therefore do not feel any pressure to see your husband as a parent either; they just see him as a great guy.  This said, there is no reason whatsoever that your husband can't have a great relationship with your daughter. As long as he is clear with her that he doesn't want to replace her dad, and as long as he doesn't say anything bad about her dad. He can say something like, ""I know your dad is very special to you, and I would never want to interfere with that. He's your dad, and he'll always be your dad. But you are also incredibly special and important to me, and while I don't want to try to be your dad, I am hoping that you'll let me be part of your life, because I do love and care about you as if you were my own child.""  He would also have to work to build that relationship outside regular family and school time - I think sometimes step-parents make the mistake of thinking that because they've built a close relationship with the parent of a child, that automatically spills over into having a close relationship with the child. Going to her sports events doesn't really count, because there's no real quality time in that - there's no chance for him to learn about who she is (as a rapidly maturing almost adult person), and no chance for her to learn who he is - outside his ""roles"" in her life as your husband and her teacher. I'm not sure what kind of venue would strike all of you as appropriate, but if he really wants to be close to her, they have to spend some one-on-one time in an environment that's conducive to conversation. And ideally it should be something she wants to do, like taking a road trip somewhere or something like that - not a sit down ""let's talk"" situation.  Anyway, if I've misread the situation, please feel free to correct me :) but I hope that helps. "
"What are the legal, emotional, and/or behavioral repercussions of confiscating money as a punishment?","I would be concerned that this form of punishment might end up teaching the wrong associations, because it artificially connects money to behavior which is not naturally about money. For example, I would be concerned that the children end up believing:"
Why do toddlers hate getting their face cleaned off with a wet washcloth and is there a better way?,Two things I can think of up front: Both of these options have choices. Kids like choices and a little control. Give them that and I'm sure they'll start getting used to it.
Is it safer to install a back seat car seat behind the driver or behind the passenger?,"The center position is the safest for a car seat. Not only is that somewhat logical (regardless of what side the car is impacted, there's distance between impact and child), but it is supported by research. That same study also indicates there was no statistically significant difference in the injury risk between the two sides of the car, only between the center and side positions. Seating position distribution for child occupants was as follows: left
  outboard (31%), center (28%), and right outboard (41%)... Child
  occupants seated in the center had an injury risk 43% less than
  children seated in either of the rear outboard positions. The injury risk was 0.27%, 0.17%, and 0.29% in the left outboard, center, and right outboard positions, respectively. No statistically significant difference in injury risk was found between child occupants in the right and left outboard positions; therefore, they were combined for additional analyses.  Kallan et al. Seating Patterns and Corresponding Risk of Injury Among 0- to 3-Year-Old Children in Child Safety Seats. Pediatrics, Vol. 121 No. 5, 2008. That appears to hold true regardless of age -- the middle rear seat is safest. The information from every fatal crash in the United States between
  2000 and 2003 was analyzed.... The data show that the rear middle seat
  is safer than any other occupant position when involved in a fatal
  crash. Overall, the rear (2(nd) row) seating positions have a 29.1%
  increased odds of survival over the first row seating positions ...
  occupants of the rear middle seat have a 13% increased chance of
  survival when involved in a crash with a fatality than occupants in
  other rear seats. Mayrose and Priya. The safest seat: effect of seating position
  on occupant mortality. Journal of Safety Research, Volume 39,
  Issue 4, 2008. Of course, if the car seat can't install in the center, then you have to choose a side. Crash statistics don't have much to say about this, but this UK site indicates that the passenger side would be preferred, since you're then taking the child in and out on the sidewalk side (rather than standing in the roadway) when parallel parked. It also indicates that middle is safer in the event of a crash, but does not mention crash risks when choosing between two sides. I will also note that whether or not it's true that drivers instinctively veer to protect themselves, that's only one type of potential crash. Head-on collisions are the most common, but you can be struck from anywhere -- and there isn't much that swerving can do to protect you from a side or rear impact. (Indeed, the numbers show that a driver-side impact is slightly more likely than a passenger-side impact...)  NHTSA crash statistics (for all collisions, not just injuries or fatalities) were averaged over multiple years to come up with the numbers. Data, and graphic, are from crashtest.com, found via the Internet Wayback Machine. Note that this is for the US, so driver is seated on the left side of the car."
Neighbor's child is trying to spend all her time with us,"You can't make anything clear to someone who doesn't respect your opinion. Explanations only matter if the person you're explaining to has kind of the same world view as you do. This is where boundaries come in. Clearly things are not ideal for this girl, and it's natural to want to be helpful, but in this situation, true helpfulness is often more than what is comfortable for the vast majority of people (I would think this would involve meeting the grandparents, getting social services involved to assist them with their needs and Angela's, cooking them occasional meals, etc. etc. Which is waaaay out of the comfort zones of most.) I agree that you should not have a minor in your house for any significant period of time without the knowledge and permission of the legal guardians, which gives you an excuse to meet the grandparents and assess the situation yourself. It also gives you a chance to have some kind of relationship with them before discussing concerns you might have should the need arise. Telling them about Angela's desire to spend time with you might prompt them to look into a Big Brother/Big Sister kind of program as well. It's time to be honest with Angela and yourselves and decide on and set up your boundaries. Reading about boundaries, what they are, and how to enforce them will help. If you only want to let Angela accompany you on dog walks, let her come along when you walk the dog. You can even let her know the day before what time you'll be walking the dog if you know that. If that's the extent of involvement you want to have, that's fine; it's your decision. If you want to give more, that's fine, too, but be consistent. If she comes to you at other times - when you're not available or you want to be alone together - just inform her politely. You don't have to explain or justify, you merely need to be kind, polite, and direct. Then close the door. If she continues to knock, I'd open the door and repeat once. Then stop answering the door. Will it hurt her? Yes, it probably will. Can you ease her pain by explaining she needs to spend more time with her friends? I don't think so. If being with her friends was meeting the precise needs she has, she would make that choice herself. It sounds like the truth is Angela needs much more than you want to give, but (and I don't mean to sound callous) Angela is not your responsibility, unless you want to and are willing to invest that kind of time and effort into her life. In an ideal world, every adult would respond to every child in need in an ideal manner. Probably a lot of people reading this feel that more should be done for the child, and the truth is, more should be done for the child, but it should be done by people who feel called to do so - by moral imperative, by profession, or by some other sense of or actual duty. It is a heart-rending situation without easy answers, or the OP would not have posted here. But moving into an apartment complex wherein there exists a needy teen (and we don't really know a lot more than that) does not constitute a definitive moral obligation to get involved in that needy teen's life. As someone with real-life experience with treating mental illness, I know that there are no easy answers. It is probably better to give a little bit with kindness, consistency, and real caring than more involvement with reluctance/resentment and ultimate withdrawal if the teen continues to push boundaries. The OP can take it from there."
"Just found out my 13 year old girl is Bi and dating a 17 year old girl in an ""open"" relationship. Huh? Now what?","The way these events unfolded is an unfortunate one, and I feel rather sorry for your current predicament as a family.  By forbidding your daughter from seeing her 17-year-old friend, it seems to me that you possibly accomplished several things: You showed your daughter that you fundamentally don't trust her judgment about herself and her own feelings You and/or your husband may have made her feel that despite your joint assurances regarding her possible homosexual orientation, you're unable to accept her as she is You destroyed a friendship with this girl that your daughter highly valued That same action also meant destroying your daughter's involvement in a Performing Arts class that she greatly enjoyed, and which had contributed substantially to her improved self-confidence.  You crystallized an asymmetrical definition of your daughter's relationship with her friend that might (or might not) have evolved into one on more equal terms. You also defined it as a fundamentally sexual relationship when its most important feature may have been the sense of friendship and guidance your daughter was getting from a somewhat more worldly-wise teenager who, from your description, was not actually intent on maliciously exploiting your daughter's inexperience. (I think your daughter would probably have been capable of dealing with the issue of her 17-year-old friend’s boyfriend on her own; or if not, I think it would have been better for you to let her come to you for advice rather than intervening the way you did) Because you have, until now, evidently had an open and affectionate relationship with your daughter, this sudden drastic interference on your part may have considerably shaken your daughter's confidence in your and your husband's perception of what is good for her, at least for the time being. You closed off an avenue for your daughter's exploration of her identity that was based on her own sense of her evolving personality rather than on parentally-imposed norms. (I think that by the age of 13, most children are ready to start gradually drawing away from their parents and defining who they want to be for themselves, with the benefit of supportive guidance from the parents rather than having the law laid down for them; but I know that this can be a tricky balance to strike.) Well, it is of course quite possible that I've missed the mark in some of my analysis. (There are a couple of points I would have liked a little clarification on: for instance, the wording of your description about how your husband was informed about your daughter's lesbian crush made me wonder if you are actually divorced and living in separate households, which would presumably make it more difficult to coordinate the way you handle some of the issues that are liable to arise in connection with your daughter’s upbringing.) Regardless, it does seem clear that there was a considerable failure (or several failures) of communication along the way. It seems important for healthy communication channels between all the members of your family to be reestablished as soon as is reasonably possible in order to restore a more normal atmosphere, and of course to improve the frayed relations between your daughter and yourselves. This may possibly involve giving her a sincere apology for breaching her trust or overreaching in your response to her relationship with her friend. (Showing that you can be fallible in your parental judgment when your daughter is 13 [and is probably savvier than one might suspect] would be the honest thing to do, and I'm sure she would appreciate the gesture of your openness if you can convince her that your action is genuine.) I also invite you to consider your own motivations for acting the way you did more deeply. Were they mostly about you and your prejudices, or were they truly mostly focused on your daughter's well-being? You do sound like a deeply caring parent, but it may be the case that you and your husband would benefit from at least a degree of professional help to come to terms with the possibility that your daughter will turn out to be gay, as well as getting some guidance regarding the best way to deal with some of the issues connected with that possibility. One thing you haven't discussed very much in your account is your daughter's relationship with her other friend (the one who is aged 13 or 14). I'm not sure what your attitude is towards that friendship, but unless some obvious red flags are apparent there, I'd be inclined to avoid doing anything that might give your daughter (who is currently very sensitive about the interference of her parents in her relationships with her peers) any additional cause for resentment. Apart from anything else, for as long as she is upset about your interference in her relationships with her friends, her ability to concentrate on her schoolwork is likely to be at least somewhat impaired. One of the other people who responded to your question raised the issue of the age of consent. I’m assuming you are based in the USA, in which case you might like to check out Wikipedia’s page concerning the age of consent in whichever of the 50 states you reside in: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ages_of_consent_in_North_America I hope my comments have been at least somewhat useful. Good luck!"
What should we do when our 15 year old wants sex with his 13 year old girlfriend?,"You have probably noticed that your can't control your son's actions by force or persuasion anymore, if you ever could. He's old enough now to be self directed, which is scary. The only thing you can do is to give him a moral framework in which to live. Can you explain to yourself why you think this is wrong? Is it purely because he could get into trouble with the law? Is it because of your religious convictions? Is it because you're worried he or his girlfriend might get hurt? Teenagers typically have a fairly high tolerance for risk and warning him about heartache or legal consequences is unlikely to have an effect. You need to show him how to act, but more importantly explain why he should act in that way. You can't prevent him from acting by force or threats any more. He will make his own decisions now and there's little you can do to prevent that, so give him the information he needs to make the right choice.  After that all you can do is trust him. That's a pretty scary thing. Best of luck."
"My parents are taking over my life, I think I'm going insane","This is actually a pretty common problem. Basically, it boils down to you starting to stand on your own but your parents not liking some of the decisions you've made. They feel that you still need their guidance and protection and you feel that you don't. It's a struggle that pretty much everyone goes through at some point. Everyone's situation is different, though. Ultimately, your parents likely want you to prove that you can be a mature and responsible adult. They don't think you're capable of it right now, which is why they're smothering you with all this protection. If you want your freedom without burning any bridges, you need to prove them wrong by showing them that you can be mature and responsible.  Aside from the family counselling that others have suggested, the best piece of advice I can give you is to get a job. I know it sounds cliche but I think it's exactly what you need. Not only is a job the kind of responsibility your parents are looking for and the kind of thing that prepares you for the future... yada yada yada... but it also provides you with a place where you can get away from home, make friends your parents might actually let you hang out with and chat/gossip/complain about life with people your own age without your parents around. These are all things that are important to maintain your emotional health and because it's a workplace environment, your parents aren't likely to deny it to you.  Personally, I went with pizza delivery guy when I was in high school. It gave me a valid reason why I needed my driver's license as well as regular driving practice. Between deliveries, I would do dishes and prep work with a couple other kids my age, creating friendships that I wouldn't have otherwise had. In fact, one of them became my roommate after graduation, making it easier for me to get out of my parents' house right after high school. I also lucked out in that my bosses were super nice and acted as sort of stand-in parents. I was able to talk to them about life stuff that I didn't feel comfortable talking to my own parents about and they gave me some pretty sound advice. Not all bosses will be like that but if you can find one who is, I think it would help tremendously. And if nothing else, the money you earn can be saved so that you can move out as soon as you graduate."
How to work-at-home given no daycare,"My husband and I work at home and have a two year old. We Have found the following to work really well for us.  Setup a safe play area. We have a play area right by our office that is completely childproof and as large as we can make it in the space. Our daughter is happy to play here by herself. Depending on the day it can be between 30 min or 1.5 hours (if we're lucky). I rotate the toys out often so that the old toys get some time too, and that seems to help a lot. I set up activities for her, give her books to look at, she loves building with blocks, and she generally wreaks havoc in the space. We talk to her while we work, sing songs and ask her about what she's doing. Since we're around, she is happy to do her own thing. Take advantage of naptimes We do naptime around lunchtime, from 12-2, and this time she is in her bed, playing quietly or sleeping. She doesn't have to sleep but she must be in her bed and quiet. This is when we work on tasks that need concentration and dedicated attention. Get them outside Usually in the morning we go for a walk before breakfast, and then in the late afternoon we play in the garden with her before suppertime. This helps get out the cooped-up time she spends inside, and she usually runs around and wreaks havoc in the garden. Work in shifts I usually work in the mornings and at naptime, and my husband works afternoons/evenings. This way there is a parent around to help/feed/water/entertain/change her, and the other parent can get a good chunk of work-time in.  Have low expectations There will be days when you just can't get everything done. Expecting both of you to work full time is just going to be impossible. My husband and I work probably 60 hours between us (him 35, me 25) and really beyond that is just not feasible. You may need to re-consider how much work you will be able to get done.  Drop the unnecessary balls Not everyone can juggle all the balls in the air. The dishes will be neglected, the laundry will too. Its ok. Do what you can to survive. We use the weekends to catch up on housework. Don't feel guilty If your kids are happy to play by themselves (in a safe place, with you nearby working), don't feel guilty! They need time to play alone independently and entertain themselves. It is a skill they need to learn. Appreciate it! because they will let you know when they need attention. But a little time on their own is fine, as long as they are safe and you are nearby. Take Time to Connect We have key times we check in and connect with our daughter. before naptime and before bed are the big ones, we spend some time giving her undivided attention. Reading, singing a song, playing, bathing, etc. We also spend a few min playing outside and exploring. This way we connect with her and keep her love tank full. "
How can I undo the bad behavior my 2.5 year old daughter learned from 5 year old children?,"For your first question: no, and no.  Don't cut off other parents, and don't micromanage things.   For your second question: yes, and yes.  You can educate her; that's what her life is at this point after all, a long education session. Your daughter is going to have many moments like this through her life, where she sees others and picks up behaviors. That's part of socialization.  This is a learning experience for her, and you should treat it as such. Don't focus at all on the fact that she picked it up from the other girls. The why is not important, the what is. Point out to her how it makes other people feel when she does these things. Show some sadness when she kicks you. Show her the other kids' emotions when she does something to another kid. You can use the experience with the other kids to show her how she feels.  Assuming the other kids push her also, you can remind her how she felt when she was pushed, or her toy taken.   But don't micromanage her during these interactions - that's a good way to keep her from learning. Let her have the experiences, and let her learn naturally, while giving her feedback when she acts out separately from this.  She won't be a perfect angel at 2 and a half; she'll have troubles like this as she grows.  It's entirely possible this experience is totally unrelated to the other girls, in fact; it's very common around this age to start asserting self-identity, and perhaps this was a trigger, but overall it's something that's to be expected. Your role is to help her learn for herself why this is a problem; and it's much better to learn this at 2.5 than at 12 or 15, when she's much less in your sphere of influence and hurting other children in much more serious ways, emotionally if not physically."
What is a positive way to handle a boy who acts like a girl?,"I did a small amount of research into this. According to one theory, children at the age of 3 haven't solidified the idea of gender permanence, that they are one sex and remain that sex even if they wear different clothes, etc. A three-year old boy may understand that he is a boy, but not necessarily have internalized that he is always a boy and will remain male forever.  I'm not getting into issues of later gender identity here, obviously, there are people who never feel comfortable as males or females and feel the need to change sex later in life. This is atypical, whereas having a flexible sense of gender in early childhood is quite typical. Most of the articles I read point to the ages between 3-6 as a time when gender identity becomes solidified. That is, at age 3 there is a sense that gender is flexible, but by age six most children have locked into a gender identity. So I think that for your 3 year old, there isn't any cause for concern at this time. His behavior is not particularly unusual, and it's too early to come to any conclusions about his sexuality or gender identity.  Anecdotally, after I read ""The Trumpet of the Swan"" to my son (who was about three at the time) he pretended to be a mommy swan for several weeks. He would pretend to build nests and sit on eggs, waiting for them to hatch. He's spent time caring for his sisters dolls. He loves baseball. In other words, he's just a kid, and his games reflect what he is thinking and learning about more than anything else."
Why does my infant wake crying the instant we put him in his bed?,"You didn't specify how you put him to bed, so here are a few suggestions. I think the infant will feel abandoned if you just put him down without a word, and then simply remove your hands, and then leave the room. I don't imply that you do, but it's a contrast. Have you tried to:   I've also learned that sleeping children are very sensitive to their inner gyroscope. Rotations along the lengthwise axis (head to feet) are agreeable, but rotations across that axis (from vertical at your shoulder to horizontal in your arms/on the bed) is not agreeable. So make such rotations slowly."
"How should a stepfather respond to ""You are not my Father!""?","I was brought up by a stepdad, and yes, ""You are not my real dad"" is an ""ultimate defense"" used to hurt, and only to hurt, when you feel wronged, and you feel you have no more arguments left to why you should not be allowed to do something/forced to do something. It's the equivalent of saying ""You are stupid"". He will not change his mind about how he feels for you, or maybe he will, and that's okay. Don't be hurt by his words. Admit that he is correct in that ""you aren't his real dad"". Reaffirm that not being his biological father is not important to you because you still care about him. You are forbidding him to [smoke, drink, whatever] because you care."
How can I be more sympathetic towards my children when they are injured?,"I do not like my behavior. Parenting is difficult at every stage for somewhat different reasons. Children aren't miniature adults, especially at your child's age. They don't think or process like adults; they don't have a long period of time to learn 'the consequences' of simple behaviors like adults. Even some adults haven't learned yet to accept the consequences of their own actions (ever see anyone argue with a speeding ticket?) Your particular behavior shows that rational thinking is much more comfortable to you than empathy. For anyone in any kind of pain, however, the opposite is true. They need empathy first, and rational thinking later - much later. You might not be comfortable with empathy first, but you can choose to change your behavior. The more you practice it, the more comfortable and happy you will be using it. Positive responses from those in pain will be rewarding, as opposed to the cold shoulder you now experience. How do I be more sympathetic towards my children's pain? Drop the ""I"" from your response.  If you're tempted to use ""I"", it should only be followed by ""...am so sorry you're hurting"". Stop there. This isn't about you, how you feel about what happened (powerless), about teaching the laws of gravity or Murphy's law. It's about your child's (or, indeed, anyone's) pain, physical or emotional. So, number 1 for you is no ""I"" (or ""me"") statements.  Don't blame the victim for their pain. The opposite of comfort to someone in pain is the statement, ""If you had listened to me, you wouldn't be hurting right now."" It adds an element of insult to injury, even if it's true. Even if it's true, it is not an empathetic response. Pain requests empathy, not blame. Before saying a word, imagine your child's pain were your own. It's hard to see your child in pain, and the number of times it is a direct result of not listening to you are and will be innumerable. It's less comfortable to experience the child's pain than to rationalize it. But live with it. Being a parent (or a person in relationship to anyone else) means living with the hurt of others. If you do that, a response to the above situation might look more like, ""Ouch/Oh my goodness! Here, let me see. [Honey/Sweetie/whatever the affectionate nick-name], do you want some ice on that? (In other words, I feel it with you. How can I help?)  Practice, practice, practice. This will not be easy for you, nor will it be comfortable. But as a parent it's part of your job to raise children who feel valued. You'll make mistakes; if you catch yourself in one, start over. ""I'm sorry, let me start again..."" sounds trite, but it's not. It allows for practice even when you flub up. It acknowledges that your first response was the wrong one. It helps. Pick your teachable moments, and separate them from the event by at least 30 sentences. Yes, that's a crazy, random number. But it means you'll not have insulted the child for a while, and will keep you in an empathetic mode. When the child has first experienced a significant degree of empathy from you, then they can hear the life lesson. It might even give you time to realize that the life lesson isn't what you think it is. Read about how to develop empathy. This is just a start. Reading about the hows and whys will help you understand your response and how it differs from the ideal. There's a fascinating case of a neuroscientist doing a study an imaging study of sociopaths (people unable to feel empathy) who, while reading MRIs of the groups, realized that his own MRI revealed defects indicating he was a sociopath. He set about speaking to his family and colleagues  about his actions, etc. and realized that yes, he was a high-functioning sociopath. Buy he studied empathic responses and became a better husband, father, and human being. He still was not naturally empathetic, but his relationships improved."
How to help a bullied child (without involving parents or teachers),"I have been the bullied child. What my parents tried to teach me was being able to stand up for myself. Trusting in my self-worth and independence. A parent can help with the first steps on this way, but in the end the child has to develop this mostly on his own. It will take a long time. You can help him find good responses to bullies which are not rude, but might help outwit and thus win over them. Also, provide a safe haven. There is only so much bullying a child can take. I had days where I did not want to go to school and still I had to, but very infrequently (in fact as far as I remember only once or twice) I was feeling so bad that my parents allowed me to stay home and just get a break. Tell them that they are not weak. Often bullying stems from envy. It makes you feel bad about being smart or quick and observant and only see the bad facts about you. Make them aware of their good traits (and yes, also how being a bully is not a good trait, so those other kids definitely have bad traits, too). Find out how to build their strength. What is making them feel strong? Are there situations where they stand up for themselves or others? What is it in that situation that made them able to do it? Remind them of those situations. Do not send them back to ""stand up for themselves"" when they come home crying. Now they are weak and hurt and it would only get worse. Send them off to be strong when they leave to play with their bullies in the first place.  In the end, my parents did what they could. I don't know how, but at some point I learned how to treat bullies in a way that I was not a good victim for them any more. I think I learned it by being able to stand up for and protect others. Then I realised I can do this for myself, too. What will help your child in detail depends a lot on their character and interests. But maybe this is a start. Teach them they are not a victim. Emphasise their strengths. Be a shoulder to cry on. Provide a safe heaven, but do not go out and solve their problems. Do not force them to interact with their bullies. (You do not have to love all people. But you can also avoid those who are not worth it, instead of hating them.)"
My kids watch YouTube - how do I control what they see?,"Watch YouTube with your child, then you will know what they are watching. A toddler can wander onto something by accident and see something they cannot un-see.   Do not let your toddler wander the Internet alone, it is a very dangerous place. There are no safeguards that are 100% effective at blocking adult material on the Internet, except adult supervision! Some software exists to alleviate some Internet dangers, but there is still no substitute for sitting with your child and watching what they are watching and knowing what they are doing.  By doing this you are guiding them and teaching them good Internet habits, and as they get older you will not have to watch them so closely because you know the habits that you have instilled in them."
Should I try to long-distance parent or will I do more harm than good?,"I don't think you can ""parent"" in the sense of applying discipline and strong guidance. But you can be in his life. My mother had a god-daughter on a different continent. From the time the god-daughter was a young child, my mother would write to her regularly. She always remembered birthdays and Christmas. She probably only visited a few times as the girl grew up, but she had an impact on her life. The god-daughter certainly knew that this was a person who cared about her and mattered. There is still a bond there (god-daughter in her 30's now). You could do something like that and I'm sure it would be effective. Writing is good, because it doesn't put the child on the spot for a reply. It's being faithful and persistent that matters -- not having tons of things to say.  When your son is older, he might want to visit with you, and he would know that you are someone he can turn to -- that there is a relationship there that matters to both of you. There will come a time when he will want to know the other half of his parentage, and he'll know he can reach out if there has always been communication. It won't be the same as being an ""on-site Dad"", but it will be special in its own way."
Should I be restrictive in my son's interest in electricity?,"I'm no parent, but an electrical engineer. So I will focus mainly on the safety aspects, and on how to push him towards safer branches of electronics. I think encouraging his interest in electronics is a good idea (plenty of work opportunities for later). However, except in presence of a competent mentor, at his age, I would strongly advise you to forbid the most dangerous parts of electronics. My suggestion would be: With those limits, the risk is very limited. Globally, approaching any device powered from mains that is not in an enclosure is to be avoided whenever possible. Doing any tests directly on it requires special training (in France, it's 3 full days of training), and even then is supposed to be done only if it can't be avoided (and then with heavy protective equipment). Working under voltage (other than measurements) requires a 2 weeks training (and there are only 2 training centers in the whole country) For voltages above 1500V, the restrictions are still far more drastic, and even most electrical engineers/technicians (me included) are not allowed to work with such voltages. Those voltages include new risks, including arcing (ie you can get electrocuted without even touching the wires) If don't already have one, I would consider buying him a lab power supply (usually those are 2 channels, each up to 30V and 3A), which gives him more than enough power for nearly all ""reasonable"" circuits he might want to do, while integrating advanced protections (including current limiting, and therefore being able to resist short circuits without problems). I would then try to orient him towards designing his own (low power) circuits instead of copying circuits from the internet: he will likely learn more.
You can help him by finding ideas (if you lack ideas, ask on some electronics forums), for example making a traffic light (either just one, or the whole crossing), making an alarm that goes on if you open a box without pressing the correct combination of keys at the same time, making a little robot always steering towards the light, and so on. From what you wrote, he seems to mainly be scavenging parts from broken equipment. It might help to steer him in this direction to buy him some parts for low power circuits (those are often difficult to find in recent equipment, as they are often too small to unsolder). You might even make a deal out of it: you buy him some parts he wants (for a given budget) in exchange of him stopping with high voltage/mains. If he is interested (and he speaks English, otherwise it's a bit harder), it might also be interesting to get him an Arduino kit: the Arduino is a small device that can be programmed, and therefore allows many projects, and teaches him programming); the kits usually include plenty of sensors, actuators and other components To summarize, I would do everything possible to encourage his interest in low power electronics (forbidding anything high voltage without a mentor). For finding a mentor if you/he wants one, I would suggest looking at: If you can't find one, then maybe go for some books (I would suggest getting an extensive and advanced kit, with a good instruction manual. This way, he has both the instructions and the hardware to build with, and it's far less likely than on the internet that he will find anything dangerous in there.)"
"How do you respond to a toddler who endlessly says ""why?""?","I'm probably going to experience this situation pretty soon, too. One very interesting idea I've picked up a long time ago is not to accept a short ""why"" but encourage a full-sentence question.  Requiring a full sentence forces the child to actually think about the topic before asking.
What is the topic? What do I want to know? How can I phrase that?
This is excellent training for thinking smartly about things later in life, and it clearly shows that more effort in the input yields better results. It also has two immediate wins for you: Your challenge is to be consistent about this... why should you get to choose when a short ""why"" is acceptable? If you're too lazy to enforce the full sentence, then you can't expect the effort on his part either."
"My toddler calls me ""Mommy"", but I'm his father","My son (similar age) calls both me and his mum ""Daddy"". He also has a habit of calling all animals Cows or Sheep. Like Erica says in the comment, it's pretty standard. They've learnt a single word which at the moment means ""Parent/Adult/Someone that's not Me"". As they learn more words they can elaborate on the distinction. Just reinforce the difference patiently (""No, I'm your daddy! That's your mommy"", while smiling) and he'll get there eventually! The best example I've ever seen was my nephew, who had learnt that his Grandparents' Dog's name was Pippa. He then called every dog Pippa. When he was told that a particular dog was not Pippa (""That's not Pippa, that's Rufus!"", for instance), he would then call the other dog ""Not-Pippa""."
How can I help my child who is advanced in programming to meet others at the same skill level?,"I meet people at local meetups. Where I live there are about three Python meetups a month.  My experiences have been great: excellent programmers who just like to talk shop. While you will likely meet others at your skill level, you won't meet people at your age level. It will mostly be older people (e.g. college age or higher), but if the goal is to talk shop in person, that's your best bet. Obligatory caveat: exercise caution and go with a parent, at least at first. If there isn't a local meetup, you could start one on general programming or something. Another option, if the goal is to talk shop, not meet similar-aged peers, is to find and take a local college course."
My child wants GTA V for his birthday,"You say that you don't want him to play it -- that's your answer, you should not buy it for him. Parents set the rules. Explaining why you aren't buying it can help him accept this decision more gracefully. It's an adult-rated game and he isn't (nearly!) old enough, you disagree with the content and lifestyle that it's portraying, you're concerned he will think that behavior is acceptable and start imitating it... have a conversation about the game's problems and your reasons, but simultaneously make it clear this isn't a negotiation. If you're searching for an appropriate game for his birthday, look for other games with similar play but less graphic plot. It's likely he would be far more interested in the fast car driving (and maybe even crashes and explosions) than in the gangs, murders, prostitutes, and plot-based aspects of the game. And there are plenty of crashy, explody car racing games that don't build a story around criminality, instead focusing on the cars. At ten years old, most games PEGI 12 are probably acceptable; you can also use sites like Common Sense Media to help understand the details of what content earned it that rating. The summary of the GTA V rating, for example: Parents need to know that Grand Theft Auto V is an M-rated action game
  brimming with gang violence, nudity, extremely coarse language, and
  drug and alcohol abuse. It isn't a game for kids. Playing as hardened
  criminals, players kill not only fellow gangsters but also police
  officers and innocent civilians using both weapons and vehicles while
  conducting premeditated crimes, including a particularly disturbing
  scene involving torture. Women are frequently depicted as sexual
  objects, with a strip club mini-game allowing players to fondle
  strippers' bodies, which are nude from the waist up. Players also have
  the opportunity to make their avatars use marijuana and drink alcohol,
  both of which impact their perception of the world. None of the main
  characters in the game makes for a decent role model. All of them are
  criminals who think of themselves first and others rarely at all. Few
  games are more clearly targeted to an adult audience."
How can I teach a teenager to plan better and procrastinate less in his studies?,"Sounds like a common problem for gifted children: they finally reach a level  where sitting back and coasting isn't enough, and having to actually put in some effort comes as a serious shock. Often the more gifted the child the worse this is, because greater talents merely put off the evil day and the resulting flameout is all the worse. At least this is happening at school and not when he is away at college. It might help to explain this to TB. Understanding a situation often makes it easier to cope with. It might also help to understand that ""this is what its been like for your classmates all along"". Apart from that, I'd say you are on the right track. Firm about what needs to be done, understanding about the challenge, and rewards and approval for success."
How should a jobless father advise his son when he refuses to study because of his educated jobless dad?,"First and foremost, that logic is not sound.  The argument boils down to ""bad things happen no matter what, so why should I try?""   To give an analogous example, I can take meticulous care of my car and it could run for 10+ years.  But all that care will not put a magic ward around my car to protect it from a storm causing a flood or knocking a tree on to it.  By your son's logic, I shouldn't even bother taking care of the car.  And I would expect that car to be a broken down wreck after a couple of years.  But guess what?  By taking good care of my cars I have had most last 10+ years.  I've also lost some to having an idiot driver blow a stop light and cream my car.  But that doesn't stop me from taking care of my cars.  Because I am far more likely to achieve success (being defined in this case as keeping a car running for a long time) by taking steps towards making that happen than by relying on the universe's sense of chaos and justice to benevolently grant me long running car. I know this sounds cliche, but it applies here anyway.  Success is not measured by how many times we fall, but by how many times we pick ourselves back up.  The father in your story has a college degree and a history of hard work.  Those are tools he can use to pick himself back up and get going again.  Without those, it would be far harder to get a new job. Sure, there are stories of college drop-out millionaires and of people who studied and worked hard all their lives and are destitute.  But those are the statistical outliers.  Most people who study and work hard end up doing ok in the long run.  (Looking at the long term here is key as well.  Short term, the father here is not doing well.  Long term I'm sure he will be fine.) Also, not studying or working hard just restricts the opportunities your son could have later in life.  Those things don't guarantee success, but failing to do them can lead to certain failure depending on the pursuit.  (If you want to work at some place like NASA, you better have a college degree or it just ain't happening.)  Most people will never rival Jimi Hendrix as a guitar player.  Those who never bother to try learning to play a guitar certainly never will. Study and hard work don't make you immune to problems.  They better prepare you to deal with problems.  Since everyone is going to have problems in life, why would you want to make it harder for yourself by trading some play time now for a world of pain later?"
Should I encourage/persuade my 3 year old to watch kids TV shows that she finds scary or upsetting?,"First of all, let me assure you that I understand your worry. I have been in your situation three years ago and it can be very alarming when your child finds ""Ben and Holly"" too scary (""The bird stole her wand! Waa-waa-waa! Turn it off now!""), doesn't listen to any kids stories (""Red-riding hood"" was considered a horror movie) and doesn't allow any evil characters in a role-play games. It limits a lot their exposure to literature, theater and possible game plots. It seems to slow down their emotional development. I would like to tell you what we did and how it worked out.  Turn off when she asks. Otherwise she might not trust you when you try to show her something new.  Try different shows. Sometimes the plot would be so interesting that curiosity will beat fear. In our case she started to watch Princess Sofia earlier than she agreed to Luntik (I am not sure you know this one, but it is aimed at age 2-3). Skip scary parts and then accidentally show some glimpses of them once she is used to the story. This how we watched Tinkerbell. Ask if it's okay if you watch it yourself and she will play in the other room meanwhile. My daughter would say okay and then peek across the room to find out what's next. Find an environment where she is exposed to it together with other children. We have a wonderful interactive puppet theater where we watched many traditional fairy tales. She seemed scared but everybody else around were laughing so she decided that this is not that scary after all. Siblings help a lot. I remember that a major progress happened when her older cousin came to visit for three weeks. She would organize all type of normal children games (with evil witches, dying, resurrection, volcanoes, doctors etc.) My daughter really wanted to join it and was very fast to accept these scary things as norm than she would ever do with me. I was asking the same question as yours myself and I tried to find answer from other people who worked with my daughter, like preschool and school teachers. There was very little they could say apart from ""all children are different, yes, maybe her reaction is strange but she is a normal child"".  I decided not to think about it as a disorder and our doctor advised against going to a psychologist about this issue (but if you are very worried ask them as well).  Finally, my  solution is: don't push her to it but also don't tip-toe around her preferences. I think accepting her ""no""s unconditionally is impractical because she will be exposed to these kind of things at school and preschool anyway. From our experience, I can tell you that it  gradually fades away, you are not stuck with Peppa Pig and silly chooh-chooh trains forever=). But it also does so in strange speed for different aspects. Funny note, she is six now and she read two first Harry Potters. Voldemort, spiders, forbidden forest were scary, but bearable. However, the moment where Harry was sent to the Headmaster  triggered a complete meltdown and she didn't touch the book for two weeks =)."
What's the motivation behind school uniforms {or} Why can't my daughter wear a dang princess on her shirt? [closed],"I wore a school uniform (very similar to what you describe) from ages 10 - 17. There were some benefits to it such as not having to waste time figuring out what to wear and not feeling ""judged"" by my choice of outfit.  You seem concerned your 5 yro won't be able to express their individuality. I'd like to argue that uniforms could do the opposite.  Uniforms encourage you to express your individuality beyond your physical appearance. Since everyone looks the ""same"" you have to stand out some other way. You learn to be more expressive with your personality and what you say than with your t-shirt. Accessories became important as well. There is still the desire to look different so bold earrings, headbands, jewelry, shoes, etc. are great.  I am no parent but just a thought, is it easier getting younger children dressed when you only have a few simple options to choose from? Edit: @Tracey Cramer made the comment below, ""How you wear the uniform (sloppy, neat), how you accessorize the uniform, how you perform in class is how you express your uniqueness"". I really liked this statement and felt it deserved more recognition than just a comment. "
Should I stop my mother in law visiting when she doesn't respect me as the father figure?,"I can't see that it's healthy for the kids. I absolutely agree.  This is a major problem, as your kids need to look up to you as an authority figure, and that will be very difficult if she's constantly undercutting your authority. Is this simply my total lack of understanding of what grandparents are for (as mine were distant to say the least) or what? It is not at all uncommon (in my limited experience) for grandparents (or even total strangers!) to try to step into roles that really belong to you and your wife, exclusively.  There is always a risk that anyone who considers themselves an ""experienced"" parent might decide that it is appropriate to step in when they feel you're doing it ""wrong"" (note that ""wrong"" in this case is almost always just ""not exactly the same way I'd do it"", which is by no means actually wrong). No matter what the relationship, this is never appropriate (with the sole exception of if they honestly believe that harmful negligence or abuse is occurring). I don't want to whine to my wife as she shouldn't be in the middle of this. Here's where I disagree with you. Your wife needs to be involved in this.  Not only is she your children's mother, it is also her mother that is causing the problem.  At the very least, she needs to be on board with, and supportive of, any action you take regarding interactions with your mother-in-law. Talk to your wife. Try to have the talk when there is some time before your mother-in-law's next visit (hopefully she isn't coming by every week!).  This will give your wife time to process it, and to have further discussions with you. Start by focusing on how you feel, rather than complaining about what your mother is doing (e.g. ""I feel like I'm not allowed to be the father, if every time I say something I get overruled"" instead of ""she keeps undermining my authority, and she coddles the kids whenever I try to set rules""). If (when) your wife comments on how she wasn't aware that some of this was going on, you can explain that you've talked about it directly with your MIL, and that your MIL acknowledged to you that she doesn't always tell your wife the truth.  Then point out that this has been going on for a long time, but that you've been reluctant to bring it up with her out of concern that it would put your wife in the middle, and create a ""he said, she said"" situation. Come up with a clear plan with your wife.  I'd suggest that, rather than banning your MIL from coming over, you propose that the three of you sit down and talk together.  You and your wife should come up with clear rules that you'd like to propose (such as that if you tell your kids that they can't do something, or hand out a punishment, your mother in law is not allowed to overrule you; or ""no shouting allowed""). Once you've established your ground rules, the three of you should sit down, and discuss them.  Don't bring up any past behavior.  Just start the discussion by saying that you want to ensure that the children have the best upbringing possible, and that you'd appreciate your MIL's help by cooperating with some basic ground rules.  Point out up front that you and your wife came up with these rules together, and have put serious thought into them. If the discussion goes poorly, then at least your wife will have been a direct witness to the problem (so remember to stay calm; every bit of bad behavior from your MIL during this meeting only makes your position stronger!), and the two of you can follow up privately to discuss how you want to proceed (which may involve stricter restrictions, such as ensuring that your MIL can only be over when your wife is present). Good luck!"
Should I really be insisting that my daughter finish eating her meal?,"A slightly more scientific perspective. A study done called 'You Will Eat All of That! (A retrospective analysis of forced consumption episodes)' found that pressuring children into finishing their food may lower their natural appetite (perhaps because they're being told when and how much to eat, rather than learning naturally). Other studies have also found that it may lead to over-eating in adulthood (as you may be encouraging them to eat after they've stopped being hungry), and that it may actually inhibit their growth. You might also find it helpful to know that another study named ''Finish your soup’: Counterproductive effects of pressuring children to eat on intake and affect' found that in children who were pressured into eating certain foods (e.g. vegetables), those children were more likely to gain an aversion to those foods that lasted into adulthood. This blog post  has an overview on the topic, but he's an excerpt from the end: (emphasis added by me) As a parent, you naturally feel anxious if your child is doing
  something that you think is unhealthy, like not eating ""enough.""
  Reassure yourself that in all but the rarest of cases, children will
  eat enough food to survive and be healthy. Notice the times when you feel tempted to pressure your child to eat.
  Relax, take a deep breath, smile, and say to yourself ""Oh well. His
  brain knows how much he needs to eat."" Then go do something else to
  distract yourself.
  The following behaviors are perfectly normal! Don't get scared into
  pressuring your child to eat when he does them. To get your child to eat at mealtimes, try these techniques: You might also want to consider why you are pressuring your child to finish. Did her supper take a lot of work, and perhaps you don't want to see it wasted? Perhaps you should prepare lighter suppers in the future. Are you worried that they will snack later? Why not buy some healthy snacks, like apples, breakfast bars, or healthy crisps. Or, if you're worried about a snacking habit developing, perhaps you need to move around your dinner times a bit to suit your child's appetite? Try to consider these things from your child's perspective, and remember they aren't intentionally trying to waste food or annoy you. Best of luck!"
How important should the color of a bike be to a 7-year-old girl?,"Seems to me that the true question is, How do I teach my child to weigh the value of the color of a bike versus the quality of the bike (and perhaps price?). As such, I think this is a great learning moment for your daughter.  Either sit down in front of a computer with an appropriate web shop pulled up, or go to the bike store, and select several different options.  Talk over the advantages and disadvantages of each one. If one is less expensive, for example, point out that you would then have some money left over to have a nice meal out, or buy a book, or whatnot.  If one has better build quality, point out that it won't break as quickly. Second, point out that she can accessorize the bike however she wants once the bike itself is purchased.  Talk about her options for doing so - not sure I'd paint it, but certainly streamers, beads in the wheels, a new seat (seats are entirely changeable on most bikes), new pedals if the bike has replaceable pedals - all are options, either right away or once she's saved up some money to do so. Then, ultimately, I would let her make her own decision.  Get her to talk to you intelligently about it, but once she's done so, get the bike she prefers.  Then, if it turns out the bike she chose isn't as good, she'll learn that she made a choice, and lives with the consequences of it - in this case, a bike that is harder to ride or doesn't go as fast or breaks more quickly. Because ultimately, the question you asked - 'How important should the color of a bike be for a seven year old girl' - has no real answer other than what she feels."
"As an atheist, how should I explain theism to my children?","As an atheist, how should I explain theism to my children? Treat all religions the same way: explain that they exist, and that you don't believe in them, but you do believe that everybody should make up his own mind on what to believe / believe in. As a non-believer, this can be hard to pull off without sounding dismissive toward the concept of religion as a whole. As a personal example, I'm strongly atheistic but mildly curious about Buddhism and Shintoism (for their peaceful history) while also having strong opinions against Christian and Muslim varieties (less peaceful track record), but I keep all this to myself unless asked. I'm sure I can't provide an unbiased explanation to my son. How can I protect my children from religious indoctrination, while not pushing my views on them? I don't think you can avoid some degree of indoctrination, regardless whether it's for or against. Whatever stance you choose, that is the view you're ""indoctrinating"" them with...   If you provide the texts and mythologies as literary works and not (as they're originally intended) as works of religious fact then you're already saying that religion is mere fantasy. I'm not judging whether that's right or wrong - I'm trying to say that you can't not pick a side.  If you just manage to get across that you do believe that everybody should make up his own mind, then you I think can't do much better. This related question and its answers might have some useful bits for you (please ignore the noise in comments). Update: You might want to browse through Dale's blog here: The Meming of Life - it deals with wise but everyday insights by a parent who wants to raise his children with a thorough understanding of religion, but with the emphasis that religion is not ""true"". There's lots of wise stuff in there, but the most impressive thing is that Dale knows a lot about religion -- when you've got your facts and references straight, you can argue much better."
Do parents get punishment too?,"As parents we start by modelling behaviour for our children. Show by your good example what you as a family do and how you act and react when a wilful or unwillful mistake is made. Discipline should never be so harsh that a child fears admitting the truth or coming to you for help with a problem. Okay when a parent breaks their child's trust by overreacting to a problem or destroying property, or mistakenly disciplines one child for something they did not do or someone else did:  The above also applies to a parent if did do something illegal or unethical and the child discovered it --  but you are unlikely to have your apologies accepted. If a parent does something for which there is a known reaction/consequence -- did not complete or do a chore, took something (cookies), swore, had a tantrum: An accident is an accident. The consequences for an accident are usually natural.  Not doing laundry might be shared 'guilt'. A reminder before it was too late, might have been in order. Each member of a family is responsible (within reason and age being factored) to make the household work. If you must bake cupcakes for school, it makes sense for the child to remind Mum or Dad a few days in advance. If the football shirt or pants must be washed, they need to be in the right place and perhaps a reminder on Wednesday that the pants are required on Friday.   We have a chore board for the family and even before she could write, our daughter would ask for an item to be added to the list. We have a double check system -- we check the list leaving home in the mornings/at breakfast and returning home in the evenings or at dinner time. I have always had too many things on my plate to remember all the details, so a list is imperative. It would have to be willful on my part not to do something I had agreed to as long as I was capable of getting out of bed. All people make mistakes and errors. All of us are sometimes guilty of  knowingly breaking a rule -- speeding, incomplete stops, swearing at other drivers come easily to mind. If you tell your child that being law-abiding is important -- model it. If you don't, you are not being fair when you expect children to follow rules when you plainly do not. You have to be conscientious of consequences when you do things in front of your children. Teach your children to take responsibility by taking it yourselves."
How should I inform parents if their children are bothering me?,"Is it acceptable for me to tell a parent that the noises their children make are bothering me?  Sure, just as acceptable as it would be for you to ask a fellow passenger to get off their phone or stop swaying to the music in their earphones. It's not against the law to request another person stop acting in a way that bothers you. There's lots of people who go around telling others how to live their life in public, and about the only consequence is generally glares or refusal to follow the advice or request. what is the best way to inform them without making the situation worse?  There's no ideal way to tell someone that you want them to behave differently, but if you've reached the point where you feel compelled to do so, the best way is to simply ask them.   ""Will you please ask your child to be a little quieter?"" In some cultures you can deflect some of the irritation they will feel by apologizing: ""I'm sorry to ask, but will you please help your child to be a little more quiet?"" If you do have a valid medical complaint, some will respond favorably to a plea: ""I hate to ask, but I have a head injury/mental illness/etc that is exacerbated by high pitched sounds. Your child is making very repetitive high pitched sounds, and I was hoping you might be able to find a way to quiet them a little."" In some areas, requests can be softened by complements: ""You have such a lovely child! I hate to be a bother, but I'm trying to concentrate on this report, and it would be very helpful if your child was a little more quiet."" If you want to avoid offending them, you should consider the following:"
Why does my daughter smile and start to laugh at me when I am noticeably really angry at her?,"And then when I start to look noticeably angry and start to raise my voice, she laughs at me. I have Asperger's, and this is something I have dealt with all my life. I initially noticed this when I was young: I would find myself involuntarily laughing when in situations where I was either subjected to physical pain (such as burns or blunt trauma), subjected to vocal outbursts, or was being accused of actions which I never took. But when you are at your most angry and someone just starts laughing at you, it really invokes a lot of restraint on anyone's part. I can't think of a worse thing to do to someone who is angry at you than to laugh at them. Unfortunately, the best action to take is to do your best to control your anger, realize that she doesn't actually mean to laugh at you, and help her understand that her reactions and provocations are not permissible. I must reiterate that, at least in my case, the response is involuntary, and I literally can't help it when it happens. However, with time and guidance, she will probably grow out of it. I know that this may not make a lot of sense. Why would someone laugh when they're being subjected to physical pain or being yelled at? I can affirm that it's a very strange sensation, almost as if the brain's response to pain and the brain's response to humor are linked together."
When should parents stop changing clothes in front of children?,"Seeing parents or other adults naked is entirely unconnected to abuse. See any reports on familial abuse (by far the most common type), and more anecdotally, see the lack of systemic abuse in naturist and nudist environments. I'd support Stephie's comment that naturists tend to be very proper about what is and isn't acceptable behaviour. Your culture may suggest that nakedness is somehow a bad thing. Mine suggests it is perfectly natural, and I would recommend that being unashamed about your body in front of your children helps to give them a healthy view of their own, whereas being ashamed, or associating nakedness with sex or improper behaviours can only help to propagate that view to your kids. Of course, as your kids get older they may well reach a point where they may not want to see you, ""Ewww - naked parents."" which is fine. "
My 4 year-old says she doesn't love her mom,"I think your instincts of jealousy are spot-on.  My daughter did this starting when her little brother arrived home from the hospital, and every time she felt like he was getting more of Mama's attention, out came the verbal knives.   Our fix was to schedule special one-on-one time with her when we could.  And when things were just too crazy to carve very much one-on-one time out, we included her in taking care of her little brother; when she felt more included (get his diapers, read a book to him, help one of us with a household chore) she was much happier and reverted less to the ""I don't love you, Mama"" pronouncements. In other words, I'm not a pediatrician or a psychologist, but our experience with a jealous elder child tracked closely to yours.  And the solution you are considering worked for us.  Give Mom an extra hug from this internet stranger; I remember how much it stung when my eldest would lash out with ""I don't love you!"" ETA:  @DavidBoshton reminded me: when my daughter would lash out (and I was past the postpartem nightmare of hormones), I would reply, ""That's okay.  I love you even if you don't love me.  I will never stop loving you.""  This also helps when she throws a tantrum even today (girlfriend gets hangry like no one's business)."
How does one formally educate a gifted child without wrecking childhood?,"In a related question, a user linked this article.  It might be relevant to your concerns about the social implications of home schooling. However, if your child enjoys his current school, then I would suggest simply adding in in-home supplemental education.   Allow your child to pick subjects (or suggest a list of possible subjects, if you'd like), and do a project on the chosen subject each evening after school.  If you feel your child needs more work on a given subject, you can specify that it be a mandatory topic for certain nights (""math Mondays"", ""History night"" on Tuesdays, etc.). Each project should be interesting, educational, and advanced enough to be challenging.  There's a wide range of possibilities for any given subject, from simple research ending with your child explaining what he learned to you (""...and that is how radios work!""), to experiments (""tonight we're going to start recreating Mendel's genetic experiments""), to applying knowledge to craft and hobby projects (some of the projects in this book, for example). The important goal for you is to make sure that learning things continues to be fun for your son.  It is hard to change a child's mind once they've decided that learning is ""boring"", and if your child is already finding his school work boring, it is likely to only get worse without intervention."
My son is 5 years old and sexually active,"You absolutely need to seek professional help. The fact that he is forcing other children to perform sexual activities indicates that this is a VERY serious problem that you need to address immediately. Try to find a psychologist, councilor, or social worker who specializes in working with children.  If they feel they aren't the right people to help you, at the very least they can provide you with referrals to help find the appropriate professional to help your son."
How to tell my parents I want to marry my girlfriend,"First up; your parents can protest and disallow it all they want, you're an adult and there is nothing they can really do to stop you from marrying whomever you want and living wherever you want. So if you're afraid your parents will say ""no,"" remember that their opinion of your marriage is, in the end, not an actual barrier. For the same reason, you don't need to tell them about your plans at all. The idea of asking for permission to marry someone in the Netherlands is pretty old-fashioned, and most people don't do it anymore. It seems you´re pretty set on this marriage, so at this point I would not bring it up as a ""I'm thinking about marrying this girl"", but as an ""I'm going to marry this girl"". That said, you should probably put some effort into trying to patch up the relationship between your parents and your partner. Try to find out what caused the initial social problems, and try to make both sides make an effort to get along better next time.  (And seriously; don't have someone over for a month and only ask how it was experienced at the end of it. You could've probably prevented all of this if you had talked to your parents about how they liked your partner a few days after she arrived, so you could've fixed the problem then.) Alternatively, if your partner really does not feel welcome, try to get your parents to travel with you. This has the nice added advantage that your in-laws can meet your family, which I feel is generally a good idea anyway. And try to address any language-issues where possible; you might need to translate between people from time to time. That's part of having a partner from a different country. It also has the advantage that people tend to be a little happier in general while on holiday, and less likely to cause issues in another's home. In the end, it's your life. Dutch society is generally pretty strong on ""it's your life, do with it what you want"", and most likely your parents will come around, even if it sours the mood at first. There's also a good chance that it is most important for them that you are happy, even if that means leaving for the USA.  There's also, of course, some chance that it really does ruin the relationship with your parents. At some point, you have to decide who is more important to you; that's a question nobody else can answer. But I've found that usually, parents get over the initial shock of their kids not doing what they expected of them and realize that they're still their kids and they still love them regardless."
My partner's pregnant with her second child (my first) and shows no emotions. How can I help bring that excitement out of her?,"Pregnancy and how it affects the mother is an intense stew of physical and hormonal changes. Each child may come with a different ""stew"" recipe.  Sounds like the father of her original child didn't stick around, so maybe there's some sub-conscious anxiety as this brings back memories and feelings that preceded that event/issue, as well. In any case, how she's feeling now may or may not have any carry over to how she feels once the child is born, so don't put too much weight into that. You can't make her more cheerful or peppy about it.  If she's struggling a bit more with the emotional side, all you can do is be there to offer whatever support she needs, and quite often that will mean doing nothing but listening or even being the receptacle for her fears, outbursts or frustration.  Don't try to ""fix."" As pointed out in comments, this could be indicative of something more serious that would warrant professional/medical assistance. Certainly do a bit more research and try to get her to at least see a professional if it seems more serious than just feeling the burden of those changes, but, again, not in your scope of partner-powers to apply a fix, yourself. This is a good introduction for you to parenting.  If you look at how you are framing your question, you are excited, and you want your experience be even better by her joining you, emotionally. Parenting is nothing, if not sacrificing your wants and even your viewpoint/perspective that focuses on you, for that of your child and family. To be a good father, you will need to learn to set aside your own desires for others, whether that be the unpleasant task of enforcing unpopular rules, giving up activities and social interactions to be a glorified transportation service, going to parent meetings for activities and organizations and, yourself, playing nice with other parents who may be maddeningly annoying. Start off by being entirely supportive of her needs during this period.  The experience will be life-changing and positive, even if it isn't all laughs and giggles now."
How much should you buy for your child to keep up with their peers?,"Like the others, I disagree that you should buying your child ""everything"". But I feel there is an important distinction other answers don't bring to the point, although some skirt it.  When your children asks for something ""everybody has"", ask yourself: is it a status symbol, or a tool prerequisite for participating in an activity common among its peers?  For the status symbol, such as Nike Air shoes or Disney-themed folders, I agree that they have a low priority. I disagree that you should forbid them completely. Status is important to everybody, child as well as adult, and ideally, a person will get his self-esteem through a combination of internal and external validation. Relying on external validation indeed leads to major mental problems in life, but adopting a ""I'm good enough for myself and I don't care what the world thinks of me"" attitude is also dangerous, it causes the person to lose contact with social reality. So, when the child is immersed in a culture where external status symbols are extremely important (and this is common among teenagers), having a few of them is better than having none and telling him to develop a ""the grapes are sour"" reaction to the things.  We cannot prevent absorbing the predominant values of the culture we live in, and he will want these things if everybody around him values showing status through ownership. So, try to frame these things as a luxury item, but one which is not forbidden just because it's ""bullying"" to have them - just something he only gets for special occasions, and not because it's super important to have it.  For the activity prerequisite, I'd say this is much more important. It is not about being bullied at all. But if all classmates play the same networked game and he doesn't have it, then they will talk about it to each other all the time, and he won't be able to participate not because they are bullying him, but because he cannot contribute anything. Even if he is with good friends who genuinely want to be nice to him, he will feel excluded once the game talk starts. And children and teenagers talk about games all the time.  Feeling shunned and ostracized is a very powerful negative experience for any human being, no matter what age, and it is important to prevent a child from feeling that way. So don't prevent his access to in-groups important among his circle of friends. Agree to the networked game. If everybody is talking on Facebook all the time, don't forbid a FB account because you think FB is an evil data kraken and you have sworn never to allow it in your family - if your kid doesn't get a hidden account while living with you, he'll get it first thing when he moves out for college just because he's been yearning for it all these years. But in the meantime, he'll suffer from being the outsider. And if everybody is using whatsapp instead, do get that smartphone.  Somebody else said that nothing but face-to-face communication is important. I disagree here. No single person - parent, child, or anybody - can determine how a group chooses to communicate. It doesn't even work in the highly disciplined corporate word, where multimillion dollar communication systems are shunned in favor of what the group dynamics choose as the best channel. If there is a network which is used by all his peers, it is important to let him have access to this network, instead of telling him to value face-to-face only and disregard the fact that he's missing out 90% of the things everybody else is part of.  This doesn't mean that absolutely everything from this group is indispensable and has to be automatically bought. If two friends of his like kayaking and he wants to try it too, this doesn't mean you should pay 1000 euro for a child kayak + 300 euro for full neoprene equipment. You could let him have lessons or rent a boat, and see if this is maybe just a fad which goes away two months later. Or if he wants the newest HTC alu-unibody smartphone and comes with the argument that the others use whatsapp all the time, you can agree to a smartphone, but get him a cheap model or a used one. The important thing is to enable the group activity, not to use the most convenient, flashy and expensive way to do so. "
How to protect my child from friend's over protective father?,"I think 9 is old enough to have a conversation about honesty and difference in cultures - the two things in play here. Difference in culture angle :
Explain to your son what his friend's father views as acceptable and unacceptable behaviour, while making clear your position (that we don't subscribe to those ideologies, but we wont interfere nevertheless). Please take care not to paint their entire race/nationality/what-have-you this way. For all you know, its probably just the father's personal belief system. Honesty angle :
If his friend feels stifled in these conditions, there are other ways to go about it than being dishonest and more importantly, make your son a party in the deception. I suspect this is where your concern lies mostly. Tell him so. Suggest to him (tell, may be? Definitely don't order) that he tell her he'll spend time with her, but wont change names or photos for it. Won't suddenly pretend he doesn't know her. May be he's already uncomfortable with all this? Ask him, if he is, your work just got a lot easier. If he distances himself from the deception the girl has got going,"
School told my daughter Charlie Chaplin’s speech was “offensive”,"I think the first step is to write to the PA asking for clarification: Was the video actually rejected as offensive? If I understand your post correctly, you only have your daughter's report on that. If so, exactly what about it was considered offensive? Does the school have any written policies about what is considered offensive enough to ban? Don't argue or cite the source just yet, just find out the school's policy and reasoning. It's possible there has been a misunderstanding somewhere. Once you have the facts established you can make a formal objection to the decision. Your daughter has first amendment rights when at school; the school can only block materials that will disrupt the school or which violate school polices that are not about the message. ""Offensive language"", for instance, would be a reasonable thing to ban. But tagging a video as ""offensive"" just because they don't like its message is not acceptable. At the very least, having to justify their decision in writing might make the school more thoughtful next time. I have already addressed this with my daughter, and she reports that she is no longer bothered with any of this. Taking up the fight would seem to me a way of teaching her that this stuff really is important. If you want backup then try contacting the ACLU. They believe this is important too. You might also want to ask any legal questions over on Law.SE, although you should keep them to what the law says and avoid asking for advice (e.g. ""what should I do?""). Oh, and in the meantime, your daughter can spread the video URL to her friends so they can see the video that the school wanted to ban."
What are some do's and dont's for an effective bedtime ritual?,"Read a bedtime story. A bedtime story winds him down and can be useful for talking through some special good or bad events/behaviours of the day.  Our toddler would just rip the pages out if we tried now :-) but soon we want to begin this. I'd place it after the bathroom, just before lights out. I think I'd prefer to put him in his bed after reading, to emphasize that the bed is only for sleeping. I don't want to teach him that it's okay to be awake and play in the bed; that's for outside the bed only."
"Skater teen wears shoes with holes, and doesn't care","""I always taught him not to care what other people think...""  Then congratulations! You have achieved one of your parenting goals. It's a pretty good goal, and will often stand him in good stead in resisting peer pressure, advertising and the allure of material things, etc. I understand you are embarrassed, but in your place, I would ask myself why I was embarrassed, and if this concern truly overrides my respect for my son's choices. If it doesn't, perhaps you can drop it with peace in your mind that this is part of his becoming an adult. If your concern outweighs your respect for this particular choice, start teaching your son the fine art of negotiation. Have a respectful conversation and ask him what in exchange he would be willing to give up his holey shoes for. If it's important to you, you should be able to come up with something he'll value enough to give up his feet-related freedom for. I can't guess what that is... maybe a new skate(board?) or tickets to a concert or play he'd like to see? Life will be full of such negotiations. This will be good practice for him; making sure he keeps up his end of the bargain will also teach him about integrity."
"My pre-schooler is out of control, and I feel like my parents are undermining my relationship and authority with her","She goes to my mom and dad if I yell at her or if I say ""No."" Then I get in trouble. But that's not the point. Actually, that is the point. Especially considering: I don't want her to hate me like my mother and I hate one another It sounds like your parents aren't letting you be your daughter's parent.  This is a major problem. You need to sit down and talk with your parents, and establish what your various roles are.  Explain that you are your daughter's mother, and that their actions are preventing you from having any sort of authority with your own daughter, and that it is causing problems with the relationship between the two of you. Describe the behavior issues you're seeing, and tell them that you feel like whenever you do anything to improve the situation, your daughter goes to your parents, and they take her side, effectively preventing you from acting like a parent. This may or may not be a productive conversation, depending on your parents' perspective, but the calmer you are, and the more you can avoid sounding accusatory, the better your chances of getting a positive discussion going. If it doesn't go well, ask them if they'd be willing to go to family therapy with you.   Before this conversation, you may want to crunch some numbers.  Look at rent costs for cheap housing, come up with some budgets, and look for alternatives for preschool or daycare (since your daughter is not yet 4, I'm assuming she isn't in mandatory public schooling yet).  The goal is to see if you can set an ultimatum of moving into an alternative situation, if the conversation with your parents is ultimately not productive.  Don't mention this unless it is clear that they are absolutely unwilling to compromise. Getting yourself and your daughter into a different living situation, even if you have to sacrifice a LOT, may be your best alternative, if your parents are dead-set on ignoring your role as a parent. As for your relationship with your daughter, it may be hard to find the time, but try to set aside an hour a day to do whatever your daughter wants (within reason) as ""Mommy-Daughter time"".  If you let her have general control of these play sessions (again, within reason), it may eliminate her feeling the need to create conflict with you. Ideally, the two of you will actually have fun.  However, it sounds like ""just not fighting"" would be an improvement, and may help you feel like you're not constantly fighting and harassing each other. It may not sound like much, but it can be a start."
My 4.5-year-old son has no dominant hand,"I have still not identified my dominant hand, and I'm 66 years old. I voluntarily switched from left to right for writing when I was 7, and was going to have to start using pen-and-ink instead of pencil. Generally, I use whichever hand I learned with for a given task. The only significant problem is that I started using scissors in my left hand. It would have been much more convenient if I held scissors in my right hand. For some tasks, such as drawing or using a mouse, I switch hands based on convenience. Do make sure he knows which hand is which - something that is obvious to a strongly handed child. I learned by imagining myself in the kitchen at home, and repeating ""Pantry on right, hallway on left"". This is important. Knowing facts like ""The loop of a ""b"" is to the right, the loop of a ""d"" is to the left"" was useless until I could reliably decide which side of the paper was to the right."
Grandparents mistreating my children,"You have some of the picture, and the parts you have are obviously distressing. But until you have the whole of it, I would say nothing to your parents. Talk to your wife often, and support her; she's in a difficult position. Since you're not there to do the necessary confronting, she needs to do so depending on how inappropriate the behavior is. Apparently my mom even joins the two girls in mocking/bullying my son and defends them if my wife says something. Personally, I wouldn't tolerate this behavior. If the grandparent is actually bullying the child or taking the bully's side, it's time to take the kids out for a field trip, picnic, ice cream, whatever is possible to do away from where the grandparents live. This isn't quality time for your child. Repeat as necessary. Leaving the house for a hotel is really a last resort and drastic; if the abuse is serious enough, I would consider it. How to handle it? It depends on what you see and what you expect of your relationship with your parents, and how much disposable income everyone involved has. Worst case scenario, you don't visit them any more until you have a talk and come to some kind of agreement about unkind behavior. Less drastic but still effective, see your parents away from that environment, e.g. a vacation together at the beach where if someone starts to act unkindly, you have the option to immediate get away: go swimming, go for a cold drink, a walk, etc. Your (brother/sister's) family can be invited, or you can take separate vacations with them so no ""jealousy"" issues can arise with grandma. It's important to stand up for your children. It shows them your love. Your parents are important too, though, and how you treat them is a strong model for your children regarding how they should treat you when they are adults with children. This should be considered as well in the decisions you make. I love my parents but I feel very sorry for my son. He's quite sensible and doesn't deserve to be treated like this. Of course he doesn't. But the occasions where you really have to pick between one or the other are rare (hopefully). If your son is mature enough, you can let him be part of the behind-the-scenes conversation as well."
How to get my younger sister to listen?,"You're in a complicated position, but if it helps, so are most of us parents! What works will likely be the same sort of thing that works for me with my eight year old."
Bedtime for 12-13 year old girl,"I think it's time to let go of those reins and I honestly think you'll get a very good reaction. I'd even go as far as to say don't restrict her bedtime at all. Granted, rules should be in place like: Let her be in charge of those natural consequences of whether she chooses to stay up too late (i.e. the morning schedule still remains the same so if she doesn't get enough sleep, it's on her). Depending on the type of person she is, keeping those reins tightened could result in rebellion and, in this case, this may not be one of those battles that's worth it."
Our 3½ yo girl is frustrated by not being able to colour within the lines,"At the risk of being unpopular, I would say: do nothing. She is doing everything right.  Learning itself is a difficult skill to learn. In this case, we can apply the model of ""zone of proximal development"". You have already correctly realized that people do not learn much when in their comfort zone, and need to spend some time out of it, where things are difficult, to learn new skills. And yes, you don't want your daughter to give up on the first sign of trouble.  However, not everything outside of the comfort zone is a zone where learning takes place. There is the ""zone of proximate development"", where the next level of skill is just slightly out of reach, and can be attained with a combination of persistent exercise and trying out new approaches where the earlier ones have failed. But outside of this starts a zone of mastery which is not yet attainable.  I have seen a lot of well meaning people trying to train both children or adults who were over their head. This does not work well and produces the exact symptoms you describe. The pupil tries again and again, but their current skillset is not sufficient for getting even close to the desired result, and there are no obvious ""tricks"" to try to get around the unsuccessful approach. Frustration is the one normal emotion in this case, and the other, if stakes are high, fear. Both emotions have something to tell us, and teaching your daughter to blindly push through them is not doing her a favor.  A good learner should be able to recognize both borders of the proximate zone of learning, the lower one and the high one. Your daughter has reached the high one. Recognize this, respect it, and help her cope with that situation. It does involve giving up the task - that's something she is intuitively doing right. She obviously needs more ""levels"" in her pyramid of skills (most likely more development in her nervous system before she gains more fine motor skills) until task success becomes attainable. Then she should try again. But currently, forcing her or tricking her into doing a task where she has found out that she has no chance of success will kill her long-term motivation instead of building it.  Instead, see this not as a situation where she should be improving her artistic or motor skills, but as a situation to improve her emotional coping and self-awareness skills. Name her feelings for her, and suggest a strategy to deal with them: ""It seems that no longer how often you try, you never manage to stay in the lines. I bet this makes you very frustrated, and that's why you threw that pencil. Don't worry, you can leave this and come back to it someday later and see if you can do better. No need to throw the pencil though, just lay it there and we can try playing something easier together.""  If you are specifically worried about the possibility of her becoming a perfectionist who is afraid to try things even once (even though that doesn't seem a problem in this specific situation), the way to forestall this is to praise her effort. ""It was good that you tried several times. I know that it still didn't work out, but that happens sometimes. Someday you will become better at holding a pencil, and then it will work better"". There is quite a bit of research, especially the work of C. Dweck, showing that this type of interaction is a good way (and sufficient) to get people (especially children) unafraid of trying new things and sticking to them even after initial defeat. "
Should I monitor my child's internet usage?,"Yes, I think that children's online activities should be monitored but I don't think it's feasible in practice except for very young children. Older kids will always find a way to circumvent your control – but the good news is that they get more computer-literate in the process :-) To me it's the same as having someone supervise small children at the playground or any other public place. The purpose is to make sure that they're not hurting themselves or others, aren't hurt by others, and know/learn how to engage their social environment properly. The problem is that it's much harder to supervise a computer without being intrusive. Instead of blocking and/or monitoring, approach the computer and the Internet the same way you would the playground:   Why do you trust your 16-year-old to act responsibly while unmonitored? Because you've spent enough time together and you've taught by example and by word what's right and wrong. You've seen that your child is able to fend for himself and can recognize and avoid bullies and bad places, and that he's not a bully himself.  This is much harder to do at the computer – who'd want to spend hours surfing Facebook or other ""juicy"" sites with their dad?! And with all the mobile devices existing today, and crawling into classrooms too, this will likely become even harder in the future. I don't have a future-proof solution! :-( One approach I've seen (which works for the time being) is to have a computer in the living room or family room, or make sure in other ways that nobody can hide out in front of the computer. Whatever you do at the computer needs to be okay to do while others are watching - otherwise, what exactly are you doing? I've recently moved my computer from a ""work"" room into a ""work"" corner of the living room, and even for me it's much more social now. I highly recommended it. Just now I realized that it incidentally supports the ""show, don't tell"" philosophy. I'm not sure that's feasible for the kids when we only have one computer there, though. You could have a few laptops and a house rule that they're only used in the living room, but that might be hard to enforce consistently (especially if the kids have laptops for school, which they could then simply use outside the home)."
Should I allow my child to make an alternate meal if they do not like anything served at mealtime?,"We follow the Satter Division of Responsibility in Feeding approach. The Division of Responsibility for toddlers through adolescents Fundamental to parents’ jobs is trusting children to determine how much and whether to eat from what parents provide. When parents do their jobs with feeding, children do their jobs with eating. While it's straightforward to say ""I pick what to serve, you pick whether to eat it,"" in practice it's a bit more complicated sometimes. You note that you aren't always able to include something that the child will like in a particular meal; this is particularly true with new foods, or something they haven't had in a while (tastes change over time!). In order to still meet basic nutritional needs, I will allow my kids to make an ""alternate"" meal if they really dislike everything that is being served. The go-to option is a peanut butter sandwich: not terribly exciting, but reasonably nutritious and something they can easily/quickly make themselves. The main requirement that must be met before they can make a backup sandwich is that they have tasted at least one bite of everything on the plate. Just glancing at a new recipe and declaring ""BLEAH"" will simply default to ""you are welcome to choose not to eat"" -- I'm not going to force them to clean their plate or even take that single bite. There are a couple of tangentially related things we do to minimize rejection of the provided meal, which I wanted to mention -- not directly an answer to your question, but based on comments and other answers I thought it was worth expanding on my answer. Foremost is meal planning: each weekend we sit down, all five of us, and decide what will be served when. My spouse and I need this to shop for the week, but it's also important for the kids to be included -- this is their chance to declare they absolutely hate those meatballs, reminding their parents that would be a poor choice. As they've gotten older, preparing a family meal themselves has become part of the repertoire as well (providing valuable skills training in addition to ""buy in""). Secondarily, we try to plan balanced meals that are somewhat compartmentalized. A ""one pot"" dinner may be simple, but unless every child likes every component of it, the whole stew may end up being rejected just because it happens to have carrot pieces in it. Keeping the protein, starch, and vegetables moderately separate means that they can reject part of the meal but eat (and be full/nourished from) the rest. Finally, we try to keep in mind what objections we remember when looking at new recipes. Particularly spicy or salty dishes are a no-go with the middle child, the youngest doesn't like greens, the oldest is a pescatarian and lactose intolerant -- this ends up limiting us, sometimes significantly, but keeping those restrictions in mind reduces the likelihood of a meal being completely rejected."
Should I try to protect my son from hearing that his father wants nothing to do with his two boys?,"I think you did right. Yes, this is a tough experience to be rejected like this when you are twelve, but if you really never bad-mouthed their father and still have the records of his (non-)visits, you did everything you could.  If you kept him from contacting his paternal family, I firmly believe that this would have lead to some ""mystified"" image of how this ""missing"" part of the family would have been ""oh so wonderful"" if only you hadn't been in the way. I think your son had every right to contact his father. I also think with puberty right around the corner, better now than later, as harsh as it sounds. The ball is clearly in the father's court now (and has been for years). If he refuses contact, so be it. Neither can you change the behaviour of the grandparents, some people will always support their immediate family, no matter what.  But when you are sorry that your son is missing out on family, remember that the ones missing out in this scenario are the father and the grandparents who don't get to see their grandsons grow up.  Their bad luck, IMHO."
Should I let my child play with gun toys?,"I take what I consider to be a pragmatic approach: if there is no toy which is obviously a gun, kids just make their own (60-80% of boys, 30% of girls, play with ""aggressive toys""
 of some variety). Fingers, sticks, coat hangers (which double as pretty decent fighter planes and space ships, IMHO), pencils/pens, cardboard tubes (packing tubes make great bazookas!), rocks, air, etc. And nerf/water guns can be an awful lot of fun, for kids and adults! So I don't ban make-believe or toy guns, because I think that just encourages them to learn the lesson ""just don't let dad see you do that, even though it's obviously harmless"" (from the kid's point of view). However, I avoid ""realistic looking"" guns, even though I had them as a kid. Why? Partly out of a concern for genuine misunderstanding at school or while running around - a reasonable person shouldn't have to wonder ""is that kid running around with a real gun?""  If they ask for a real looking gun, I just explain to them why I avoid them just like that - if you saw someone running around with that, especially without that little orange cap, how would you know from far away if it was real or fake? With a little explanation I always found my kids could understand how that might be bad for them (and we discussed wit with some detail right there), and then we mutually expressed how cool it looked anyway but agreed it wasn't worth it. I also avoid them because, having a real-looking gun pointed at me isn't fun for me because I've been threatened by actual guns, while having a water gun pointed at me just makes me say ""do not shoot me with that, I don't want to get wet!""  I also make a point to explain this also to my kids in age-appropriate ways - so they understand why some people might actually not want something pointed at them! If everyone who's playing isn't having fun, it isn't really fun! So I find the fun and naturalness of play-fighting to be reasonable and healthy, and encourage whatever obviously-child-play thing boys and girls like to do. My hope is that I am able teach the lesson by direct analogy: that play sword doesn't cut, but knives do, right? That play gun doesn't hurt, but a gun - just like a kitchen knife - does really hurt. Since kids get cuts and scrapes, this seems intelligible enough to them. I also accept that any amount of explanation about the difference in play and reality is going to be insufficient to inoculate them against danger.  It's an open, ongoing conversation about limits that include when something is funny and when it's just mean, the limits of allowable play-fighting, what sort of things are most dangerous, and all those other really important life topics. Toys - which and when - are part of that conversation between a parent and child, and I think it's more important that you have that ongoing conversation than any particular decision.  Finally, I think the greatest danger of all is a false sense of security. If you think that playing with guns protects them from playing with real guns, you are both in grave danger; if you think banning gun toys protects them from playing with real guns, you are both in grave danger."
What is the evidence on the danger of feeding whole blueberries and grapes to infants and toddlers?,"Summary This is mostly about grapes, not blueberries, but blueberries are probably similar. According to wikipedia, they are ""5–16 millimeters (0.20–0.63 in) in diameter"". Quotes I mainly quote (1), since I don't have full access to (2) and (3), so their relevant conclusions are also taken from (1). The physical features of a foreign body are important in determining the potential effects of aspiration. Compared with grapes, small, hard objects or foods may more easily be dislodged from the rest of the upper airway with chest or abdominal thrusts. They are also more likely to pass through the larynx and come to rest in the right main bronchus, causing respiratory difficulty but allowing ventilation of the left lung. In contrast, round foods or objects that are larger than a child's airway may cause occlusion at the level of the laryngeal inlet, resulting in complete airway obstruction that is rapidly fatal if not alleviated promptly. The threat is bigger still if such an object has a smooth, easily deformable surface allowing it to form a tight seal, wedge, and thus becomes very difficult to dislodge with first aid manoeuvres. (from (1) citing (2)) Grapes are a popular food with young children but are ideally suited to cause obstruction of a paediatric airway and are the third most common cause of food-related fatal choking episodes after hotdogs and sweets. (from (1) citing (3)) One of the authors of (1) was also interviewed in (4): “It is not just tiny, little kids – we would suggest up to the age of five the kids are more at risk because they don’t chew as well, their swallowing is not quite as coordinated and they get distracted when they are eating,” said Cooper. In (4), also Tina Newton, ""a consultant in the emergency department at Birmingham Children’s Hospital"", was interviewed Like Cooper, Newton recommends that the fruit should be cut up for children, adding that parents should also be aware of what to do if their child chokes. “For a child, turn them upside down and slap them hard on the back between the shoulder blades,” she says.

How worried should I be about head bumps as my infant learns to get around?,"Toddlers happen to be ""designed"" with the right height and mass that they very rarely injure themselves when falling from their own height.  Mostly what you need to worry about is them falling from higher than their own height, like from furniture or stairs, falling onto something sharp, or something heavy falling on them.  Most of the falls you are worrying about now, you will notice shortly that your child looks to see if you're watching before deciding whether it's worth it to cry or not.  My 18 month-old actually head butts things for fun now. My 7 year-old has cerebral palsy from her skull getting a little squished during her premature birth, so we are well acquainted with the signs of brain trauma.  Mostly what you need to look out for is a sudden change in typical behavior, like: If those things happen after a nasty fall, consult a doctor right away, or even get an ambulance depending on severity.  Bumps and bruises are not fun, but are normal and nothing to worry about.  They happen even to children of the most conscientious parents."
Am I interrupting my husband's parenting?,"I was the oldest of six kids.  My youngest brother was born when I was 18.  By the time I escaped to college, I knew all about babies.  I could change a diaper in fifteen seconds flat (well, okay, the really nasty ones took a bit longer :).  I knew how to play the ""here comes the airplane"" game to get a stubborn child to eat his carrots.  I could bathe a baby, take a baby's temperature, oil his scalp, assemble a crib or high chair, heat the bottle and test for body temperature on my inner wrist. But it wasn't until I actually became a mother that I understood the most difficult part of being a mother. When my daughter was two she tested positive for tuberculosis.  The hospital did a chest xray on her.  They clamped her between two pieces of plastic so that she couldn't move, so they could take a picture of her lungs.  It was the hardest thing I have ever had to do, standing there as she cried, terrified, clamped in that thing, calling out for me, ""ma-ma...ma-ma..."" and not doing anything but telling her over and over ""I'm so sorry little girl, we're almost done, I'm so sorry little girl..."" Before I became a mother I had no idea how unbearable the pain is when we see our babies crying.  Or how hard it is to be strong for them when we need to be.  But we need to be. You need to understand that your son is going to pick up on the conflict between you and your husband.  I'm sure he knows that it upsets you when he cries, and because of that he is going to cry whenever he is not given what he wants.  For the sake of your entire family, do not let this become an ingrained habit. Though it may seem to you like his tears are a sign of great pain inside him, please understand that children are not like adults.  They learn as infants that crying is the tool you use to get what you need. Or want. The trick is for you, as the parent, to be able to distinguish real needs from simple desires, and to recognize when his needs are in conflict with his wants. He is playing you and your husband off against each other, and I'm sorry, this is not what you want to hear, but you are enabling him to do it.  Yes, it is your fault that your son prefers you over his father.  You are the one who gives him what he wants, whether he should have it or not.  You are the one who cannot be firm with him.  ""Ruining his mood"" should not even be a consideration.  Understand where the responsibility is...any person, even a child, is responsible for their mood.  (In the absence of any real danger or abuse) if they feel unhappy, they have made themselves unhappy.  In effect, they are choosing to be unhappy. There is absolutely no way you can avoid ""making"" a child unhappy periodically.  Children want what they shouldn't have, and don't want what they should have. When they don't get exactly what they want, they are unhappy.  This is normal and expected.  It is not something you should feel guilty or responsible for.  If you do what is best for him and he cries, it is all right to offer some sympathy, but not to allow him to see that it gives him power over you. You must choose their welfare over your own feelings.  In this case, it is your feelings which need to be your focus.  The more you allow him to manipulate your feelings, the worse it will get.  You husband can be your ally in this...it's okay to use him as a shield sometimes (like when you asked him to feed your son fruit so you didn't have to) but do not ask for his help and then undermine him when your son resists by crying.  Bluntly put; he is trying to use you as a tool to avoid obeying his father. (Please note that I am not advocating ignoring crying children if they are actually in danger or distress; this is clearly not the case here) But don't overuse this technique, you need to make it clear to your son that no amount of crying or ""sadness"" will divert you from doing what is best for him.  Otherwise he will completely dominate you whenever you do not have your husband's support. You are the mommy.  He is a child.  You know what he should do, what is best for him, what is safest.  You know what he needs to learn in order to become a responsible, mature adult.  Of course he will resist you, with whatever tools he realizes he has.  That is why children need parents.  Because they do not yet know what you know...how to make good decisions. Definitely do as anongoodnurse has suggested and read parenting books together with your husband.  Discuss techniques to use the advice that you gain from the books.  And counseling would be very beneficial if you can afford it.  You need to make your husband your partner and ally, not your adversary.  Your entire family will benefit or suffer depending on how you handle this situation. One additional observation; sometimes it might seem simpler to contemplate raising your son without his father's ""interference"", but just imagine what it would be like living with a child who grows up knowing that he can have anything he wants just by using his own emotional state as a tool.  Without your husband as a balancing factor, it can only get worse.  Both of you have strengths to bring to your partnership, and both have (often corresponding) weaknesses.  Understanding and respecting your partner's strengths, and accepting help in your weaknesses, is what a good counselor can help you both do."
How can I convince my parents to accept my approach on school?,"If you want them to accept your approach, you're going to have to show them you've truly mitigated that risk.  The only way I can see to do that is landing some good-paying ($25/hour+) programming work and delivering to satisfied customers.  I wish you the best of luck, but I highly advise you to keep as many options open as possible.  Life rarely works out the way you plan."
What would you do if you are pretty sure your son is heading towards a disastrous marriage? [closed],"If my daughter came home with a nice person or clearly the wrong guy: So, I'd give any potential mate all the rope I could without judgement. We would  shine a bright light on him.  I'd allow him to show me how great he is or show her what sort of mistake he would be -- all while supporting her. I personally believe that rebellion* is a part of maturing and I do not want her to rebel to her own detriment. *In our house there will be no tattoos or piercings until she is 18 and can pay for them. However currently, her hair is shaved on about a third of her head and is dyed green and purple. I really dislike it and I tell her so. It gives her something to rebel over without doing her/us any permanent harm."
"Toddler made ""incorrect"" animal identification that is actually correct. Better to correct her or not?","Overextension and related phenomena (including the opposite, underextension) are very common, even expected phases in language acquisition. Some children call all four-legged animals ""dogs"" for a period, while others reject the idea that a chihuahua and a German Shepherd are both ""dogs"". As a child, I thought that ""park"" meant only playground equipment. I guess my parents would ask, ""Do you want to go to the park?"" and I'd think of the only part that was interesting to me at that age. Addition: (This is also what's happening in this famous clip... the girl is not clueless, but overextending!) Your niece has a mental concept of what a kitty is, and she's doing the right thing by testing it out on new specimens, even if she has to refine her guesses later. Correction of these usages by parents is not always effective.* All children have to figure out the boundaries of word meanings for themselves. This happens through trial and exposure. But if you're concerned about ensuring she gets the right information and don't know how to explain the subtleties of animal taxonomy to a toddler... one way can be to gently prod her to think about it. Confirm part of her hypothesis, but add to it or problematize it: — Yook, a kitty! — Yes, look at the lion! Isn't he fierce? The child becomes helpfully perplexed about the meaning of your comment and accommodates the new information, either now or later on when she observes that those around her don't say ""kitty"" when they see that animal. When you say ""yes"" but use a different word, she's likely to come to the right conclusion: that what she said isn't wrong but it isn't the best or most specific term. Alternatively, there's no harm in directly correcting her. The worst that can happen is that she might ignore or contradict you (for now), and hey, if she's got some metalinguistic gifts she might actually listen and apply what you tell her directly. — Yook, a kitty! — That's not a kitty, honey — kitties live in our houses. It's a lion. Isn't he fierce? To put it shortly, don't fret over it. Correct her directly or indirectly, or just let it slide. She will work it out, along with her other inevitable grammar mistakes, as she grows up. * Indeed, children rarely learn from direct correction. Some types of errors, such as the one in the following exchange between a linguist and his son, are even harder to address through explicit instruction: — Child: Want other one spoon, Daddy.
— Father: You mean, you want the other spoon.
— Child: Yes, I want other one spoon, please, Daddy.
— Father: Can you say ""the other spoon""?
— Child: Other... one... spoon.
— Father: Say ""other"".
— Child: Other.
— Father: ""Spoon.""
— Child: Spoon.
— Father: ""Other... spoon.""
— Child: Other... spoon. Now give me other one spoon?

An incident happened at school and child didn't (want to) tell the parent,"My friend obviously did not react well when she found out about the incident. How should she make up for it to her daughter? She should apologize. You say your friend didn't react ideally, I'd say she reacted stupidly. She got angry at her daughter because she was clueless when everyone else wasn't. Her daughter did nothing wrong, and your friend got angry for selfish reasons. She should therefore tell her daughter that she's sorry she got angry, and that it's ok for her daughter to judge for herself what she wants to tell her and what not (especially since this didn't involve the daughter directly and she doesn't seem to have been in any danger that would have required parental involvment). Should she even try to get her to talk about it? No. Her daughter didn't want to tell her, for whatever reasons (see below). So your friend, IMO, should tell her daughter that she's ready to listen if the daughter wants to talk about it, but then she should be patient.  The whole situation strikes me as the behaviour of people who gather around a fight, or the victim of an accident, because there is a spectacle and they don't want to miss anything. The daughter is an eye-witness, so mom wants to know how it all happened. But really why should she be involved? The teacher lost control of himself/herself and hit a classmate, but this can be sorted out without the whole town population gossiping about it based on hear-say and half-truths. At the schools I know personally, when something out of the ordinary happens which parents need to be made aware of, the school administration informs the parents directly. So while I understand the urge to get the story from your own child, it's not like you're kept in the dark when your child doesn't tell you what happened. The official information by the school can be a way to prompt the child and signaling interest - ""I got this letter from school that a teacher beat a child - that sounds scary to me. I'd like to know more. Do you want to tell me about it?"" - but then give the child the option of not talking, or talking about it at a later time. Is it the fear of re-living the trauma that kept the child quiet? Something else? It might be trauma-related. But witnessing an event that might potentially be traumatic doesn't necessarily lead to a psychological trauma, and people don't always react the same when they are actually traumatized (e.g. trying not to think of it and not wanting to talk about it is just one possible reaction). There could also be lots of other reasons for her silence, such as She likes the teacher and, knowing he/she did something wrong, didn't want to get him/her in trouble She doesn't like the classmate who was beaten and thinks he had it coming to him, and knows that when she says as much, mom will tell her that she's wrong because a teacher should never hit a child, and she doesn't want to have that discussion. She is ashamed that she didn't speak out or try to defend her classmate against the teacher She likes both her classmate and her teacher, and is disturbed she can't figure out where her loyalties should lie More generally, she might simply need some more time to sort things out in her mind before talking about it (added thanks to mtraceur and Llewellyn) She thinks she witnessed something that isn't for her to spread around She's already discussed what happened with her classmates to her satisfaction, and doesn't need someone who wasn't there to join the discussion. Her mom usually overreacts in her daughter's eyes and the daughter doesn't want to deal with that (kudos to aneder for suggesting this in a comment) Your friend can watch her daughter for further symptoms of trauma. But again, she shouldn't assume her daughter is traumatized as a matter of course. I witnessed a teacher slap a classmate twice when I was in school, and that was when hitting kids in school had already been outlawed. We kids vividly discussed it in the next break and on the way home, because it felt wrong and forbidden. None of us seemed traumatized by it. I did tell my parents, but mostly because I was worried about what would happen to the teachers, both of whom I liked, if the kids who had been slapped told their parents. I knew the teachers had done something that might get them in trouble, and wanted my parents to explain what might happen next. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't have brought it up, because I didn't feel it was any of my parent's business."
The school has assigned reading I feel is inappropriate for my son to read. How do I approach this problem with the school and with my son?,"Since you're not thrilled about the depiction of violence in the book, but are reluctant to have your child singled out as different, maybe you could read it with him and discuss the violence and brutality.  Use this as a teaching situation, where you can listen to his interpretation of the violent themes in the book and add in your own two cents."
How do I explain the reasons behind protesting and rioting to my children?,"As others remarked, the riots are puzzling to us adults as well — that's the reason you are asking. We are struggling to explain it not because there is a truth so terrible that it is unsuited for children; it's rather that it seems morally wrong and not conducive to the eventual goal of achieving racial justice. So why are people rioting and looting anyway? One answer is that we humans don't always act rationally, and don't always act morally. I'm sure that you can find general examples for that in something your children did: They lashed out to somebody out of frustration, or did something they were not supposed to do because an opportunity presented itself. But without addressing the underlying social reasons the picture would not be complete: Where does the frustration come from? Why specifically looting?  I personally think that it can be explained, also to a 6 year old, by the structural injustice simmering. Note that I'm not handing out a moral judgement here — rather, I'm observing.  Wages have, since the 1970s, not risen with the economic growth the way they used to before.1 The resulting prosperity has gone to very few who live in a state of unreal wealth that used to be reserved for kings and queens. Many normal people feel they don't have a chance to ever get their hands on one of the Dolce & Gabbana bags at display in the stores on 5th Avenue. And yet they are  presented in the store windows almost as if intentionally mocking and teasing: ""See, here I am, an arm's length away, but you'll never get me. I am here not for you, I'm here for the others."" It's not surprising that in a moment of emotional upheaval, in an excited crowd, feeling short-changed all the way, without any fear of being punished for it, people grab what they can get. I can also see why the looters may not have that much of a bad conscience. You can explain racism and systemic economic short-changing by an example. If you were systematically unfair to one of your children (I think you have more than one), the way the stepmother is in fairy tales; if you always excluded the same sibling from nice clothes, dessert, cuddling, give them less pocket money etc. In a word, if you were systematically discriminating against one sibling — how would that make them feel? Could they imagine to lose it if once again they don't get a present on Christmas while the other sibling plays with their new Xbox? Maybe they would take some of the sibling's toys away and hide them? Maybe they would even throw a tantrum and knock the Xbox off the shelf?? I think children are perfectly able to understand such a situation.

How do my husband and I get over our fear of having another difficult baby?,"I wonder if everyone goes through this and I'm just weak and bad at coping. No, you're not weak, and you're not bad at coping. For most parents who have had a traumatic first child, what you're going through is normal. Your therapist and your pediatrician can confirm this. There are no guarantees in life. Your second child may be just as difficult, but you'll have so much more experience and support in dealing with difficult infants (if that is the case), or your second baby can be a little angel. I know of a young couple who had a seriously difficult first baby. First, she had intrauterine growth restriction, and the mom had to have weekly ultrasounds from about 20 weeks on. The baby was born, seemed healthy, and on the third day, had three apnea episodes, the third one in the Emergency Room when she completely stopped breathing and had to be coded. She was intubated and in the intensive neonatal care unit for 10 days. She had hyperbilirubinemia which needed to be treated for 5 days. They never found out why she stopped breathing (which is worse psychologically because what if it happens again?), so she was sent home on two different monitors simultaneously, one for 6 months, the second for a year. She was a fussy baby, to put it mildly. Every waking moment for many months, she had to be swaddled to mom (or in an infant carrier on mom.) Sleep was hard to come by. If I had gone through that, I don't think I could face the possibility again. But accidents happen, and the wife got pregnant. She had a perfectly unremarkable second pregnancy, and the baby was the most laid-back baby I have ever seen (and I've seen many). The pregnancies and outcomes were polar opposites. I used to do deliveries, so I saw similar situations play out (sometimes worse than what I described). There was only one time the second pregnancy/babyhood was as bad or worse than the first. My husband really is adamant he doesn't want another child, and I am grieving the loss of our dreams for a big family.  I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope with counseling, he'll change his mind. I understand the grieving you're doing, and you both need to be willing to take the leap. It is not likely that the second will be like the first, if for no other reason, babies are different and you have experience now. How do other people do it? They take a leap of... faith, I guess. Faith that they can do it. They love having the first child enough/want a larger family/want a sibling for the first/whatever to take a risk. Some don't, and only have that one child. But most do take the leap. I wish you the best as you work through this."
Foreign student required to learn and recite the pledge of allegiance in Kindergarten (U.S),"Assuming a public school setting, legally, your daughter's teacher is clearly in the wrong here.  The famous 1943 Supreme Court case West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette ruled that students cannot legally be coerced to salute or recite the Pledge of Allegiance.  In the majority opinion of the court, Justice Robert H. Jackson wrote: If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein. I would suggest that you familiarize yourself with the court case and then make an appointment to meet your your daughter's teacher and the school principal.  Start our by explaining that you are not comfortable with your child being forced to participate in the Pledge of Allegiance.  The teacher and principal may be understanding, or they may not.  If they are not, I would suggest that you then explain to them that what they are doing is illegal, citing the Supreme Court's ruling on the subject."
How to encourage children to do their homework?,"...knowledge and mastery ought to be its own reward. Question: do you work (at your job) for free because it's rewarding and what you want to do? No, you work because you get a paycheck for it. (I did do some of my work - but not the majority - for free.) Ideally knowledge and mastery are its own reward, but that's not real life. Pardon my skepticism, but that's non-sense until one is free to make one's own choices. Doing things they don't care for is character building, fulfilling unpleasant expectations, and a lot of other preparations for real adult life. It's also tedious. So, whatever you can do to help them build character and do tedious things that are expected of them is a real win for all. You can do what @Rory suggests: make it fun. Or reward them when they have done their homework without complaint or drama by reading them an interesting story. Or have a ""star chart"" (I wouldn't use stars) and the older one at least, can delay gratification for a movie night or something else she'd like for a certain number of stickers. Although this may be far afield, please consider: what makes you a successful adult? Is it your knowledge or your ability to obtain the knowledge you need? Is it what you can do, or your ability to keep at it until you master what you need to master? Praise these things in your children. Homework is often drudgery. Praise them on their ability to control their impulse to give up. Praise them on the ability to do it without drama. Praise whatever effort is praiseworthy. But, mostly, praise the process, not the outcome."
Do I really need to wake my newborn to feed him?,"As long as he is getting enough in each 24-hour cycle, and he remains on-course on his weight chart, and if he can sleep 4-5 hours between feedings, then go with that and don't wake him up.  I would only wake him if there's reason to be concerned. "
Can an infant choke on spit-up?,"According to NICHD: No. Myth: Babies who sleep on their backs will choke if they spit up or
  vomit during sleep. Fact: Babies automatically cough up or swallow fluid that they spit up
  or vomit—it’s a reflex to keep the airway clear. Studies show no
  increase in the number of deaths from choking among babies who sleep
  on their backs. In fact, babies who sleep on their backs might clear
  these fluids better because of the way the body is built. You also should visit the website and learn as much as you can. "
Is it too late to read for my baby?,"It is not too late at all. Please do try to limit TV, and of course you are tired after working all day. However, this is also your job. Reading, playing, walking to the park -- all of these things are important. Talking about what you are doing -- ""I am making dinner. This is a carrot. I am using the sharp knife to cut it."" There are many books in your library. Going to the library is pure magic for kids. Often libraries have children's areas and reading and playgroups. Where is your child during the day? I hope that the caregiver(s) read to him as well."
Son chooses what my daughter chose then gets upset he doesn't get it,"Explain the problem and your solution clearly. The 5-year-old probably is able to understand first come first served. If your rule is the first to speak gets their way, be clear that is why the girl gets her choice. Trying to use your interpretation of his motivations in explaining the rule may not be clear if he doesn't understand his feelings using those words; often children (most people really) have some trouble being clear about why they want what they want. If you want to continue to offer choices but don't want to worry about competition only allow one to choose at a time. Instead of ""kids pick your plates."" Say ""[one kid] it is your turn to pick first, [other kid] you will get to pick first next time."" Since the 5-year-old feels he's been losing I would offer him first pick first. Keeping track of whose turn it is across multiple activities with multiple care takers is left as an exercise for the reader. Or ask him. A 5-year-old probably has some notions of fairness, and a conversation about it is a great way to help align them with yours. Be sure you have good support for your notions of fairness; I would have a good explanation or two (the more ways you can explain tricky concepts the more likely one will be understood) of why ""I always get my way"" is not acceptable ready and then try to work out how his plans lead to it."
How best for a trans/non-binary person to respond to their 6-year-old cousin asking if I'm a girl or a boy?,"A six year old is too young to have developed strong prejudices, and young enough to be confronted with new things every day. Therefore you should talk to the parents to make sure you don't step onto their toes, and unless they are strictly against it, you tell the kids the truth. So if you are a transgender woman, you would say that you are a woman. If they have seen you looking male, you can tell them that you used to dress more like a male, but you are not doing that anymore. If you don't (yet) look 100% like a stereotypical woman, you can tell them that you are working on looking more like a woman. A six year old can handle the truth, and in the end, the truth is the least confusing for them."
"What age limit is appropriate for using tools (such as screwdrivers, hacksaw, drill, etc.)?","Using tools is not based on age, but instead on maturity and training. My 9-year-old has his own toolkit. There is a screwdriver, hammer, saw, and a couple other things that are his. He needs to ask permission before ""fixing"" or building anything (largely to ensure it's not something I particularly want to keep in one piece). However, as we work together on projects, he learns how to use the various tools and I learn what his relative skill level is (and use that to decide how much I need to hover when he starts his own project). He can hammer unsupervised, he can't touch a drill without asking (because that's Mommy's drill, in addition to safety reasons!) The toolkit includes items like safety glasses and band-aids. This helps emphasize proper and safe usage; putting on goggles to protect his eyes every time no matter what also helps get him in the right frame of mind. Tools are not toys, and should be used properly both for safety and effectiveness (hammers are for nails, screwdrivers for screws, etc.) When he's helping me on a home improvement project, he brings his tools even though I've got my own. They're sized for his hands and grip, and he is learning how to select the appopriate tool for the job. If he needs to borrow something, however (e.g. I've never bought him a hacksaw), he can. A teenager should get training on how to properly use tools to ensure that he will not injure himself (or damage the tool or work). Banning tools as dangerous restricts his ability to learn -- nobody magically has the necessary knowledge to effectively use a hacksaw once they reach a certain age, it comes with experience (and ideally with tutelage)."
Kid throwing ice cream cone back to the vendor,"You already have received a fine answer to which I want to add a bit. Kids that age pretty much wear their feelings on their sleeves, and while fake crying as manipulation isn't rare, the whole thing looked quite genuine to me. Genuine sadness is not a punishable offense; it is always an appropriate option (and one I would choose) to console the child in the case of genuine sadness. Should she have punished her kid for throwing the cone? Punished? No. Maybe spoken to her about it later, assuming she's a bit older than 1 year. The child was having a hard time with her emotions, and justly so. It's wise to help children learn to process their emotions in a socially acceptable way, but it doesn't happen quickly. I would not have been surprised at all by the child's reaction. What would be the ideal response on the part of the mother? As a mother (but not really versed in the culture in which the event took place), I would say that the ideal response would be for the mom to have a word with the vendor after things settled down. I would simply say that my child was too young to understand that kind of jesting, and please to avoid doing it in the future. Really, the vendor is emotionally exploiting the child for the amusement of adult onlookers. That is - in my opinion - inappropriate. Kids are powerless enough; they don't need an adult to show them how much worse it could be."
"I want to expose my 5-year-old daughter to boys and girls toys equally, but she just turned her nose up at Star Wars. What do I do?","Offer her more, different things. And if she likes pink, then just let her be pink! I am sure you are not holding ""boy""-things away from your daughter, but if she doesn't care or them, that's life and how your daughter is. Certain LEGO play sets1 may still catch her attention (just find something pink). But above all, keep in mind: While having girls, and later women, no longer restricted to their classical roles, that is still where at least some of them will be most happy. As long as you show her that there are other paths she may choose, and she just chooses differently, you are on the right path yourself! 1There are several current LEGO themes targeted at girls: Friends, Elves, and Disney Princess. There are also DUPLO sets (for younger children) in the Disney Princess theme. Lastly, there is a wide variety of ""girl"" sets, which have plenty of pink."
"My son is being hit by a friend, and we need to discuss the situation with his mom","How you act in this situation depends a lot on how much you and your daughter want to see this friendship continue.  Make sure to evaluate this from the perspective of how it affects your children, not Joe.  I know this might come off as a bit heartless, but Joe isn't your responsibility.  Your children are.  As such you need to worry about what is best for them. No matter what you decide, bring up your concerns with Joe's mother.  Tell her you are worried about the physical and emotional well-being of both of your kids.  As long as Joe is aggressive, you can't have him near your son (and possibly your daughter).  Let her know that something needs to be done before you are willing to let Joe be with your kids.  You don't need to specify what has to happen, but you can lay out a completely reasonable expectation that whatever happens needs to assure the safety of your children. If she makes a reasonable effort to get Joe help, you can then decide if you are comfortable having him hang around your kids.  If she doesn't, or what she does is insufficient, don't allow your kids to play with Joe (hopefully it doesn't come to this, but you can't control what others will do).  Maybe this will help Joe and his mother to realize that something needs to be done and then Joe can get the help he really needs. Good luck. Addendum regarding the birthday party: For the birthday specifically, that gets tricky in that your daughter may want Joe there but your son clearly does not. If Joe's mom or someone could keep an real close eye on him (or if he can get some help prior to the party) you could allow it if you are comfortable (you will have to work with your son to help him feel safe). But again it boils down to taking care of your kids first and then what you are comfortable with. Trying to weigh your children's opposing desires along with your responsibility to your kids is really only something you can do. Talk it out with your kids / partner."
How can I brush my toddler's teeth when he won't let me?,"Our daughter displayed many of the same behaviors your cite and we had to resort to having one parent hold her while the other brushed her teeth properly. What we found helpful, though, was to have the parent brushing the teeth to say the vowels aloud - Aaaaaa, Eeeeeeeeee, Iiiiiiiiiii, Ooooooooooo, Uuuuuuuuuuu, and sometimes Yyyyyyyyyyyyyy - and to encourage her to say them. After a few times, she lessened her resistance. Our thought was that she understood that when the vowels ended, the brushing would end, giving her a cue as to how long the session would last and how close it was to ending. It also gave her something to do. Not long after she started saying the vowel sounds, too, which further distracted her and made brushing easier for everyone involved. Another thing to try is to have another parent brush his or her teeth at the same time. Let your son see that brushing teeth is something his parents do, as well. Children are naturally interested in imitating the behaviors of their parents. If none of the above work, try compromising by letting your son brush his own teeth himself after you brush them. (This works particularly well if he's at that stage where he wants to do everything himself.) In short, you explain that you will brush his teeth - Aaaaaa, Eeeeeeeeee, Iiiiiiiiiii, Ooooooooooo, Uuuuuuuuuuu, and sometimes Yyyyyyyyyyyyyy - and afterwards he can hold the brush and brush them himself. Good luck!"
"9-year-old received tablet as gift, but he does not have the self-control or maturity to own a tablet","From a more general angle.  We allow kids in the family to use tablets, but of course this is under supervision. Concerning damage, it's going to happen. As a final parting note, watch out for that burst of energy that comes after extended tablet use.  The two most popular times are in the morning and before bed.  Plan for play time after morning use, and play time before evening use.  Limit bed time use to extremely boring shows."
"Is it possible to spoil a child, but still teach them not to behave spoiled?","I see a lot of things that you can do just in the question, though I'm not sure there's a true answer to your question.   First of all, one of the hardest things for children to deal with is inconsistency.  Having Grandma treat him one way and (Step)Mom/Dad treat him another way is very confusing.  This is not to say that you should not treat him differently: it's to say that this is to be expected to be confusing. You can and should talk to him about this difference.  Nine is old enough to be very self-aware, and he is very much capable of understanding why you do the things you do.  Not all at once, of course - but breaking it down into small doses, he will be able to understand. Have these conversations at non-stressful times, on their own, not connected to any particular behavioral issue.  Tell him why you treat him differently, and how it will impact his life.  Think of all of this from his point of view: things like ""We don't want to spoil you"" aren't going to make sense, and aren't going to be helpful.  Rather, things like: You're nine years old now, a growing boy, and we would like to help you develop independence.  We'd like to help you get to the point that you can go play by yourself, go over to a friend's house without us accompanying you.   and As you get older, you're going to need to learn how to take care of yourself - since we won't always be there.  Things like doing the dishes and setting the table are ways you can help out now, and learn how to do things for yourself.  And, when you do learn some of these things, you get more control - not just over who gets what plate, but eventually you can help make dinner and decide what we eat.  Just as long as it's not macaroni and cheese every night... Second, learning responsibility starts with small steps.  One small task to start with - set the table before dinner, say.  Have a small, appropriate reward tied to it.  One example I use for my younger child: if he wants dessert, he has to either unload the dishes from the dishwasher (if clean) or load the dinner dishes in the dishwasher.  He gets to choose whether he does that or not; if he doesn't, he doesn't get dessert that night, though.  Most nights I get to sit on the couch while the dishes are done, of course. This sense of responsibility is important, because it will help him feel that he is a capable child.  The issue here is likely not that he is simply unwilling to do these things - he is likely of the opinion that he is unable to take care of himself. Third, when faced with him doing something that he feels he cannot (like getting a glass), keep two things in mind.  One, don't assume he can, from his point of view.  Ask him why he cannot, and address those concerns.  Perhaps he's worried he'll drop it - maybe Grandma doesn't let him get glasses down for that reason, and has instilled in him a sense of fear about glasses; or perhaps he as dropped a few, and is scared for that reason. And two, combine love with firmness.  If you've decided he can get the glass for himself, then don't get the glass for him, no matter what; but keep up the loving, caring feedback.  Even if he gets more upset, keep being loving and caring.  You can help him help himself get through this - but it will take a lot of caring and loving for him to feel supported enough.  Maybe this time he ends up giving up on the glass - but next time, perhaps, he's thirsty enough to get it.  Do consider other circumstances as to whether this is the right time to have a firm stance - is it 8:00pm and he's very tired?  Maybe not then.  But, if he's otherwise in a normal mood, that's the time to push. Finally, I think there's still likely work that can be done with Grandma.  This follows the same path as with your son: baby steps.  Find one small thing that can be phrased as an entirely reasonable request, and can be explained as something you're working with him on, and ask her to help you - don't phrase it as asking her to change her habits because they're wrong. Hi Dot - We're working with Simon on setting the table right now.  Is there any way you could help out, by getting him to help set the table at your place sometimes?  We're trying to help teach him how to set it properly, and I know you're really knowledgeable about place-setting, so you could be a real help here. Don't focus on the bigger things, at least for now.  Giving him toys isn't a big deal.  You can work with your son over time to find solutions for this - like giving his toys to the needy.  The big deal is personal responsibility and independence, and you can work with Grandma in baby steps to get to where that is possible."
8-year-old son keeps claiming he's not smart enough to do his homework,"Consider the possibility of a learning disability, ADHD, or other obstacle that's interfering with his ability to either learn the material or express his knowledge. The issue may be a lot bigger than struggling with homework, and it's common for such children to see themselves as stupid or dumb — they know they're behind their classmates, and this leads to a self-reinforcing idea that they ""can't ever do it"". Long-term interventions such as tutoring, altered workloads, and so on can be more easily put in place if there's a professional diagnosis. Regardless of whether you pursue that investigation or what the results are, you still need an plan for now that can help make homework manageable. Spending hours on third or fourth grade homework is not typical, and I don't think it is what the teacher intends, either. When homework is this difficult, it becomes a time sink for everybody in the family: your son is stuck at his desk all evening, and you're working with both his academic struggle and his personal frustration. Have a snack and break before homework starts. School is a long period of behaving nicely and sitting still. And since lunch was at least a few hours ago, kids are typically really hungry. That's not a good state of mind to try to focus on More Work. The best type of snack and break is found through experimentation. Consider what sort and how long of a break works best. If my son plays a video game before he starts on homework, his performance is radically worse. Something physical (even just running in circles outside) makes a big difference. Also think about the type of snack. If he has pure carbs (e.g. a bagel) without any protein (e.g. a smear of peanut butter), he tends to fidget a lot more. Stay nearby while he's working. This depends a bit on the child; sometimes they don't want supervision or assistance, or may even be frustrated with the parent that is making them do work. However, there are some advantages. If you can notice quickly that he's working poorly, it's easier to stop early than it is to have to redo the entire assignment. Reread the instructions, restate your and the teacher's expectations (tidy handwriting, attention to work), etc. If he has questions, he can easily ask rather than needing to go find you (or guess). Just having company can be a comfort when doing something stressful. Watch closely for exhaustion and frustration, and redirect as needed. Doing his homework when sad/angry isn't productive. You mention that you take walks together; that's a great idea. Find other, perhaps smaller/shorter, things that you can do that distract him (working on dinner preparation, playing with toys, random housework or repairs, cleaning). Take small breaks between assignments, or even within assignments. A pile of homework can be overwhelming. A collection of shorter tasks, and a plan to finish, is much more achievable. (This answer covers that nicely, so I digress.) Praise his effort, and redirect self-demeaning statements. Putting in so many hours for what feels like so little result is a lot of work, emotionally and physically and mentally. When he cries that he's stupid, come back with You're not. I can tell you're having a hard time, and I'm proud of you for working so hard. I'm here to help you get through it. Consider a reward system, both short-term (when you're done you can watch cartoons) and long-term (if you finish your homework for five days straight, you can get a new book). Any incentives like ""this helps you learn"" or ""your teacher says you have to"" are too abstract. Keep asking for dialogue with his teacher. You mentioned ""when we asked about how well he does we were deflected with a response about how nice he is"" — At only two weeks into the school year, that may be all she does know about him (he's nice to classmates and isn't causing trouble). She may not see the same stress, crying, and anger that you do at home. Show that you support your son and you are concerned, about both his lack of content mastery and about the impact on his self-esteem. Despite the opinion of most school-age children, teachers assign homework for practice, not torture. If that homework isn't being done (or done well), then it isn't achieving its goal and hopefully she can work with you to figure out what isn't working and how it can be adjusted."
How to talk to parents about my mental health,"There are some problems common to many parents: One approach is to write down all the responses (all of them, not just the hurtful ones) that you can remember. Evaluate them to see if they might fall into any of the above categories. If they do,  categorize them, and see which are the most used methods of responding. Then preempt the ""canned"" responses up front. If you've removed a barrier to communication, you're more likely to make progress. (Give them credit in your calculations for the good responses.) Easy example: if they might be preoccupied or short on time, ask them before you start a conversation if this is a good time to talk about something that might take some time. If they admit that it's not, ask them to schedule a block of time in the near future for a discussion with you. (We did this twice a week with our kids to discuss any issues we or they had with each other; we all listened, then we brainstormed.) Then write it down somewhere to remind both parties (the refrigerator works.) Make sure there are no conflicts close to that time! Parents who think their main roll is to solve problems will take that approach first, so, early in the conversation, tell them politely and kindly what you're not looking for - any quick solutions. If they resort to a quick solution anyway, gently remind them that you are asking them for (something deeper/to be heard/taken seriously about your struggles.) Then continue to tell them about your struggles. Repeat as necessary. If they feel guilty in some way, they might engage in blame shifting (implying that your actions, not theirs, are responsible for your feelings.) This is harder. It might help if you put them at ease before you get into the gist of your issues by telling them (if it's true) that you're grateful for everything they do for you, and give some real, concrete examples. Let them know that you take responsibility for your actions, but you want this to be about your feelings. (This preempts blame shifting. No one can truly control how they feel. People feel what they feel.) If they change the subject and blame your actions, let them finish their sentence, tell them you heard them, then remind them that you asked them for something different. Repeat as needed or it becomes obvious that it's fruitless to continue on this occasion. Parents who haven't had empathy from their own parents will struggle with it themselves unless they made a conscious effort - before becoming parents - to avoid repeating the mistakes of their parents. The responses they make are painful. It takes a fair amount of courage to let them know that a response hurt you. It's completely fair to say (as gently as possible) that a response hurt your feelings, makes you feel put down or criticized (whatever the truth is), and that you're looking for help with your feelings, not to feel worse. (""Gently"" means you're not interrupting them, you wait a moment before responding, then quietly proceed, first telling them you heard them and you understand what they're saying and why they think (what they've expressed), then owning your feelings (e.g. along the lines of ""I have a problem with my self image. I feel bad about myself. When you say... I feel even worse, like I've failed again... I'm not looking for you to fix my feelings, but I am looking for some help with them."") Ask if they can just listen. Ask if they can understand that you feel, and then maybe think of something more helpful. (Be forewarned: if you try this and they perceive an accusation, the ""conversation"" might immediately be shut down by a more vigorously hurtful response. You can try again later when you're feeling stronger and they've calmed down.) If parents are frightened of your pain (this is something they probably don't even know themselves; these are people who simply don't believe you have a problem, because they don't want to believe you have a problem. It's too scary to tolerate.), you probably can't have a meaningful conversation with them. The same is true if they have a mental illness themselves that prevents them from seeing things from another person's viewpoint. In that case, I would simply tell them you're struggling and would like to see if speaking with a therapist would help. If that's out of the question, then start looking for a therapist or a kind ear in an adult yourself: your school psychologist (if there is one), a guidance counselor, a favorite teacher, or other. You can even make use of hotlines for people with serious depression or call Crisis Intervention (if it exists where you are) to ask if there's any help they can give you in finding affordable therapists. Some kindhearted therapists do pro bono (or nearly so) work. If all else fails, try a helpful self-help book (my go-to recommendation is Dr. Kabat-Zinn's Wherever You Go, There You Are. Although it sounds new-agey, it's a great resource for depression. Dr. Kabatt-Zinn refined his practice recommendations when asked to start a clinic for dealing with depression in terminally ill patients.) You're far from alone, and I can certainly relate. If you have questions, please comment, and I'll try to deal with it with an edit. Good luck, and vow now not to repeat their mistakes with your own kids. Edited to add: If they believe they know why you're depressed/other, and they think they know the solution, they'll keep trying to convince you of that. You need to tell them that you've heard them, and acknowledge part of their perception: ""Maybe you're right that I would feel better if (""..."") but I'm struggling now with my feelings, which get in the way of doing (""..."") Can we focus on that for a while? On how (lonely/depressed/hopeless/alone/other) I'm feeling? Because they might think you're just not hearing what they are telling you is the problem. Also, if they start straying and telling you what other stuff they're upset about, if's fair to tell them that they're changing the subject, or to please not pile things up on you right now, you're already overwhelmed by your feelings. It's not easy, but it's quite fair."
How do I make sure I don't mix up identical twin newborns?,"My wife and I faced this very issue with our twin boys, now four years old.  When we first brought them home from the hospital, we kept the little wristbands on them for the first few weeks, until they started to outgrow them.  Then, we painted their big toe a different color so that we had a foolproof way of keeping track -- the nail polish wouldn't come off easily, and even when it did start to come off, it would generally leave traces of the color for a while.  After a few months we managed to identify tiny differences (small moles, different patterns to the way their hair swirled, etc.) that we could use, and once we were confident that the differences were there to stay, we stopped painting their nails. I studied philosophy in college and my wife is a linguist, so besides being two people from professions that should never be permitted to raise identical twins (physicists being another group that should also be so banned, since their textbooks are similarly filled with ""thought experiments"" that would more aptly be characterized as ""twin torture"") we were also quite obsessed with the existential implications of how names work, and what happens if they get mixed up. If you do go with the nail polish approach I'd definitely make sure to get a brand that's non-toxic and to not over-do it because little growing nails do need to breathe -- you might want to switch up which nail you paint each time.  Also -- and this is very, very important -- you need to reach an agreement with your partner that neither of you will ever, ever, EVER ""play a joke"" on the other and switch them on purpose. :)"
How to deal with a situation in which following the rules feels like punishment and breaking them is rewarded?,"Our daughter intellectually understands our reasoning and accepted our decision without fuss. But of course she was disappointed and sad on the evening of the party. This is a good outcome and probably the best you can hope for. It's perfectly okay and normal to be sad & disappointed, I would be too. How can we help our children deal with situations where following the rules means that the are being “punished” for doing so while others are blatantly ignoring them and are being “rewarded” for their behavior? By talking with her and NOT phrasing it as ""reward"" and ""punishment"". It's more about doing the ""right"" and the ""wrong"" thing. ""Right"" and ""Wrong"" here are not absolute terms but it means behaving consistently with your own values and goals. There are always things you can do that feel tempting, but you don't do them since it violates your own rules: anything from not driving drunk or lying to staying away from that yummy tub of ice cream in the freezer. Let's look at your example. You can start with a ""goal"" discussion: let her think about how she would phrase goals & guidelines for Covid. You'll probably come up with something like this: ""Our goal for Covid is to stay healthy ourselves and not put other people at risk"". If that's your goal, then she did the ""right"" thing by not going to the party. Other people may behave differently perhaps because they either have other values or goals or they don't have the character or strength to stick to them. That's okay. We don't judge (unless it does harm to someone else). In this case, the other kids took significant risk for themselves but also to other people, so this is questionable behavior. This may have no consequences but it could also result in serious harm to an innocent person. The niece of a friend of ours went to an outdoor bar and got Covid. Now her entire family has it and her father is in the hospital fighting for his life. Sticking to your own goals and values is the best way to go through life. It's not always easy and not always pleasant and things will still go wrong occasionally, but it will result in much more long term happiness."
14 yr old lesbian/bi daughter wanting to have her girlfriend over. What to do?,"I think your approach is correct: dating is dating no matter the gender. You aren't discriminating, you are actually being completely fair.  Children use any edge they can to get you to bend the rules, this is likely one of those cases.

  right to pretend we don't know what's coming? Unless your kids are incredibly dense, they are going to figure it out sooner or later, and probably sooner.  The only question is where are they going to get their information from. I was diagnosed with MS two years ago when my kids were 7, 6, and 3.  My wife and I had to explain what that meant to our kids.  We also had instances of them getting bad information at school. One kid told my 7 year old it meant I was going to die. My advice would be to give a simple explanation and then ask them if they have any questions.  Let them kind of guide you with their questions.  Be honest but don't go into unnecessary details.  Let them know that it is ok to come to you any time they have questions in the future.  As they get older and have an ability to understand more, they will ask more questions."
"If my 4-year-old asks me ""why"", what kind of ""why"" does he mean?","In my experience, he often doesn't know himself what he means.  I've heard a lot of four-year-olds ask ""Why?"" ad infinitum -- sometimes it's just a way of saying, ""Tell me more."" I would suspect that for most four-year-olds, asking ""Why?"" is a way of trying to learn more about the things around them, but I think that they are often looking for a simple explanation that doesn't necessarily answer the question they are technically asking. ""Why is water transparent?"" could mean: ... or any number of other things. If you give an answer to what you think is being asked, you can often tell if you're on the right track by how much the child engages your answer.  If he seems interested in your answer, you're probably on the right track."
Condoms in a care package: Parents advice,"Speaking as a parent, I'm grateful to see this being done by a religious institution. So kudos. To be effective - including against pregnancy and STIs - condoms need to be used and stored in a certain manner. Improper use/storage may lead to undesirable consequences, so it only makes sense to include instructions with the items.  The young adults who receive the care packages usually live in a communal setting (a dorm) and other kids often want to see what the recipient got. In order to avoid potential embarrassment, putting the condoms in a separate, discretely labeled envelope (""Contraception""?) makes sense. To make sure that the recipients don't overlook the envelope, I suggest including in the package a list of contents, and list condoms. That will introduce the recipients to the contraceptives twice. I can't find a study on the effect of including condoms in care packages, but studies indicate the availability of condoms does decrease pregnancy and STIs in young adults. The most common errors include placing the condom upside down and then turning it over (29.1%), taking condom off too soon (28.4%), putting the condom on too late (19.7%), opening the package with a sharp object (10%) and using an oil-based lubricant (6.5%).
School Condom Availability"
How can we motivate a young adult without breaking the family?,"Joe's excellent answer is sufficient in itself. I just wanted to add my experience as a parent (and maybe my experience with troubled kids.) This is one of the hardest phases of parenting: the (nearly) adult child. You love them and want to love them unconditionally, but can't quite draw the line between what's loving and what's best for her. The following is about a sub-group of highly intelligent kids, not all, and I don't know where your daughter falls. It is much more common for a highly intelligent child to fail than most people  realize. The highly intelligent can ""coast"" really well - up to a point. With some in this group, they don't have to work at obtaining knowledge like the rest of us (i.e. get good grades, the ""work"" of childhood); they miss out learning about self-discipline, the value of working hard, persistence, etc. For a lot of them, their self-esteem is fragile because it's not based on their accomplishments or their life skills. And they lack resilience, which is a critical life skill, because they have insufficient experience with difficulties/failure. So when they reach higher grades and can't rely in just intellect to get by, they flounder, a new-ish, very disturbing experience for them. They react to it in different ways. Some accept that they need to learn, belatedly, the importance of work and persistence. Some get depressed and give up. Some blame ""the system"" and do not want to participate in it anymore. Some also turn to self-medicating with alcohol/drugs. Their already shallow self-image/self esteem suffers even more (this relates to victimhood and blame shifting.) All this to say: I've been where you are now, having had a gifted child. The child went from being best at everything to failing ""everything"" in a few short years, while their siblings thrived. I've also interacted with many similar children. Most of those I knew/interacted with were resistant to therapy, but they needed it. However, as Joe said, there isn't much you can do about it, as she is an adult. In the end, we only have control over ourselves. If you haven't worked on a plan with your family therapist beyond survival skills, find a better therapist, because you need one. You need to make a plan that's best for all of you. This will likely involve sitting down with the adult child and having some difficult conversations. It involves boundary setting and compromise, which only works when someone can sit there and tolerate conversations about what is not going well/""working"" in the family, including them and yourselves. You need to let her air all of her grievances and just sit there, no interruptions, and listen, and then she must allow the same. It may take several times to get a pattern of speaking/listening to get it down. It causes a lot of feelings of guilt in the parents dealing with it, and resentment on the child's part. So you need a better strategy and maybe a support system (be it the therapist or therapy + support group). It's possible that I'm only talking about myself here, because this is what I experienced, but if it sounds about right, go for it. Find a good therapist that you feel comfortable with (it might take time.) Then ask them for the name of a good therapist for your child. In my country, therapists can't prescribe drugs if they are indicated, so you might need the help of a psychiatrist or a cooperative family physician. Your gut is telling you she needs a push, and she does. It involves difficult boundaries, e.g. ""You can live here rent free if and only if (you work x hours a week/you are enrolled in x number of for credit classes and maintain passing grades/you are participating in therapy/whatever)."" You know your child, we don't, so this is best worked out with the help of someone who knows about troubled ""youths"", family dynamics, and therapeutic interventions, etc. I can tell you what worked for me and my troubled child, but it wouldn't help, because we are not all the same people. But hang in there. It will get better. There's a high likelihood that it will get worse before it gets better, so, again, hang in there. You're far from alone. Edited to add: Here is a link provided by commenter @Ian. In it, a Harvard trained Psychiatrist explains why gifted kids are actually special needs kids. If you have a gifted child, it's worth a watch. What I can say that might be helpful is that I was a one of these gifted children myself, who floundered badly when I reached the end of my coasting abilities. However, I was in an abusive home - your daughter is not - and staying at home was untenable. I went from failing most of my courses (I failed basic Chemistry and Algebra II twice!) to getting straight A's/graduate school/becoming a Molecular Biologist/Physician (work!!!) because I stumbled on something I loved in a community-college course (the only college I could get into), transferred (on scholastic probation) into a university, and everything changed. I was lucky. My siblings were not. But your daughter has an advantage: parents with education, love and concern. Have courage; this, too, shall pass."
How do you as teacher deal with children who like to hug you?,"I liked @Willow Rex's answer quite a bit, and I think it can solve your problem. However, there's another aspect to your question that I think can be addressed if you so desire. Since you already told the teacher in charge and she dismissed your concerns out of hand, then discuss it with the principal. If you get no results there (they really should take this seriously), I think you can speak with the students directly. Your body belongs to you and no one should touch it without implicit or explicit consent.** If you're averse to hugs, be it for whatever reason, it's a violation of your physical and psychological boundaries when people hug you uninvited. Ten year old girls (unless they are special needs) should have no difficulty understanding this. They were probably told that strangers should not touch them, and no one should touch them inappropriately, so they do understand something about the invasiveness of touching. It's time to expand their horizons (kindly and lovingly) about your discomfort with hugs. They should be aware that their intrusion into personal spaces don't always feel like gifts to the receiver. The next time one of the girls hugs you, ask if you can speak with her alone for a minute (alone meaning in public but where no one else can hear your conversation.) Tell them that while you like them, really enjoy teaching them, and appreciate their affection, you don't feel that hugs are appropriate, and they make you uncomfortable. Again reiterate that you appreciate that they like you, and you like them as well, but a simple ""thank you"" will do if they want to express their appreciation for your attention and your teaching. They are becoming young adults now, and should respect other people's personal space. Finish by telling them you don't want to hurt their feelings, that you enjoy teaching them (and whatever else you can honestly say), but it's no hugs from now on.  They will probably feel embarassed or rebuffed, so pour on the smiles and kind words. Greet them with a smile whenever you see them or when they take leave your class. That should help. Good luck. **I love animals, especially dogs. When I see a dog I'd like to pet, I always ask the owner, ""May I approach your dog?"" Dogs have a personal space, and violating it might mean a nasty bite, or the dog might be a service dog, might be sick, or maybe the dog just doesn't like to be touched by strangers. While most owners say yes, you might be surprised by how many say no. If people should respect a dog's space, it should be obvious that they should respect a person's personal space even more."
"3 year-old boy wants constant attention, hits and deliberately poops in underpants when he doesn't get it","In my opinion, if you aren't willing to consider corporal punishment, you are unnecessarily restricting your options. If you don't believe in it but are willing to consider it, I will present the case for it as my experience shows it to be the most effective method for raising a happy, healthy, well-behaved child while fostering a loving relationship. In my experience, most people opposed to corporal punishment feel that way because it makes them think of angry fathers beating their children with belts until DFS is called and the kids are taken away. That will certainly disadvantage your children and ruin your relationship with them. Consequently, many people have fled to the opposite extreme: only using things like timeouts or taking away privileges. I don't like these because they rely on lengths of time to be effective. Instead of spanking a child's hand for 3 seconds then forgiving them and resuming to love them and play with them, you take away their toy for 30 minutes while they mull over how mean you are for taking their toy and how mad they are at you. I see people all around me using this method and producing children that are disobedient and, more importantly, unhappy. However, there is a third option: do corporal punishment right. Sooner or later, we all have to learn that pooping on the floor is not an acceptable way to handle conflict. If we wait twenty years before addressing this problem, although it may not involve any hand-swatting, it will be much more painful than if we address it decisively at one or two years old by teaching them to associate bad behavior with hand swatting. Here is a simple list of all you need to know for teaching a young child how to handle conflict: If you do this, I bet you will be amazed. It may take a while to sink in but, when they figure out that throwing a fit will get them a swat, they'll stop considering it. Instead of crying when you say ""No juice for now"", they'll continue playing and laughing like before. My wife and I get compliments all the time on how sweet and well-behaved our little girl is and I am certain this is why. Keep in mind that doing this right is simple but not easy. Sometimes you will really not want to get up if they're misbehaving across the room. Sometimes, you may not be sure if they're disobeying or not. However, I am sure that with love, grace, and lots of conscious and deliberate effort, you can do a great job. Note:
Although I have not tried it, I highly doubt this is an effective strategy for raising teenagers. We started doing this when my daughter began throwing fits, hitting, etc around 15-18 months. She is now 21 months and an angel. If your child is old enough to engage in logical, reflective conversation, I would highly encourage that approach first. However, as you have a three-year-old who appears to be out of control, this is what I'd suggest."
My child is ignoring my timeouts and walking away from them. What are some options for handling this?,"Put the child back in timeout and reset the time. Without exception.  Like most other parenting duties this is all about consistency.  Ignore laughing or other such - the child is trying that behavior out to elicit a reaction from you. Stay calm and firm. Don't interact beyond enforcement (that downtime's the point of the time-out, and they may be trying to pass the time in a more entertaining manner with you!). At that age, timeouts don't work unsupervised, you have to be right there. It can be a hassle, but that's parenting."
"How can we discipline a strong-willed, misbehaving 5 year-old?","I'm glad you are concerned with your son's behavior,  it shows you are on the ball and caring.  I am an elementary school teacher (32 years), a parent and grandparent and  suggest you seek professional help.  Two of your comments are especially concerning: The fact that your son, at age five, has difficulty making eye contact can be an indicator of issues which need to be addressed sooner than later.  The second is the fact that your son continues to hurt animals (this is NOT something that most young children do), although you do not say how he hurts them this is a big red flag when working with/caring for children that there are concerns.  I believe you should begin with your pediatrician, be honest with them and they can refer you to a specialist.  "
How can a dad be both a mother and father,"Mothers do what fathers do: love their children unconditionally and raise them to be independent, happy contributing members of society.  My husband and I have different approaches towards the kids, but those are much more based on personality and background than gender.  We both love our kids to death and show them that every day, and we both try to teach them how to live in the world and help those around them in our own way. It sounds like the reading you've done is focused on traditional gender-based roles of parenting, but as I'm sure you know, every family is different.  My parents were kinda reversed; my mom was the disciplinarian, while my dad was the cuddler.  They're still that way with their grandchildren today.  So it's not a gender thing, or even a two-parent thing: it's a personality thing, I believe. Your son may end up with a unique upbringing, but he knows that even if Mom can't communicate like she'd like to, she loves him. And he knows you love him, and that Mom and Dad love each other.  That is the basis for a secure childhood, IMHO. Since your wife can't really communicate her feelings about child-rearing, try to do things from time to time as you believe she would have, especially if it might be counter to how you'd do things.  If you might be tempted to cuddle him when he gets a bump on his knee, while she might distract him by making him giggle, try that.  It'll give you a different perspective on rearing him while hopefully letting your wife know that her perspective and priorities as a parent are still vital to the family as a whole."
How to answer my 4-year-old asking where she was when I was small and how she got in my tummy?,"It's difficult to understand what children are actually seeking as an answer when they ask a question such as this. Since parents know the whole story, it's a challenge to tease out just enough information to satisfy the child without overburdening them. Asking some questions of them about what they think (maybe talking about other species) might give you an idea of what they are actually asking. Most children understand eggs. Almost everything we can see comes from an egg of some kind: insects, birds, turtle, all mammals, etc. It should not be hard to show her a video of, say, a turtle laying eggs and then the hatchlings coming out of the shell. All these animals have the eggs inside of them long before before they grow old enough to start having babies/laying eggs. When the mother is old enough, the eggs are incubated (inside or outside of the body) and develop into what they are meant to become. You have human baby eggs inside of you in a special place in your tummy. That's where she was before she was in the part of your tummy where babies grow until they are born. She was always safe and warm there before she grew into a baby. I told this to my youngest son when he asked, at about your daughter's age. He asked me if his shell was hard or soft. I answered, ""Soft"". That night in his prayers and for many nights after, he started his prayers with, ""Dear God, Thank you that I'm not a smooshy egg."" Somehow this idea disturbed him. So, less than we think is often better with kids."
Should a teenager coming out of quarantine be held responsible to clean up after themself?,"I think it's hard to say exactly what would've been the right approach, because we (and you, probably) don't have all of the details, particularly about how the interaction went when your partner attempted to get him to clean up.  But, some thoughts. First - it's possible, even likely, that the mess seemed too big for him to consider possible to clean up.  This is a common issue we face with our (slightly younger) children, but it's also a problem I have from time to time - it's not unique to children.  I get over it, apply my strategies (map/reduce), but it's possible he doesn't really have the skillset to do that.  Giving him those tools is a critical life lesson; being able to overcome seemingly impossible obstacles by breaking them up into a series of smaller tasks, for example, or simply getting started and seeing the obstacle shrink measurably over time, are vital skills to learn. Second - I certainly think it should've been primarily his job to clean it up.  I'm not sure I'd argue that he should do it alone, both because that might have simply made him give up on an ""impossible"" task, but also because it's important to make it clear to him that he has your (and your partner's) help when he needs it. Help doesn't imply doing everything though, any more than it would in any other circumstance; he needs to take the lead, or at least do the majority of the work.  But he should know you have his back and will help him when he meets a seemingly impossible task. As to how you get to that point (where he does the work) - that seems more herculean of a task to me than cleaning it.  If it were me I'd probably have simply said that he's welcome to come out of quarantine when it's cleaned up, and again offered to help, but limited my input to strictly less than his; if he's not cleaning, then neither am I.  If he simply refuses and leaves the basement, of course, there's not a lot you can directly do, other than whatever you would otherwise do when he's doing something inappropriate.  I'd also consider a legitimate plan on his part to be sufficient to let him leave - as long as he follows through. As far as your partner goes, I would make sure you and they are on the same page - and don't approach them second guessing them; that never works well.  Instead, if you're going to bring it up, bring it up as ""This is clearly a problem [that he doesn't help clean up]; how can we fix it for the future."""
How to explain intravenous drug abuse to a 6-year-old?,"Just be truthful. While the details about chemical addiction may fly over a 6 year old's head, the general idea is really not that hard to understand. Tell them that drugs are chemicals that can make people feel really good, but that may be very unhealthy. Fundamentally, it's like candy and sweets, but far more dangerous (the consequences are more than obesity and tooth decay). This is something a child can easily relate to without making it appear alluring (who would want poisoned candy?)."
How would you explain COVID-19 lockdown to a 4 year old?,"First of all, recognize that your concerns may not be the same as your four year old's concerns. This has two implications: Your child may be worried about things you couldn't have thought of. Your child is likely shielded from or doesn't understand a lot of what's going on, and that can also mean that they don't have access to bits of information that would actually be reassuring. Encourage your child to ask questions about corona, so that they're not left to ponder on their own things that may seem frightening. You are likely worrying about outcomes your child has no thought of. Try not to pass on your own fears to your child. If pre-school is closed and one parent has to stay home from work to care for the child, recognize that this may be viewed as a mainly positive outcome to the child. With my three year old, I emphasize that all closures and restrictions (writing from Sweden, we're not currently in full lockdown) are not - ultimately - to protect us from disease, but to protect our elderly from catching it from us. I find that framing to be appealing because it's both true, and I imagine it's less scary to a young child to hear how we all have to chip in and make sacrifices to protect another group, than to convey an image that it's actually unsafe for them to step outside. Why we should wash our hands and what's so good about vaccines are some things we talk about normally, and the current situation is a good opportunity to put that into context. You can say that it is to avoid this that we vaccinate against a lot of other things, and that scientists are working on a vaccine against this too. That perhaps once your kid will have children of their own, and they will receive a corona vaccine as well in the routine program, and your child will be able to tell their children how they remember what it was like before the vaccine. Washing hands has been a constant battle. Now we've introduced a longer routine, which involves singing a 20-second-long song, and compliance has (temporarily, I assume) increased. Consider whether you are changing your own behavior in a manner which may require explanation. For instance, if you are suddenly buying groceries in conspicuously larger quantities than normal, or even if they may have seen the images of empty shelves, you may want to point out that you and others are trying to reduce your number of trips to the grocery store, and hence the number of chances you may infect some at-risk person, lest they think that you're actually going to run out of food. As an adult, it's easy to become consumed by this. We like to stay updated about what's going on in the world, and this is certainly a main event, and a rapidly evolving one. For my own sake, I could easily bingewatch news for the greater part of the day, and spend the remainder hypothesizing over different future scenarios. Recognize that a young child's world is smaller than yours. Talk about it as a thing that's happening right now, but make sure most of your interactions revolve around normal day to day activities. The above is addressing your question, how to talk about corona, but also make sure you don't talk exclusively about corona."
Is it too dangerous for my 2-year-old son to watch YouTube on the iPad for hours?,"There is sufficient reason, imo, to be concerned. Research findings to date might suggest a correlation between television viewing and developmental problems, but they cannot show causality. Enough, in fact, that the American Academy of Pediatrics has issued a policy statement suggesting that children 2 and older be restricted to no more than 1 to 2 hours of ""high quality"" television a day. Borrowing from a previous answer I posted, here is some relevant research: The concerns are stronger in the area of language development.  This TED talk describes how minimal the impact of television on a toddler's language development is (2% as effective as a real person).  In addition, a television being on generally reduces the amount of language interactions the baby has with the parents, as, at best, both the baby and the parents will be distracted by the television, and at worst the parents will use the television as an opportunity to engage in activities that do not involve the baby. From an AAP media release:"
How can I help a child stay motivated in learning to program?,"First off, in terms of helping the child learn: Many/most schools have computer clubs. Encourage the child to inquire from other students, or ask the school professionals yourself. This will place the child with his peers developmentally, which is the biggest encouragement you can give. Talk to a computer teacher in the school if one exists. They may agree to help the child, or give advice. Similar to #1/#2, advertise for a tutor if you can afford one. A poor but brilliant CS college major may truly enjoy teaching a smart pre-teen, a lot more than less smart age peers they usually tutor. I know I did. The challenge (aside from the fact that you have to pay) is finding someone who's good at teaching - prior teaching or tutoring experience should be asked for, as well as ability to work with younger kids. Online courses (Coursera, etc...) can be great, especially for an interverted nerd (me looks in the mirror) To challenge them point them to Rosetta Code and the Code Review Stackexchange sites. Second, if you feel they could use motivation for next steps: If the child is mature (likely is), show them average pay rates for various professions, and that software engineers are way up compared to most professions. This will make sure that he can look past the usual geek-bullying he is likely to encounter and has reasons to stick to coding. Point out that there are plenty kids like this (as you can see from personal testimonials on almost all answers here :) - he will likely be more encouraged if he doesn't feel like a freak even if he is introverted by nature."
How can I help my child handle peer pressure regarding television?,"Although peer pressure has amazing power in our lives, there are ways to minimize the effect it has on people. It is always important to tell you children what your values are. Explain to them that you value activities over watching TV, or that the non brand name shoes are just as good as the brand name. Also, empower your child to understand that individuality is good. Praise them for being an individual; sometimes this may mean praising them for doing something differently than you would have, as long as it is not harmful, focus on building them up as an individual.  Every year I see students obsessed with being just like ""everyone"" else. They often feel that is how to be valued in the society of their peers. Yet I also see (more and more often) students that know they are different and understand the value in being their own person.  I think there is actually minimal need to be exposed to television to have talking points with their peers. If your child comes to you and says ""everyone else is watching __"" and it is a show you find to be appropriate for your child, there is no harm allowing them to watch it from time to time. However, at the same time if the show, or item in question is something you have no desire for your child to watch/ have, explain to them that although it may be popular, it is not right for your family because... be sure to give them a reason. Providing your child with a clear explanation provides them with something to defend the fact that they have not participated in something others have. To that end, make sure you do not tell them that other kids are bad or wrong - keep it focused on Mom and Dad are responsible for making sure you are exposed to the types of things we want you to be exposed to and it is okay if what our family does is different from your friends. Make sure they are having experiences that they can talk about when asked about their weekend and you would be surprised how quickly going on ""adventures"" or outtings become popular among their peers. "
At what age should you start giving your children pocket money?,"I always tell my kids that I will do my best to take care of them, including using my money to that purpose. They don't need to worry about that.  We started giving an allowance to my oldest at age 7, and we increase it every year on his birthday. This money is really for him to learn with, not because he needs to buy things. At first, he didn't know how to spend it. It piled up in his room for a while. Then he started buying gourmet cake at $5 / slice. His money disappeared in a hurry. Now he is having a valuable lesson about the built-in scarcity of money. I also tell him he has to share whatever he buys with the family that's with him. If I buy a sandwich for myself and my kids are hungry, of course I will share it, so I require the same of him. I still place some restrictions on what he can buy, even though it's his own money. He may not buy a 6-pack of soda and drink the whole thing in a day, for example.  I am very careful to pay allowance without linking it to behavior. Regardless of whether he does his chores, or whether he behaves himself, he always gets his allowance. That's because I believe that paying for behavior is a really bad idea. I've heard of an idea where a kid must put a portion of their allowance in savings, a portion goes to charity, and a portion they can spend. I haven't explored this; I'm just throwing it out there."
Should you pick a baby up everytime it cries?,"Babies cry. Maybe it helps to know what an infant's 'normal"" crying pattern is. Fuss/cry durations peak in the first 2 months (peaking average: 6 weeks), are highest in evenings, and decrease approximately 50% by 12 weeks of age. So, the first two months are the worst. Also, not all infants are alike; some are very compliant, some are very persistent, and there's everything in between. In 1972, two researchers at Johns Hopkins, Silvia Bell and Mary Salter Ainsworth, wrote a seminal parer on infant crying (""Infant crying and maternal responsiveness"") that challenged the (predominantly male espoused) idea that quick response to an infant's cries led to ""spoiled babies"". Further research has supported their conclusion that prompt maternal response to infant crying led to less crying and better language and communication development by the end of the first year. Form the abstract: ...consistency and promptness of maternal response is associated with decline in frequency and duration of infant crying. By the end of the first year individual differences in crying reflect the history of maternal responsiveness rather than constitutional differences in infant irritability. Close physical contact is the most frequent maternal intervention and the most effective in terminating crying. Nevertheless, maternal effectiveness in terminating crying was found to be less powerful than promptness of response in reducing crying in subsequent months. Evidence suggests that whereas crying is expressive at first, it can later be a mode of communication directed specifically toward the mother. The development of non-crying modes of communication, as well as a decline in crying, is associated with maternal responsiveness to infant signals. The findings are discussed in an evolutionary context, and with reference to the popular belief that to respond to his cries ""spoils"" a baby.  How, then, does this myth that letting a baby cry is good for the infant? It seems people confuse cause and effect: they think that a quick maternal response (the ""cause"" rather than the effect"") to a baby's cries trains the baby to cry more often. (Of course a baby will cry again. Babies cry. That's how they communicate. But they do not cry more!) There have been debates in the literature as to exactly what ""secure attachment"" and other variables mean, but in general, the sensitivity to maternal response to crying and infant contentedness has a positive correlation. A 2009 study agreed: This study examined associations between mother–infant nighttime interactions and mother–infant attachment when infants were 12 months old. ...Mothers of securely attached infants had nighttime interactions that were generally more consistent, sensitive and responsive than those of insecurely attached infants. Specifically, in secure dyads [mother-infant pairs], mothers generally picked up and soothed infants when they fussed or cried after an awakening. Whatever the belief, it is clear that human infant crying evolved as a primarily acoustic, graded signal, that it is a fairly reliable, if imperfect, indicator of need for parental care and that its primary function is to promote parental care-giving.  Some pediatricians see evidence that if a baby's crying is ignored, the more compliant baby gives up, stops signaling, becoming withdrawn once realizing that crying is not worthwhile, and (maybe?) concluding that he is not worthwhile. The baby loses the motivation to communicate with his parents, and the parents miss out on opportunities to get to know their baby. The persistent infant (highest-need babies) don't give up, instead crying louder and escalating, making his cries more and more disturbing. This tends to upset parents, who see it as a power struggle. Dr. Sears recommends a middle approach: A quick response when baby is young and falls apart easily or when the cry makes it clear there is real danger; a slower response when the baby is older and begins to learn how to settle disturbances on his own. However it is handled, I agree that is it not possible to spoil a young baby. When a baby is older and can be taught to self-soothe, it's more appropriate to respond to different cries differently.

How to handle my little brother's addiction to videogames?,"This is anecdotal but...
Throughout highschool my life was: wake-up, go to school, come home, game, go to bed, repeat. As I developed other hobbies, I did those instead of gaming. As money to buy things (new games, clothing, etc) became important to me, I did chores around the house and kept my grades up (an A at the end of the term was worth $5, a B+: $4, B: $3.50, and so on down to a C which was only worth $1 and nothing less was worth any money). Hygiene is important and he needs to know this, but there were also days when I was simply a stinky teenager who didn't shower at all. (Hell, there were whole WEEKENDS when I didn't leave the house or shower.) There is nothing wrong with an OCCASIONAL weekend of being gross (dental hygiene is always important though). He won't melt or start growing moss. I remember once my sister complained to my dad ""Daaaaad, she smells... make her take a shower!"". Developing other interests and a sense of responsibility would be the main things to focus on. Grades can lead to a good job and a better future. Dental hygiene will prevent cavities and nasty trips to the dentist for fillings. I think completely cutting him off will only make him see the person who does the cutting off as an enemy to be fought instead of an ally to be worked with,. Compare this to the situation of someone who loves books and does a lot of reading: they are still just sitting around doing something, but likely if he spent the same amount of time reading, no one would care. People have odd attitudes about computer games sometimes.  To get him out of the house and doing physical activity: you and/or your dad or his mom can ask him to accompany them: go to throw a frisbee or kick a ball around, go for a bike ride together, go for a hike, etc.  edit: Both exercise, hobby development and better homework habits could perhpas be improved with [more] parental involvement. You didn't mention if there is any parental involvement beyond ""go out and play."", ""do your homework."" etc. But having a parent sit down with him and keep him company and assist when he gets stuck in his homework may make a world of difference. Perhaps the botched homework assignments are not as much a factor of the gaming as they are of struggling to understand the material but perhaps they are due to rushing to game. Having a parent nearby to gently remind him to take an extra few minutes to think things though and perhaps check accuracy before letting him on the comp could really help. Having a parent invite him to help make dinner, or join them in one of their hobbies can expose him to other things he may not realize he would enjoy. Also, having a parent come and play with him can help them learn more about what he is doing and why he enjoys it as well as help in building a better relationship which could then be leveraged to invite him to do other things with them. You mentioned that the game he plays in Minecraft and you wanted to get him interested in Software design. That is PERFECT! For starters, there is a HUGE (and I mean MASSIVE) community built up around creating mods for minecraft. These mods add SO MUCH content. One of them (ComputerCraft) actually adds the ability to program in Lua from within the Minecraft game. This yields two options: get him playing with Lua code in Minecraft, and/or get him learning Java to write his own mods for the game! (Learn Java before trying to write a mod; MinecraftForge is a large, complicated framework not very friendly to beginners.) (edit):
I forgot to add: I'm a young, happily married engineer who landed a good job right out of university. Playing video games for 8-10 hours every evening throughout highschool has not left any negative impacts on my ""future"". Carrying an oversized backpack and purse did more to wreck my posture and back than gaming did. I have an (over) active social life, and sometimes that involves myself, my husband and some friends (who are also successful and have families and careers) spending the whole evening playing video games... (we just spent the entire weekend playing an EXTREMELY heavily modded version of Minecraft actually) and there is nothing wrong with that :) Too much gaming CAN be a bad thing, but not always. Be careful that in trying to find a balance that YOU (and your dad) are happy with, you don't swing the pendulum too far the other way and prevent him from doing one of his favorite hobbies which could instead be turned into an awesome tool to teach programming. If he is playing on a server, it is also possible that he has friends online that he plays with, so take this into account too. Edit again: Something to consider though... if he is gaming instead of sleeping, it would be reasonable to enforce no gaming after a certain time. He is old enough that I think this should be a conversation that he participates in instead of something that is dictated. But should still be kept within reasonable hours. Perhaps something like ""no electronics for 30 min before bed"" with the internet cut off at some hour after that, and only turned on at a certain time in the morning to help enforce healthy sleep habits. One more edit:
There is a game called ""Code Combat"" that teaches coding in a game situation. It could be worth looking into. From what I have played of it, it is in the form of: ""type this to make the little dude fight the monster"", ""use what you learned about how to fight the monster to get through this puzzle""."
Why do I have negative feelings about my mother?,"I don't think you hate your Mother as strongly as you think you do. We always get angry with those that are near us. It seems to be the easiest way to vent. I remember being 16 and the reason why is because it was one of the hardest times of my life. Seeing abuse, anger, hate, and finally a divorce is never easy and it stays with you so you have my sympathies here. My advice is think long and hard about what would happen if you push your Mother away and live on your own. It's hard out there on your own and it's even harder when you push those around you away. It would be wise to try and speak to your Mother about this properly. If you are struggling, consider writing down everything you can think of that is causing you anger and pain. Put it all down on paper and read over it. Maybe put together a letter for your Mother to read. She doesn't have to see it though if you don't want her to. Writing things down can be a way of dealing with things. It would also be very good to write down all the positives that are happening in your life. This gives you something to be happy about, something to recognise and something to focus on. Seeing a psychiatrist may be another option or simply talking to someone may be enough. He's a little story that through my own experience may help you. I never had a Father figure in my early years, he, and my Mother split when I was a few months old and although I know of him I don't speak to him. I really wanted one when I was young and I felt like I wasn't normal because I didn't have one. My Mother met somebody when I was around 11. They were together 5 years, married 3. He turned out to be an abusive alcoholic and at one point it was really bad. He worked offshore and so every other month he wasn't around. When they split, I was happy. It felt like we were a family again. We moved to another house and we got on but as I grew up, for some strange reason I started to not get on with my Mother. I became to dislike her and I couldn't explain why at the time. It got so bad that we would shout and fight for hours before one of us stormed off. I ended up leaving and getting my own place. That's when reality set in. I'd push the one person who loved me the most away and I'd done some real damage in doing so. I was now on my own, living a house that I couldn't afford and I couldn't turn to my Mother for help. It got to the point that I was pulling out loans to try and make ends meet and I couldn't afford to pay them back. I ended up living with my Grandmother for a period of time. During this time I had a long hard think about what I'd done. Over the years my Mother sacrificed everything for me and my sister. Holding three jobs just to make ends meet and to put food on the table. She would even go without just so we wouldn't. She wasn't perfect but she did her best and that's all she can do. I thought to myself, what have I done? Why have I pushed her away? Honestly I still don't know but I bet it's something to do with the divorce. I put that behind and I made an effort to reach back out to her to thank her for everything she had done and to tell her that I know she always had my best interest at heart. I moved back in and although there was tension, I tried my best to not get angry again. Instead I focused on saving my money so that I could eventually move out and become independent with the support of my Mother behind me. I was 22 when I moved out with a full time job. Even then it was hard so think carefully before moving out. 10 years on I now have my own child and my relationship with my Mother is closer than ever because of the effort I put back in."
What age is it appropriate to start martial arts?,"The appropriate age depends a great deal on the specific style/art in question, the type of dojo, and the particular child.  Most Karate dojos I know take kids starting around age 4-6.  Most Krav Maga dojos I know won't take anyone under 14-16; some won't take minors at all.  My friend's Brazilian Jui-Jitsu dojo only takes kids from age 10, but I'm told that most are willing to start younger than that. Assuming an appropriate level of kid-friendliness in the selected dojo, a child is generally ready for martial arts study when he or she: What art/style you choose for your child is not nearly as important as what dojo and Sensei you choose.  Some dojos just aren't set up to teach children well.  Others are good with older kids, but lack the special awsomesauce that reaches young students. Here are some traits that make a dojo great for children under 10: Has plenty of incremental rewards.  Small children can't just look at the change in their body mechanics and know they've made progress -- they need to be told.  While a dojo that uses no displays of ranks, or a simple white/black belt system can be wonderful for adults and mature teens, that is an inadequate level of reinforcement for primary school children.   A program well-suited to the youngest students uses patches, colored belts, achievement stripes, a wall chart, a log book, or some other concrete indication to your child when progress has been made.  For very young children, there should be some indication of achievement that they can earn at least every 1-2 weeks.  This way they know when they have accomplished something, and they internalize that things like focus and practice are good strategies. The sensei uses real (and not-so-real) world examples kids can relate to.  ""We use four fingers in a split-finger eye strike in case we miss slightly, or in the event of attack by a four-eyed monster!"" The sensei is patient and pays attention to the individual children. The sensei teaches not only martial arts skills, but appropriate lessons on when they should or shouldn't be used. The sensei incorporates games into classes that include small children.  Karate dodge ball, jump the noodle, kickpad leapfrog, and so on make learning fun (and give kids a chance to watch the grown-ups in the class look ridiculous). The sensei groups students primarily by rank/progress, so that everyone is challenged at their own level.  (This isn't to say that there are no ""adults only"" classes, but that a 7th kyu student doesn't experience slowed progress due to being grouped predominantly with 9th kyu age peers.) The dojo community shares values that mesh well with your family's values. This, of course, is all in addition to the things that make a good dojo in general."
How to respond if my child is picked on by other children?,"Teach your child not to be an easy target.  Bullies go for easy prey, someone with confident body language, who can tell the bully to ""knock it off"" in a firm voice, etc. is a less likely target.  Also, being with a group of friends whenever possible is another good strategy. Teach your child to defend him/her self and others when needed.  Tattling on a bully just teaches them to not get caught, and they may not give your child the chance to tattle before harm is done.  Every living thing has the right to defend itself.  Additionally, martial arts classes can help your child develop the confidence that will help him or her not be a target to begin with. Note: some schools have adopted a ""no tolerance"" policy such that a child who defends him/her self from a physical attack receives the same punishment as his/her attacker.  It's hard to do, but prepare your child for this possibility and make sure they know you'd prefer to stand by them through a suspension than have them hurt. If this is happening when you are around, just be observant.  Most bullies don't want to be caught by adults.  It is NOT wrong to step in if you see a child bullying others.  Correct the child in a loud, firm voice.  Their parent should step in, but if they don't want to, embarrassing them will usually do the trick. If this is happening at the school, make sure the school knows about it, and that you will not accept taking privileges away from your child in the name of avoidance as a solution.  The easiest thing for the school to do is to keep your child away from the bully -- but this rewards the bully (with a sense of power over your child) and teaches your child that he/she is the one who is wrong.  The only answer is to change the bully's behavior or remove the bully from the situation. Make sure your child has a number of healthy friendships.  Especially if the group he/she is with at school is a problem, let him/her try different sports or hobbies with other kids until he/she slides into a comfortable social group.   Remember: the worst part of bullying has nothing to do with harsh words or hard fists.  It's about powerlessness, lack of confidence in one's own worth, and isolation.  You combat that by giving your child power over the situation, and good friends he/she shares common interests with, and opportunities to build confidence."
How do you decide if a movie is suitable for young children?,"Common Sense Media is an incredible resource for this purpose. It provides parent-focused overviews and specific details about scenes that contain both desirable and undesirable activity.  Movies are rated for age appropriateness and in each of the following categories: Desirable Undesirable You can also look up movies by age-appropriateness. In addition, there are website, app, tv, book, music, and game reviews on the site. Here is a quick review for ""Gone With The Wind"", which is rated G: "
Does scaring children really traumatize them?,"I can't find any research on this typical but stepped-up-a-level game of peek-a-boo.   I think you have to go with your gut on this one. If any child seems to overly react, then likely you are overdoing it. If you are actually trying to scare a child, we'd have to ask why, but this doesn't seem to be the case or you would not be asking. I suggest taking the time after a wee scare to ask the child if they like the game. At four and five, they are well capable of telling you if they don't or if they do like it. Kids are individuals, maybe one does and the other doesn't. I had an uncle that tickled me. I hated it and frequently asked him to stop -- but while laugh-shrieking . Finally I stood up to him in front of the family and told him I hated the tickles and to please stop. He did. So, sometimes children can be afraid to tell you they don't like the game, but asking in a quiet moment can 'fix' that."
How to help my son improve without being discouraging?,"The root cause of your child's frustration is expecting to make complex things perfectly without a long process of trial and error. I suggest that the best long-term solution is to offer the child a more realistic version of what to expect on the path to mastery of most skills. All of the attempts to logically persuade the child are best done in the ""cold"" state - not when the child is frustrated by the imperfection of his results. Give real-life examples of how much time, effort, incomplete prototypes and failures it took you, other relatives and friends, in order to master their skill. Ditto for real-life examples of early work and/or the long and difficult path to success  it took for well-known artists, inventors, scientists, etc. See some examples below, and there are plenty of others. Praise the effort, not the the fact the the child is ""good"" at something (for example, skillful, smart, etc). See the works by Carol Dweck and colleagues on ""growth mindset"" below, as well as the NOTE. In your specific case (working on miniatures): Take a few steps back and restart with the most simple miniatures that your child can complete on his own. Do a joint project where the child can successfully complete a few small parts on his own (and you do the rest). The last suggestions are inspired by some of the learning methods used by artists, scientists and engineers. REFERENCES: [Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone ] was submitted to twelve

Just found out my daughter might be gay. Now what?,"First, ask yourself honestly: would you react the same way if it were a friend of the opposite gender?  Or is part of your reaction based on gender and gender preference?  If it is, step away from this and get hold of yourself first.  She's 14 and learning about herself.  She has a first crush; do you remember your first love?  It seems all-encompassing at the time to the persons involved but it will not permanently change anything about the daughter you have raised and love. And do not go to the other parents unless you fear something illegal (drugs, criminal behavior) is going on.  A first crush between teenagers is perfectly normal and natural and not something to freak out over.  Make this a huge deal and you will likely get the opposite response that you're looking for; the girls will stick together and get secretive, and you will have built a nice thick wall between you and your daughter that could take years to break down. If you need some face-to-face perspective, try finding a local group of PFLAG for support   (Parents, Families, & Friends of Lesbians and Gays). 
And I strongly recommend listening to Dan Savage's podcast; he's had several episodes of kids coming out to their parents and how it can affect everyone, and that can give you an idea of how to proceed."
How can 7-year old defend himself when toddler is hitting?,"My daughter is 16 months (the ""terrible twos"" begin in the second year of life, remember) and we've always been conscious about discouraging, politely but firmly, any behaviors that cause physical injury. She may not understand all of the words we say, but a firm ""no"" is pretty well-ingrained as a signal that she's about to get plunked in her crib for 15 minutes if she doesn't stop whatever she's doing, whether that's pulling hair, slapping faces, pinching noses, scratching cheeks, wailing for no reason, etc. Your 7-year-old, on the other hand, can definitely understand you. So talk to him. Tell him that he has the right to protect himself from injury and to protect his things from damage. The way he does so, however, should not be violent. He shouldn't strike back; that just reinforces her behavior as being acceptable. If she's hitting him for no reason, he can start with a firm ""no"" and if she keeps hitting him he has the right to block her punches and, in the extreme, to gather her up in a bear hug until she calms down. If she's banging a delicate and valuable (to him) toy around on the floor, walls and on him, perhaps it's time to put that toy away in a place she can neither see it nor get to it, and bring out something sturdier (and perhaps softer). At the end of the day, you cannot control how your friend raises her daughter. You can control how you raise your son. Teach him to be an assertive but nonviolent person, who stands up for himself."
Why is trying to talk children out of how they feel a bad idea?,"Adding to the other good answers and elaborating a bit on the ""why"" from the child's perspective: The advice is based on the concept of Mirroring in psychology. It means that a parent acknowledges the emotion of the child (verbally or non-verbally), e.g.: I can understand that you are sad. (Meaning that it is okay to feel this way) Let us see if we can do something about this situation. (Dealing with the situation and the emotion) Dismissing a child's emotion as wrong results in a conflict between the child's perception (""I feel sad"") and the parent's declaration that the child should not feel this way (""It's just a stupid toy!""). Emotions that are not mirrored or even rejected (think: fear, lust, anger) will be dissociated and the child will adapt to it, and negate them in turn. Insecurity and doubt about how and what a child is feeling might make it harder for them to care for themselves and identify the cause of their agitation. If emotions are mirrored, the child is able to validate the feeling and develop self-perception and awareness for their own emotional life, as well as tools with how to deal with those feelings."
How to help my 2.5-year-old daughter take her medicine when she refuses to?,"I don't like using strength or force to do things, and I am afraid to cause fear or trauma on my little one This dislike of using force speaks for you. However, in this case, it might be the only thing that is guaranteed to be sucessfull in getting her to take her medicine, and it's in her interest, even if she doesn't understand it. This is what parents are for. Sometimes acting in a child's best interest means acting against what they want; this can be emotionally draining, but it's necessary. Don't be too afraid of causing trauma. You're not abusing her, you're not being mean, and you have to trust that your relationship with your daughter is built on a solid, loving foundation that will survive these times of conflict. That said, maybe there are some things you can try so that in the future you won't have to resort to force any more. I think the most important thing in that respect is to be consistent so she knows exactly what she can expect. First, don't argue or discuss with her when it's time to take her medicine. She needs to take it. There is no way around that, and you should make that clear to her. Arguing with her, discussing it with her, trying to reason with her etc will give her the impression that taking the medicine is negotiable. Provide her with just two options: Either she takes the medicine willingly, or you'll force her to take it. When she doesn't take it willingly, follow through immediately. There really aren't any other options, and it's better to have a horrible 30 seconds than dragging it out to a horrible ten minutes.  Once she's taken / been forced to take the medicine, soothe her. It goes without saying that if she's taken it without being forced, you praise her (@Pere suggests to praise her in any case, to reinforce the positive aspect of taking the medicine - I haven't tried this myself, though). Second, find out whether there is something you can do to make the taking of the medicine less difficult for her. Talk to her about it when it is not time to take it. Giving her as much control as possible might help. For example, maybe you can give her control about the time when to take it. (Before a meal? After a meal?) Suggest some things you think might make it easier, like offering that she holds the spoon with the medicine herself, that she takes it in multiple small doses (if that's possible and allowed) or, if she's like me, in one big gulp so it's over quickly, or that she gets to eat a banana right after swallowing it, or that you tell her a story right afterwards (but again, make it very clear that there is no way around taking the medicine - that's a given). It's possible, though, that giving her some control over the process won't work because she simply doesn't care about any of that. Third (because this is beyond your control), maybe there is a product with an identical active ingredient that tastes different. It's worth a shot to check. To summarize: Offer her some control over the means and context, but remain firm and unshakable about your requirement that she takes the medicine. Kids are very good at learning patterns. Once she understands there really isn't a way around the horrible medicine, she might be more open to the question of how she takes it. I hope you won't have to resort to force for much longer."
How to explain to a 9-year-old why a relative is not welcome,"I would provide much less information to your children than you have listed here. It would go something like this.  Until Nana agrees to help me protect you from Uncle Joe, I can't leave you at her house or let her take you places. It's really sad; I'm sad about it and I want you to have Nana time. I'm telling you about Uncle Joe so you understand I'm not being mean, and I'm not mad at Nana. "
Do most 2-3-year-old toddlers deliberately disobey?,"If you research ""toddler noncompliance"" (meaning disobedience), there is a wealth of information. Part of the reason so much information exists is because it is a common concern of parents, and so there's a need/desire to understand it. One of the factors that influences the child's seemingly sudden increase in disobedience in toddlerhood is the change in the parents' approach to reprimanding or disciplining the child:  Developmental analyses of maternal control strategies indicated a shift from the physical to the verbal modalities with age. Maternal explanations, bargaining, and reprimands increased with age and distraction decreased with age. Developmental changes in children's responses to control were consistent with a social skill perspective on children's noncompliance. Passive noncompliance and direct defiance decreased with age, whereas negotiation, the relatively more sophisticated form of resistance, increased with age. Mothers' use of reasoning and suggestion were associated with the children's use of negotiation as a form of resistance, whereas relatively direct maternal strategies were associated with the children's defiant responses.1 There have also been some interesting studies on other negative behavior seen in children, such as lying about breaking a rule.  In Study 1, 3- and 5-year-olds were asked not to touch a toy in the experimenter's absence. Just over half of the children touched the toy, and of those children, the majority denied having done so. Of control children who were given permission to touch the toy, all touched it and admitted having done so. In Study 2, 3- and 5-year-olds were asked not to look in a box to identify its contents. Almost all children looked, most denied having looked, and a minority consistently feigned ignorance of the contents. False-belief understanding was linked to denial of looking but not to feigning ignorance. Of control children who were given permission to look, all acknowledged looking, and they almost always revealed their knowledge of the contents. The studies confirm that preschoolers deceive in the context of a minor misdemeanor but are less effective at feigning ignorance.2 To me, this suggests that the behavior isn't completely due to the change in the parents' methods, but a sign that a child is acquiring a simplistic moral framework. They're aware of right and wrong in a limited enough sense to deny when they've done wrong, but are not yet advanced enough to know that lying is wrong. (Or, that adults can easily tell when such a lie has occurred.) So, yes, the disobedience is quite normal in toddlers, and doesn't seem to be constrained to any given country. It's so normal that this stage of life has a well-known name: The Terrible Twos (or Threes) “Research shows that age three is the peak of defiant behavior,” says Kazdin. You're more controlling (you have to be—he's a force of nature now!), but he wants autonomy desperately, which makes life a series of battles. And your child is up for it: That improved reasoning lets him enter into high-level negotiations (“I'll put on my pajamas now if you give me a piece of chocolate”)."
How to teach a 3yo to endure during hikes?,"Could it be that those ""few hours walk in the woods"" exceeded her range (both in physical endurance and attention span) pretty much from the get-go, so you ended up always carrying her towards the end of the hike? (I got kids age 12 and 8 who get bored of a ""hike"" in much less than ""a few hours"". They can run around the playground, and do visits to the museum or the zoo for almost a whole day, but a ""plain"" hike would bore them witless.) If your kid never experienced ""making it through"" a hike, thus making the hike itself something to take satisfaction in, she won't be eager to put significant energy into it, and will ask to be carried as soon as she feels like she's exerting herself -- because, what is the point in walking longer if, in the end, you'll carry her anyway, and she'll still get to look for fairies or explore the playground? I think the trick here is to start small, let her achieve ""completion"" on a regular basis, and then extend things as her endurance, attention span, and willingness to exercise herself increases as she grows up. One thing more, I don't think the average three-year-old needs artificial ""workout"" or ""exercise"". Usually their play instinct has them moving around pretty much non-stop anyway, inside or outside the house, and they have a rather fine-tuned feel for when they want to move, and when they want to rest. IMHO, it's better not to tamper with that too early in their life, but instead heighten their awareness for what their body tells them. Plus, physical strain (which we grown-ups would label ""exercise"", ""training"", or ""workout"") can easily be actively harmful to young kids. Their bodies are already developing rapidly towards greater strength and endurance, at huge stress to their system, without any additional ""load"" from us adults."
When should you start talking with your children about sex?,"Make discussions age appropriate.  Scale up the detail as they get older.  NEVER LIE TO THEM.  Just leave out details. My kids were all born about 3 years apart.  This left ample time for each of the previous children to ask questions typical of their age group.  Answering their question on the same level is always best. An almost-3-year-old asking, ""how does the baby get out of your tummy?"" probably doesn't warrant details on the labors and pain of ordeal.  Rather, ""a doctor helps get the baby out,"" will suffice a typical 3-year-old. My 6-year-old daughter was keen enough to ask how the baby gets in there in the first place.  This was answered by a basic discussion of the mechanics of sex, followed by, ""you have to be this tall and married.""  However, she has always been fascinated with biology, and wants (and probably will become) a veterinarian.  So, she already had investigated things on her own accord, like development stages of the baby, knew that ""moms have eggs"", and asked ""how many eggs do you have?""  (We consulted Google -- about 3 million eggs, but only about 300 become active.)  So, we answered her questions as they arose.  She understood these things, but not how the whole process was initiated. At 10-11 years old, a child should be fully aware of the maturation process, because, ""weird things start happening to your body.""  They need to know that it's normal, and why it is happening. Using proper names and terminology is important, too.  You may need to look up the names of things (I assume you're not a physician), and/or look up some diagrams to review with them, if you deem it appropriate.  After all, a picture is worth 1,000 words. Springing the entire subject on them all at once is not a good idea.  Initiating a discussion that immediately delves into the subject will make them feel awkward and/or embarrassed.  Talking through the facts openly, without showing embarrassment, is important; because it shows them that sex is not a bad thing, and is a natural part of life.  They will feel much more comfortable about asking their own questions, too.  Setting expectations about sex is also important.  Let them know your opinion of an appropriate time for them to become sexually active (no sex before marriage, etc.).  Discussion your opinions of birth control should also be held. If you feel you need to have a discussion with your child, you may try gently steering a private conversation to the subject.  If they don't want to talk about it just then, don't force the issue.  Do, however, attempt to revisit the topic that evening or the next day.  It's important to eventually talk.  Ask your share of questions, too. With knowledge comes responsibility.  Don't let them become irresponsible through ignorance. You'll do a great job!"
"How to instill scepticism towards authority, albeit in a healthy way?","""Healthy disrespect"" for authority has a wide definition.  Based on your question, I'm going to define it as ""not accepting blindly what authority figures tell him, but not doing it in a way that explicitly defies the authority in a confrontational way"".  Basically, not automatically trusting authority figures, but not being a jerk about it. First - I'm not sure it's a great idea to lie to encourage this.  He'll figure out what you're doing, and that'll backfire on you.  What you're doing seems like one good approach, though; just modify it from lying to him, to asking him to prove his statement, and asking ""What about..."" things that turn out to be wrong/irrelevant but make him question his approach.  That's really the same thing, just without the lying.  Lying to him is only going to make him distrust you, not authority figures in general - authority figures are very different from parental figures, in important ways: parental figures are much more inherently trusted as ""safe"", generally. Learning to think analytically is the key here, though: and that's exactly what you're teaching him to do by questioning his answers. Not taking anything as given, but considering its source and its veracity.  Push back on statements-of-truth from him, and he'll learn to do the same to you and other authority figures. I have a child in roughly the same category - pretty similar level of math skills, almost same age.  I have I suspect the opposite problem: helping him learn to respect authority figures in a way that is appropriate.  He automatically disrespects authority figures, as he's confident he knows better than they do (myself included, for the most part).  That's a big challenge with some gifted children: convincing them that sometimes other people do know more than they do. For him, I try to talk through why people are doing what they're doing, and help him to think through their possible reasoning.  This should be effective for children on both sides of the issue here; understanding why someone else says and does what they do is important for developing empathy, and for accepting why people might do things that are not what the child would prefer (assign homework, have a pop quiz, ask them to sit down, call on other children...) Learning how to recognize someone who has a position of authority for a good reason is important, from both sides of this.  A person should learn to take different inputs to determine how much respect is appropriate for a person: start with a position based on their authority level plus an uncertainty level, then lower that uncertainty level as they learn more about them and adjust the position accordingly.  It's just like a statistical problem: define your prior, then test it using Bayesian inference. Person: Calculus teacher.  Prior: Likely knows math well given position. First month, teacher effectively explains L'Hôpital's rule, seems to go into depth. Adjust respect up some, adjust uncertainty down. Second month, teacher incorrectly grades problem set, acknowledges issue and corrects.  Adjust respect up some (but be more careful with grading), adjust uncertainty down Etc. ... and maybe the opposite if the teacher is not so good! If your child is able to understand this kind of thinking, then perhaps this is an effective approach to explain to him. Finally - modelling is the most important thing I think you can do at this age.  Model both how to correctly question authority figures, and how to give deference when it's appropriate.  Talk about it afterwards if it seems particularly interesting."
I don't want to be an involved grandparent. How do I let my son know?,"I have small children now, but I can imagine that I will feel the same when I become a grandparent. When I had my first baby, I assumed that my mom will take care of him. I asked her, and she said yes. Maybe she didn't realize what it meant or truly overestimated herself, but it was obvious in a couple of weeks that she was way over her head. We hired a nanny, it did not work out so well (various reasons), and we placed the kid in a day care, and have been happy.  Since you seem to be clear, it will help them plan if you are frank with them. Maybe meet only your son and ask what their plans are, and tell him what you can offer. Maybe you can supervise a nanny, maybe you can drive the baby to/from day-care, maybe you can offer an occasional evening/weekend when you are around, maybe you can offer dinner one or two times a week, maybe you just like to visit occasionally. Since a baby is involved, let there be no assumptions on either side. Have that talk ASAP."
"My 2-year-old son supervises me after asking me to do something for him, does this suggest lack of trust?","Children learn how to do things by imitating, so much of this is simple curiosity. (""How does the milk go in the bottle? Does it happen the same way every time? WOW."") But toddlers also start to realize they are independent and have some control over their world.  I wouldn't perceive this as a lack of trust, necessarily. Rather, he is checking that you fulfill his request. I imagine that there are times you refuse unreasonable requests (such as too many sweets or staying up late), and so he's trying to learn what you will and won't do for him. Edited to add: I'm also realizing (from other comments and from considering my toddler's behavior) that part of it is imitating parenting. For example, if you tell him, ""Let's go into this room,"" do you look to see that he's following? He's decided that's an expected part of the process, and therefore watches you! Earlier this afternoon I was filling a sippy cup for my son, and he said ""Oh, good job, mommy,"" (the same inflection I use towards him!) and patted me on the shoulder when I handed him the cup. "
Helping teenage son to get over his crush,"Be supportive.  Be there for him.  And be willing to just listen.  He doesn't need you to fix it for him (not like you could anyway).  He just needs someone to talk to and be supportive.  Listen first.  And only give advice once he's asked / stopped talking.  Let him do most of the talking.   Only he can really get over it.  It will just be easier if he knows you love him and will help him in any way you can. (If you want to initiate the conversation, you could start by asking what's bothering him and if he'd like to talk about it.  He may not want to, yet.  But if he knows you want to listen, he may open up later.  Just don't push him.)"
What are the objective arguments against immunizations for infants and children?,"TL;DR: No Update Sept 2015: Aaron Carroll more clearly and expertly answers this in his New York Times analysis ""Not up for Debate: the Science behind Vaccination"". Most of the talk lately has been about how the evidence for a link between autism and MMR vaccination is fraudulent.  So, there is no scientific research that demonstrate that contemporary vaccines are harmful, with the exception of allergic reactions (commonly egg protein) and some minor side effects (fever, headache, sore arm, tears, ...). Since even minor side effects can be serious for some populations, some vaccines are not given to all patients (e.g. those who are too young, old, sick, and/or allergic; CDC Flu Vaccine Summary for Clinicians). There is substantial evidence that vaccines keep people from contracting serious viruses and chronic diseases. For example, a series of interactive graphics from the Wall Street Journal makes this clear, like this one showing the decline in measles following the introduction of a vaccine:  image credit: Ben Moore It is not possible to conclude that a vaccine will have no negative effects on health, but it is easy to estimate the probability that the net effect will be overwhelmingly positive. Vaccines are definitely not inert - otherwise they would not work. So, on the pro-vaccine side, there are many lives saved and many lives improved. On the anti-vaccine side there are minor side effects and presently undetectable and unnoticeable 'unknowns'. For the sake of being thorough, the risks of (""hospital-acquired infections"") and using needles (Guidice and Campbell, 2006) are accepted as risks that are outweighed by the benefits of receiving health care. While I can find no compelling objective arguments against vaccinating children, Dr. Sears provides a comprehensive and well referenced overview of the arguments in ""The Vaccine Book"". Dr. Sears proposes the possibility that it would be in the public health interest to give some vaccines at later ages and / or more spread out through time, e.g., so that a child only receives one or two in any visit. One example he gives is to question the practice of giving 1-2 day old newborns a vaccine for Hepatitis B - which is transmitted sexually and through shared needles - because the risks of a Hep B vaccine for infants and toddlers are greater than the extremely low rates of Hep B at this age, given the fact that a child of a few months or a years would be better able to tolerate the vaccine than an infant. However, Offit and Moser (2009) suggest that Dr. Sears under-estimates the risk of Hep-B by misrepresenting previous work (they also point out other flaws in the Sears Vaccine book).

What should I do if my 15 year old son is sexually interested in younger boys?,"Pedophilia is a sexual orientation. He is not a bad person just for having this orientation (any more than any other orientation), and that needs to be made clear to him. Not all pedophiles are child molesters and not all child molesters are pedophiles. Your candor, love, and support are going to be incredibly important to him, and his courage in facing this with you, as others have mentioned, is incredibly commendable. Your son is a remarkable person. He deserves sympathy and respect. Has he acted on his attraction? (You need not answer.) You need to talk about this. Not all pedophiles do, and if he has not, he has done nothing wrong or illegal. Although there is growing awareness in the field of psychotherapy about pedophilia, it is still largely not well-understood, but it is important that he start therapy. Finding a good therapist is going to be difficult, and pre-screening will be necessary.** There is still a fear in the community that reporting a pedophile is mandatory. It is not. It is only mandatory to report someone if the therapist has a strong suspicion that the patient will harm someone by acting on his attraction. Find someone who knows the difference, or can recommend to you to someone who does.  Read together about pedophilia written by sympathetic sufferers, i.e. people who know that they are pedophiles, but have made a moral decision not to act on their desires. These people understand that any interaction with child pornography is contributing to child abuse. It is not merely a matter of illegality (albeit it is a seriously life-altering prohibition); all child pornography involves the exploitation of a minor, unable to give moral and/or legal consent, for sexual purposes.** If your son feels the same way, or can recognize this (I suspect he does already), he will be more amenable to treatment. Many young male pedophiles also have sexual attractions to people closer to their own ages. A good therapist will explore this to see if it is the case, and can work with this. The orientation probably will not be changed, but it might be mitigated. There are a few internet support groups for pedophiles who wish to live lives free of child abuse in any form. Virtuous Pedophiles is one such group. Their FAQ pages and their reading lists are very helpful.  From their page: We are not an organization for people who want to debate whether sex between children and adults should be legal. We are united in our belief that sexual activity between adults and children is wrong. ...[W]e can resist the temptation to abuse children sexually... Although one of the goals of the website is to reduce the stigma attached to pedophilia by letting people know that a substantial number of pedophiles do not molest children, your son (who should keep this between himself and his parents) can still benefit from their ability to provide peer support and information about available resources to help virtuous pedophiles remain law-abiding, and lead happy, productive lives. It's obvious that you love your son and want the best for him. Please know that there are other parents and children in your respective shoes. ** Before revealing the situation, you should ask the therapist about the conditions under which he or she would break confidentiality and notify the police or others. You should be able to ask confidentiality-related questions over the phone before making an appointment or even revealing your name. Also, a therapist who helps your son to avoid detection from illegal activity is not a true therapist at all. ** Virtual child pornography is illegal, and has not been shown scientifically to help pedophiles (it may be harmful). It needs to be avoided. This American Life 522: Tarred and Feathered

Pedophilia: Is There a Duty to Report?"
What are some suggestions for punishing a child? [closed],"Our kids push boundaries, alot! My husband and I have tried everything for punishment and have settled on this: bad behavior = corner...immediately Simple rules and simple fast consequences help us be consistent. It starts with 1 min and increases by another minute if: they refuse, they don't stand still, they look around, they talk, they anything. If another child talks to them or ridicules them for getting time, they get the same as soon as the first person is done. It is quick. It only takes once or twice spending 10mins when it could have been 1min before they comply. And, sometimes I give myself time-outs too. I'm not perfect and it models that the rules apply to everyone. The hard part is determining what bad behavior will be punished. For us, it is anything they know they aren't supposed to do. This relates to the other posts about the escalating scale. As soon as they know, there are no more warnings. For example, when they are told not to touch something, and they do - corner. Hit someone in anger - corner.  Equally important is what happens afterwards. ""Why did you get a time-out?"" Kids are smart. If they can't answer, more time in the corner to think about it can help. This usually isn't necessary and we try to give prompts by asking leading questions about what was happening, how the situation evolved. Once the transgression is understood, the person has to come up with a way to make it better: try to mend the relationship by apologizing and fixing anything that was maliciously broken, making more cookies because they ate their brother's, that sort of thing. We really try to use logical consequences and avoid punishment. "
The noise of his children playing makes a parent tired and glad to leave for work,"Being a father of 2 kids in the same age range and having been switching from an on-site job to a home-office for the past 2 years, I can relate a little bit... I don't think there's anything wrong with your friend's state of exhaustion. It's a known issue for all parents.  At the time of this writing, I haven't had a refreshing holiday or even a week-end in more than 4 years now. There weren't many occurrences of these events to begin with, and they weren't relaxing or refreshing or replaining. I'm not saying I haven't had a fun times, but they all left me even more depleted than I was prior to these supposedly ""relaxing"" times. You either are full-time parenting, or fixing things that have needed to be fixed for, well, the times before the first pregnancy (you know, that distant memory of a life you had), or you do whatever thing you have to to do, but you don't really kick back and relax. Occasionally you manage to have both kids take a nap at the same time and you indulge in your own nap-time or maybe attempt to read 3 pages of a book before you doze off, but it's only to then feel guilt because you haven't done anything useful with that ""free"" time instead of using it to relax. It's normal, it comes with the ""job"", and obsessing over it just makes it worse. So your friend should just embrace it and accepts it's how things are now: it makes it a lot easier once you get there. It doesn't have to feel that way though. It's hard to snap out of it, but it's up to you really to make things work right. It's up to you to: Also, while I don't think I ever experienced the desire to go to work to get away from my kids, I'admit that I did occasionally feel that way when time came to leave the office: I'd think that staying later at the office was actually less tiresome than going home and having to deal with shopping, sorting out the mess, putting them to bed, etc... Because it honestly was less tiresome. But, it's also not a fair thing to do to my significant other who was either at home with the kid (""only"" one at the time) or coming home from uni. You can rationalize it in a number of ways (""I did that many shopping days, bed-time stories, and bla bla bla on top of my 80-hour week and this and that...""), but you're in the same boat so you just get over it and go home. Maybe you procrastinate or do actual work for an extra half-hour than you'd have done if the situation was different, but you don't ""hide away"". Ok, maybe you do it once in a while, but it's a bit like that nap you stole on a sunny Sunday afternoon: it doesn't feel quite right anyway - as your friend already experiences - and it's not something that should be a habit, as you wouldn't want your significant other to take that habit the other way around. Quite likely, you want your significant other to occasionally do this:  Now, working from a home office is a slightly different situation, but it relates even more to the cause of your friend's problem: the noise. It's fairly difficuly already to work from home and take care of the kids at the same time if you don't have a caretaker and the kids don't go to nursery (for various reasons depending on country, culture, or what-have-you). If at all possible as you can imagine that handling 2 kids while working makes working a full shift a bit of challenge. But even when you are not taking care of them they do produce a, ahem, fair share of noise and distraction. And it's exhausting, like any noisy environment. Kids are all different, and some are definitely noisier than others, but you can expect most of them to drain your energy rather quickly. Actually, it's not so much that they drain it, because if you don't actually do anything they'll still exhaust you. It's more that they drown your energy with theirs. You know, while they run around every where, scream, throw up, repeat a catch-phrase 100 times and do these other things they do. So, back to my point... Now when I have to go back on-site, while I don't look forward to it, I surely do enjoy the trade-off and try to see the positive thing in both. When on-site, I enjoy the relative peace and quiet I get, and that I can focus more easily on work and I try to make the best of this time to get things done, even though that implies that the exhaustion comes from work instead of family over that period. And when I'm at home with the little monsters^Wones I appreciate that I can see them grow up and that before I always thought I was missing out on these things. I had to go back to work right after my first kid was born and worked long hours, and I'm sure every parent hates leaving in the morning before their kids wake up and coming back home after they've gone to bed. Sure, it's quiet, but there's something not quite right there either. It's about seeing the glass half-full in both situations, and there's nothing wrong with that. As long as you're friend doesn't off-load his parental duties on someone else (too often) and loves his kids, then I don't think he's got to worry about anything. Being exhausted - physically, mentally and nervously - is perfectly normal, and longing for a time off is as well. Another suggestion could be to try to look back at his and his family's weekly routine and try to optimize it - without obsessing over it! - and see if they can grab 10 or 20 minutes here and there of ""private"" time, or if they can't get a friend or family to help. I know that for more than 2 years we were far from family and didn't have many friends around and it was basically one of these times where you can't offload much (and nurseries were private and too expensive where we were, and so were caretakers), so it was pretty much just us. And it's hard. But once you have friends and family who can give a hand, don't feel ashamed to ask occasionally, and be sure to respect that help in making the best of the time they give you (by making it either productive or relaxing). There are many ""mistakes"" we did as parents. They're more ""rites of passage"" than ""mistakes"", really, so just look at them this way. Off the top of my head, crazy stupid things we sometimes did included: The pattern in those is that they're all errors in prioritizing on the longer run. Anyways, until you can work on fixing things, take a deep breath and:  Comic strips courtesy of Baby Blues. ""Keep Calm and Carry On"" courtesy of the British Government, probably."
Why does my baby grind her face into my shoulder?,"Banging heads, grinding faces and side-diving (what I think you mean by ""swinging"") are all common forms of ""rooting"" behavior - that is, she is instinctively trying to find a breast to nurse from. This is typical for symptoms of hunger, but also general discomfort (nursing feels nice, and babies know it).  I'd try feeding her when she exhibits any of these behaviors.   If that doesn't help, she's probably just uncomfortable and doesn't know any way to self-soothe aside from eating.  That's her only instinctive mechanism for finding comfort.  Try to find other ways to comfort her if feeding doesn't help.  Try putting your finger in her mouth, or a pacifier.  If that doesn't work try bouncing her to sleep, and other comfort techniques."
Is it normal that my 2.5-year-old son still likes breastfeeding?,"You can understand why babies and toddlers may do that - your body is the source of their comfort and happiness. It is normal for them to do it, although a more common comfort is sucking the thumb, for example. As far as what age you may expect them to do it, this is entirely dependent on culture. Some cultures accept breastfeeding to quite an advanced age, others wean as early as possible - and habits like this track with weaning.  If it makes you uncomfortable, you could think about dissuading the activity, especially if your culture will not accept it in public. At the end of the day, they will stop at some point, so you can guide this point. And provide other comfort as needed, which could be cuddles where you encourage him to keep his hands to himself, or hold a toy etc."
Sex play in young children,"I'm answering as someone who was involved in sex play as a child. I feel that my experience is particularly useful in this discussion because it was fully benign (or so it seemed) and consensual.  Struggling with the memory was complicated beyond what I can easily explain here.  To begin with, I had lots of sexual thoughts through the ages of 4 to 12 and felt intense shame for it.  My experience occurred when I was so young that I was actually able to deny that it ever happened, and told myself that I made it up... because I was a bad person, it just made sense to me that way.  About a decade later on, the father of the other children involved went to prison for child molestation (I should stress this involved even more children).  I confronted the others involved in my incident (now adults), and found out that indeed, it did happen and that I wasn't crazy, and that I was somewhat of a 2nd echo of the terror that an adult was causing to children. We all obviously take this issue very seriously, but due to my own personal experience, I'm tempted to see it as much more than just ""it's not sexual to them"".  There are several things that you need to consider. There was a book that came out fairly recently which is absolutely fantastic for people who've struggled with such memories in their life.  If you want the really long answer to this question, I would suggest you read it.  The Trauma Myth: The Truth About the Sexual Abuse of Children - and Its Aftermath To summarize, society's efforts to provide resources to victims of child rape and molestation have narrowed our picture of what we see as a victim.  We've also narrowed the time frame on which we respond to it.  We've equipped ourselves to deal with the proverbial pedophile stranger who goes after kids in the playground, even though most cases don't fit a profile even remotely close to that.  The thrust of the book is that for most cases, the hard work of coping with childhood sexual trauma events often comes years afterwards as the individual learns how to correctly frame what happened, at which point they can feel all sorts of betrayal, shame, and other feelings. This might sound unhelpful, but when my parents dumped a pile of sex-ed books from the public library in my lap it really didn't help me come to closure with what I was dealing with.  It just intensified my feelings and didn't help me feel any less alone about it, but I think that sex-ed, in general, helps.  Children at all ages need some form of sex-ed, and when you encounter such an event you're somewhat forced into it.  The important things to communicate are: You have the opportunity to come from a space of understanding and empathy, not just about what your child is currently going through, but also about what they will confront in the future, which they don't know themselves.  It might be a fairly trivial event and it might not be, but either way the child just needs someone to be there to show love understanding and acceptance. The final thing to mention is that your relationship with the adults who spend time with your child's cousin might get complicated.  It's important to mention it could be anyone who spends time that child who implanted these behaviors, or it could be none of them.  Honestly, I would probably seek expert advice on this issue if I were you.  I'm not an expert."
Why do toddlers eat grass and not broccoli?,"Part of this is that he is exploring his environment, and tasting things is part of that. He's playing, and feels free to explore and play; so tasting is part of that.  At the dinner table, he is restrained in a high chair probably, he is provided a few things, and he presumably doesn't have very much freedom to play - so he plays with what he can (the food), and he expresses his preference to not be constrained or limited in his choices (by rejecting things). Part of this also could depend on how you present the food options.  A hungry kid will eat most anything in front of him.  What's first on his plate? Chicken nuggets in the shape of dinosaurs? Or the veggie option?  We found that, when veggies were provided 10-15 minutes before the main course, our kids nearly always ate them, even when not expressly encouraged to - we just put them out on the table or on their plate, walked away, went to prepare the main course.  Magically, they'd disappear! The ideal way to handle this, in my book, is simply to present the child with food you want to offer them, let them eat it or not, and don't add pressure to the situation.  They'll choose to eat when they're hungry, and if they're not hungry it's okay if they don't - try it again in a few hours, perhaps.  Obviously this doesn't apply to kids who are malnourished or have medical issues constraining their food intake - but for most kids, this works pretty well."
Is there any scientific evidence in favor of co-sleeping with children?,"The short answer to ""is there any scientific evidence in favor of co-sleeping?"" appears to be ""yes"". TLDR version: There are studies, particularly by Professor James McKenna, that show that there are strong correlations between co-sleeping and improved breast feeding.  These same studies suggest that co-sleeping mothers get at least as much sleep as mothers who sleep apart. However, there is considerable controversy over the impact of co-sleeping on SIDS. There is evidence supporting both the idea that co-sleeping reduces factors associated with SIDS, and that proper co-sleeping practices (there is no doubt that improper co-sleeping practices are associated with strong risks) have possible correlations with an increase in SIDS.  Neither side has any conclusive evidence, though.  /end TLDR There is a lot of speculative theories, and little in the way of concrete scientific research that I could find. The most notable research seems to be that of Professor of Anthropology James McKenna.  He has conducted research on mother-infant pairs in a laboratory environment, monitoring their sleeping habits as they slept both apart and together over three consecutive nights. I am not certain if the ""three nights"" were were three each of apart and together, or 2 of one and one of the other.  I also cannot find information about the normal sleeping habits of those mother-infant couples, as it would seem that disruptions in their standard sleeping arrangements would bias the results (i.e. mothers who normally co-slept at home would likely show less favorable results when sleeping apart in a laboratory environment, and vice versa). The concrete portions of the research seem to be summarized here: We found that bed-sharing infants face their mothers for most of the
  night, and that mother and infant are highly responsive to each
  other's movements, wake more frequently, and spend more time in
  lighter stages of sleep than they do while sleeping alone. Bed-sharing
  infants nurse almost twice as often, and three times as long per bout,
  as they do when sleeping alone. But they rarely cry. Mothers who
  routinely sleep with their infants get at least as much sleep as
  mothers who sleep without them. However, Professor McKenna has extended this research with some speculative theories: In addition to providing more nighttime nourishment and greater
  protection, sleeping with the mother supplies the infant with a steady
  stream of sensations of the mother's presence, including touch, smell,
  movement, and warmth. These stimuli can perhaps even compensate for
  the human infant's extreme neurological immaturity at birth. Co-sleeping might also turn out to give some babies protection from
  sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), a heartbreaking and enigmatic
  killer. Co-sleeping infants nurse more often, sleep more lightly, and
  have practice responding to maternal arousals. Arousal deficiencies
  are suspected in some SIDS deaths, and long periods in deep sleep may
  exacerbate this problem. Perhaps the physiological changes induced by
  co-sleeping, especially when combined with nighttime breastfeeding,
  can benefit some infants by helping them sleep more lightly. At the
  same time, co-sleeping makes it easier for a mother to detect and
  respond to an infant in crisis. He goes on to emphasize the speculative nature of the comments on SIDS: The effect of co-sleeping on SIDS remains to be proved, so it would be
  premature to recommend it as the best arrangement for all families.
  The possible hazards of co-sleeping must also be assessed. Is the
  environment otherwise safe, with appropriate bedding materials? Do the
  parents smoke? Do they use drugs or alcohol? (These appear to be the
  main factors in those rare cases in which a mother inadvertently
  smothers her child.) However, there are also studies that show a correlation between co-sleeping and an increase in the rate of SIDS. The American Academy of Pediatrics doesn't recommend completely against co-sleeping, but rather suggests restrictions and conditions: Bed sharing or cosleeping may be hazardous under certain conditions.54113–115  As an alternative to bed sharing, parents might consider placing the infant's crib near their bed to allow for more convenient breastfeeding and parent contact.  If a mother chooses to have her infant sleep in her bed to breastfeed, care should be taken to observe the aforementioned recommendations (nonprone sleep position, avoidance of soft surfaces or loose covers, and avoidance of entrapment by moving the bed away from the wall and other furniture and avoiding beds that present entrapment possibilities).  The AAP also cites some studies that have shown a correlation between co-sleeping and SIDS.  In some cases this correlation appears to be influenced by known factors (maternal smoking, co-sleeping on a sofa instead of a bed, drug or alcohol use by the parents, etc.), but in others seems only linked to the infant's age: epidemiologic studies of bed sharing have shown that it can be
  hazardous under certain conditions. Several case series of accidental
  suffocation or death from undetermined cause suggest that bed sharing
  is hazardous. 34,37–39 A number of case-control studies of SIDS deaths
  have investigated the relationship of SIDS with parent(s) and/or other
  adults or children sleeping with an infant.
  Some of these studies have found the correlation between death and bed
  sharing to reach statistical significance only among mothers who
  smoked. 41,47 However, the European Concerted Action on SIDS study, 42
  which was a large multisite study, found that bed sharing with mothers
  who did not smoke was a significant risk factor among infants up to 8
  weeks of age. Similarly, a more recent study conducted in Scotland48
  found that the risk of bed sharing was greatest for infants younger
  than 11 weeks, and this association remained among infants with
  nonsmoking mothers. The risk of SIDS seems to be particularly high
  when there are multiple bed sharers 31 and also may be increased when
  the bed sharer has consumed alcohol or is overtired. 42,47 Also, the
  risk of SIDS is higher when bed sharing occurs with young infants.
  40–42 It is extremely hazardous when adults sleep with an infant on a
  couch. 31,40,41,48 Finally, the risk of bed sharing is higher the
  longer the duration of bed sharing during the night.  The same paper from the AAP does mention studies that indicate benefits to co-sleeping: electrophysiologic and behavioral studies offer a strong case for its
  effect in facilitating breastfeeding and the enhancement of
  maternal-infant bonding. The studies referenced in that quote are two of McKenna's:  McKenna and his associates have issued a rebuttal to the AAP recommendations, specifically regarding co-sleeping. Most studies have shown no increased risk from infants bedsharing with
  non-smoking mothers, though the large multicentre European study
  showed a small risk, and a Scottish study showed a larger risk,
  particularly for younger infants, though no account was taken of
  parental alcohol intake. ...  Clearly there are inappropriate
  circumstances or environments in which co-sleeping occurs, with
  increased vulnerability of some infants, and these deserve further
  investigation. Over the last three years we have been investigating
  all unexpected infant deaths in the southwest of England (population 5
  million), approximately half of whom were co-sleeping with a parent. 
  The vast majority (>90%) of these co-sleeping deaths occured in an
  unsafe co-sleeping environment as defined by current UK guidelines ...
  After thorough death scene and postmortem investigations we have no
  evidence that the few SIDS deaths that occurred in a relatively safe
  co-sleeping environment are more than would have happened if the
  infants had slept alone in cots. ... Changing current guidelines to
  advise against co-sleeping for this particular group of mothers
  [non-smoking] would seemingly have little if any effect on the SIDS
  rates but could deny these mothers and infants any potential
  advantages in co-sleeping, including accessibility to the breast. He goes on to emphasize some of the potential benefits of co-sleep, and explains the difficulty in providing epidemiological evidence: [Bedsharing] is accepted as normal human practice by anthropolgists
  and infant physiologists. Indeed, much research has been conducted
  into mother-infant interactions, skin-to-skin care (Kangaroo care),
  arousal patterns, and the architecture of infant sleep.  These studies
  are often conducted on small selected populations and because of the
  complex issues involved are more qualitative than quantitative, but
  are necessary to derive a balanced argument on the potential benefits
  of bedsharing.  While many studies have shown a positive correlation
  between bedsharing and breast feeding, the lack of conclusive evidence
  that bedsharing has a causal role in the establishment and
  continuation of breast feeding may be a reflection of the lack of
  appropriate studies rather than the lack of such an effect."
How can I explain to my son why sunlight will hurt his eyes?,"I like the answer which discusses a sunburn. To get a more visceral reaction, you could show him how a magnifying glass can burn things by ""bunching up"" (focusing) the sunlight.  That should show him that the sunlight really is a destructive force."
Raising a bilingual kid. When should we introduce the majority language?,"You probably need to get started on English exposure soon. At some point he wants to play with other kids and unless you live in a French speaking enclave, that will happen in English. I suggest moving either daycare, or cartoons, or some TV/audio-books to English. I wouldn't worry too much about overloading your child: young kids have a remarkable ability to learn and absorb languages. Provided he integrates normally into the local society,  English will become the dominant language over time. I don't think the OTOL approach is particularly useful: we always spoke strictly non-English at home with the kids: It's best to maximize native speaker immersion in the non-local language and leverage any opportunity you can find.  Bi-lingual schools are a double edged sword. You really need to assess the school, their capabilities and their approach to bi-lingual education. We have seen example where it worked well (a good one was: alternate instruction language every month) and others were counterproductive (taught by non-native speakers).  We found that the trickiest part to get right are the formal parts of reading and writing: spelling, genders, grammar, etc. So any formal schooling in these area would be helpful provided they can be done well and approbriatley. "
How to encourage my 7 year old to move on from her preschool friend?,"I think attrition will allow this to happen in the most natural and least hurtful way. You could encourage new friendships by helping Beth to invite other friends over for playdates or taking her and a friend or two to outings like the park or swimming.  Lessons like swimming or art or dance (depends on her interests of course) or joining Girl Scouts might help her to find like-minded friends. There is no reason for her to forget her friend. I think these sorts of lessons are better taught naturally rather than with a specific lesson. Alice has moved on and that happens with many friendships over a lifetime. Beth will move on herself in time.   It sounds to me like you are raising a thoughtful and kind little girl, and I think that your encouragement (if she suggests inviting Alice) is perfectly fine. "
Is Television appropriate for meal times?,"My opinion and experience is that television provides much more disruption than benefit: My experience is that if the television is on, then everybody is ""glued to the screen"" or at least thoroughly distracted. This prevents social interaction, and it also prevents you from really appreciating the food you're eating -- potentially leading to eating disorders/obesity (because when you don't pay attention to what you're eating, you're actually eating more), but more likely leading to the cook rightly feeling unappreciated.  Mealtimes are not just for filling up on food, it is at least as much an important social event. Just because this event happens a few times each day doesn't make it less important. This is an opportunity for the family to get together, regardless of what other activities and obligations fill the day.  Mealtime is a good time to discuss matters relevant to the entire family. You might have some big ongoing concern or exciting family project. Or you can do an informal round-table interview to learn what everybody is up to. It's also a opportunity to teach younger children proper table manners; something that, if missed, can create embarrassing or disastrous situations in public or at guest events. For these reasons, the general rule should be ""no television during meals."" But any good rule must allow exceptions. If there is a very special movie on, or if there are important news, or (insert your family's criteria here), then announce an exception to the rule and thoroughly enjoy the privilege of watching television while eating. To enforce this rule, make sure that the family knows the general rule as well as the exception criteria."
What should I teach my teenager about condoms?,"Well, I went the carrot/condom route with my daughter when she was 12, along with discussing the following: Condoms are only effective when used properly.  This means, no baby oil for lube, no vaseline or anything petroleum - as it will rot the rubber and cause it to break. Insist that a condom is used!  If he's not willing to see to your safety and health - it's obvious he doesn't care about you, only about getting laid.  Dump him and find someone else that's worth your time! The condom goes ON before ANYTHING goes IN. If it comes off for any reason, a NEW one must be used.  IF it breaks - and you find out AFTER you're done, don't be afraid OR ashamed to get an emergency contraceptive.  If you go to one pharmacy and they won't dispense it, go to another - but remember the first and never shop there again.  If there isn't anyone who will dispense Plan B to you, call me and I will come with you and get it - even if I have to drag a lawyer and a baseball bat with me. When you're in a committed relationship, think about getting on the pill (but know that it must be taken regularly at the same time of day, and you can't skip a pill), but only after you've both been tested for STD's.  There are worse things out there than pregnancy."
"How to address my son’s fear of mostly passive objects, namely smoke detectors","Smoke detectors are not ""harmless"", especially if you are three years old and had one going off suddenly. Can you explain to him how they work? Not the technical details, but the purpose: smoke -> alarm -> safety. And that they have to be very loud so that they wake everyone up in case of a fire? They are like the siren on a police car, fire truck or ambulance: loud, frightening and an important warning system.  This is one of the rare cases where I'd try to fight fire with fire: Let him set the alarm off with a incense stick or whatever triggers yours (practise before when he's not home!), so that he can see for himself how they work. Use earplugs, if necessary. And explain that in the last instance the alarm had a malfunction - it misunderstood something and went off, but it meant well - it ""thought"" there was a real danger, so it sounded the alarm. This method should work best if he's interested in all kinds of machinery (and lots of little boys are) and is probably the non-destructive variety of dismantling the thing. If it goes off next time, he must know that there might be a real fire and that you are prepared to deal with this accordingly. Perhaps an explanation on proper procedure in real emergencies would fit nicely here, too, like what to do, what not, where to go, etc. (And if the smoke detector goes off again, replace it, but that's probably pretty obvious.)"
When is it OK to take a newborn swimming?,"Most sources will state no sooner than 6 months, but it kind of depends on the baby's size.  Infants are notoriously poor at regulating body temperature when it comes to environment. They can't dissipate heat as well as older babies, and worse yet, they can't generate heat when cold. Most public pools will be too cold for an infant; there is a very real risk of hypothermia. Interestingly, your baby can already swim right now; it's a reflex (not unlike the Moro response) that will be lost as the baby ages. If you can find a pool heated for your purpose, I can't think of a good reason to wait, with two caveats: you will find the water too warm to be comfortable, and the baby risks ear infections. Probably the best option right now is a clean bathtub. Swimming Programs for Infants and Toddlers

How to persuade my father to stop physically abusing my mother?,"First off let me applaud you loudly for taking this step. Many in similar situations are too ashamed to admit it to others. Your mother is one example. Unfortunately, this is a large complex problem, which we can help only minimally online. Google ""abused women help"" - Which resources look useful to you? In the United States, many cities have shelters for abused women.  Contact the closest one. She needs to know that she has options- there is another way to live. I am not an expert, but apparently getting the police involved lessens the risk to her sometimes. Other resources are:"
"How do you handle unsupervised, poorly behaved children in public play areas?","I've found that children generally are deferential to adults who aren't their relatives or friends. So be friendly and don't be scared to engage with them.  I've found if children are hogging stuff, if you say: ""Hey there can my kid have a go on this, it looks cool?"" will usually result in them moving along to something else, or showing you and your kid how whatever you want to do works. With low-level pushing and shoving then it you make yourself know as a presence then kids can back off. Usually I ask my son if he is okay, he'll usually complain about the kid who has pushed him. At which point we go back to asking if we can play with whatever they are shoving over.  When it comes to fighting then I always say: ""Hey, cut that out!"". Kid's that use violence are generally old enough and savvy enough to know they are misbehaving. And that behaviour isn't acceptable.  It's not about disciplining children, it's about making them aware of what they are doing. They should know whether that is behavior is acceptable. "
How do you tell your child they are terrible at something?,"I would explain that different skills require certain amount of practice and if she wants to see more action on the field she will need to put in more time to increase her skill level. Don't say it like: 'If you try harder people will pass you the ball'. As this is negative and largely not true. Soccer is about trust and other team members expect that you have the ability (skill) to proceed once the ball has been passed. Explain how her hero Mia Hamm would have practiced daily to build her skill and trust within the team. Just like studying math, soccer requires certain skill and some people have a better base skill than others. You can make it fun by spending some time with her kicking the ball around in your back yard or local park doing some simple drills. If you don't know these then ask her coach for appropriate exercises. Once children reach about 12 years of age those kids with good base skills will start to drop off against those that have a better understanding of the game and have developed their skills over time. You can also read some articles online about soccer theory and discuss with your daughter. Make this about her development as a player and her future as a proficient soccer player, rather than about her trying to fit in."
"I don't like my mom and she is coming to stay with me, how to prevent it or handle in the best way?","It looks from your post that you have very good reasons not to let your mother stay at your place. 
It seems that in spite of seeing all the reasons why this is a bad idea you are still hesitant. A few points to consider: In terms of how to do it - I don't think you should need to move anywhere or make up anything. What about if you say that she can't stay at your place? And if pressed for a reason say you don't want her to stay with you. I know it sounds like a harsh thing to say for a nice person. But it is not harsh - it is just setting and guarding your boundaries. 
Also - you know these people who can tell others things they really don't want to hear and it does not sound even a bit harsh? I think the key is not to say it as if you were guilty and feeling somewhat bad about your decision. But rather state it as a (sad) fact. Which actually it is. A sad fact that your mother can't stay at your place. And avoid giving any explanation and going into details.
Another thing is - if your mother cares for you (in spite of making all these huge mistakes) - she will understand and appreciate the level of contact you are happy to keep. If she does not care - even more of a reason to not care so much either and take care of yourself.  You mentioned the option of switching off your phone. But that similarly as the idea of moving out from your flat temporarily sounds like instead of trying to put a boundary of your territory (and it is definitely yours: your home, phone, time) you let your mother to come closer than you can accept and move back yourself. 
It sounds like you feel strongly about no letting your mother come and stay - so this is the minimum. You also have the right to refuse to talk to her/talk to her more often that you want to/see her. I'm not saying it is a good idea. Just suggest than you think of what level of communication with your mother would be best for you and how it compares to reality."
How do you handle poor behavior by other people's children?,"As a general rule of thumb, if there is a parent / baby sitter / caregiver present I try and let them take care of matters, using the lower end of my interpretation of generally accepted behavior as the yard stick for when to interfere. If I do think I have to interfere I'll address the child, not the parent. This usually helps. If that rubs the parent the wrong way they'll let me know and I can let them know they really should have done something about it before I interfered. (Although, usually, if they don't care about their children's behavior, typically they don't seem to care about me correcting it). The above is assuming the behavior is not endangering any one. If that's the case I'll jump straight in and deal with any sensitive parents later. If the behavior does not get better, we'll up and leave. When it comes to play dates (i.e. no other parent present), the presiding parent should determine what's acceptable and what's not. I'm stricter than some of my son's friend's parents and easier than others. Kids will quickly learn to adjust to whatever parent is calling the shots (it's either that or no more play dates). For a while we had to stop play dates with one particular friend who'd get consistently out of control. He's grown out of it and now he listens and all is well. We never had to call the other parent to cut a play date short, but that's always an option. Also the threat of no more play dates EVER unless behavior gets better right this minute usually helps as well.  I've found that over time you end up hanging out with like minded parents / kids and so it becomes less and less of an issue. Also the older kids get (my son is 8 now) the more they seem to be able to gauge what is acceptable behavior and what isn't and to self correct (and stay away from kids that don't exhibit similar ideas as to what's acceptable)."
What's an appropriate age to involve kids in life changing decisions?,"I will address only one issue: At roughly what age levels is it appropriate for the kids to have what levels of say in their upbringing? At every age, a child should have a voice about their preferences and should be heard and dealt with respectfully (patience, kindness, consideration.) But from birth, a parent is responsible to do the best for their child. A primary responsibility of a parent is to truly love their child. Ask yourself - before asking others what they think - ""Is this course of action loving my child?"" Knowing your child and their level of maturity will guide you. They should have more say in minor matters (e.g. after-school activities) at an earlier age than deciding with whom to stay (I believe that right is given to them legally at the age of 16 in the US.) Others have given answers with concrete examples of loving your children. Please consider reframing the entire situation. Some possibly helpful references: Co-parenting After a Divorce?

"My son wants to bring a present to a birthday party where ""no presents"" was specified on the invitation","I think there are a couple of important points here: My son (3) likes to give presents.
  (...)
  We recently received an invitation to a cousin's 5th birthday. The invitation says ""No gifts please!"".   This child's parents have specified ""no gifts"" for other events, as well (previous birthdays, family holiday celebrations, etc.), but the boy still received some gifts (usually from the grandparents, and a few of the mother's family members). Since you didn't state the reason behind the rule, I assume you don't know what it is. Assuming that there's a normal family relationship between you and the cousin's parents, I would ask them. Depending on the reason, you can gauge how your son transgressing this rule would be received. If you feel it would not be a big deal, you can explain that your son would really like to bring a gift, and ask if and how this is possible. If it's really not permissible for your son to bring a gift, you now have a reason you can explain to your son. Perhaps they don't want an avalanche of gifts for their kid, perhaps they don't have much room left for more toys, perhaps they are a bit snobbish and think that no one but they can find gifts that are good enough for their son, perhaps they've invited kids from poor families who don't have much money for gifts and who they don't want to make feeling bad. Depending on the reason given, you could help your son pick a present that meets their constraints, agree to give it another time, or (as has been suggested) give something to charity. TL;DR: Communication is the key."
Where should boys aim their urine?,"Not to take the fun out of devising your own experiment, but the fine fluid dynamics physicists at the Splash Lab (at Brigham Young University) are trying to figure out how to prevent urinal splash-back right now! Fluid dynamics scientists (calling themselves the ""wizz kids"") set up a water tank and nozzles (emitting colored water) to mimic the natural flow of human urine as it leaves the body. They then filmed the action using high-speed cameras. Scrutiny of the video allowed the team to clearly see which sorts of techniques cause the most, or least splash-back. You can see the surprising results at Phys.Org and more at ExtremeTech.com Interestingly, they examined splash-back at different angles on water and porcelain. They found a splash-free zone exists right around the rim of the bowl, but it ""increases the odds of actually missing the bowl altogether"", Hurd noted. ""I wouldn't recommend this approach to anyone but military snipers,"" he added. The absolutely best way to reduce splash back? Sitting while urinating. An interesting aside: I taught my boys by drawing a target on a square of toilet tissue and floating the target mid-bowl. I found that there was very little splash back when they hit it. Adopting this technique in public restrooms eliminates almost all splash-back. Nice to see it finally in print!"
Why does my 16-year-old hate me?,"There's not a lot to go on here, so let me just throw out a few possibilities. Children sometimes get into a state where it gives them comfort to know that you will love them no matter what.  They test that love by being intentionally provocative.  In a backwards kind of way he may be showing he has confidence in your unconditional love.  Responding as if he had said ""I love you"" can be very effective in this case.  Just refuse to take it as an insult, and say, ""I love you too."" Another possibility is he just enjoys the reaction.  The response in that case is to deny him the reaction.  Try a deadpan ""Ha ha, very funny"" instead of flipping out. Another possibility is that in his mind, you care more about your own happiness than his, and you're just trying to mold him into a perfect son in order to make yourself look good.  Try to reassure him otherwise.  Don't exaggerate his accomplishments to others.  Praise his effort even when he fails. Another possibility is he is hurting you to deflect his own pain.  He might feel bad about his grades, his weight, or his lack of friends, but doesn't want to appear vulnerable.  Just acknowledging his pain without pressuring can help.  ""I know it can be lonely without friends."" The worst case possibility is his self-worth is actually tied into opposition to authority, perhaps as the result of his peers or other influences.  I don't really know what to do in that case other than waiting it out, and trying to show him he is hurting himself more than you. It could be a combination of these things, or something else altogether.  I wish you the best of luck."
Should I expect my 20 year old son to get a job while at University?,"TL;DR: You are not the bad guy; it's time for him to start building up strength to fly on his own.  This is one of the hardest, most distressing parts of parenting. We want to be wise, just and loving towards our children; we don't want to feel that we're being unloving. Many of us also feel some guilt as well, thinking Where have I failed in teaching my child a good work-ethic? If your husband is involved, you need to provide a united front here. You will need to support each other. A support system of friends, or a group-meeting type of thing might help, too.  It's normal in most societies to expect a 20 year old man to pull his own weight. Many expect a 20 yr old to be out of the house by now (except, perhaps, during summer breaks if attending university). You should have no guilt (i.e. you're not the bad guy) in expecting the same of your son. This situation didn't happen overnight and it won't go away overnight. The following is one of many possible scenarios (alter as you see fit).  Since your son hasn't had a job yet, he's not likely to get one tomorrow, so he'll need some time. Decide how much longer you can reasonably tolerate his behavior, and set this up as a starting point for your new expectations. Sit down and have a talk with him as soon as possible outlining your new expectations; know he's likely to test them and be ready to hear a lot of blame-shifting. It doesn't matter what anyone else is doing; these are your expectations. Tell him that in n months (say, 3-6), he needs to have a job working at least x number of hours (40 hours - [verifiable hours spent in class X 3]) a week - even if that means two part-time jobs - and he needs to pay you x pounds per month for rent, and pay for half of his food. Set a reasonable (bare bones) clothing allowance, and tell him this will be all the money he gets. In (6-12?) months, his room and board will be (full, decent and fair rent and utilities, all food), and his gas and part of the insurance (whatever) for the car, and no more clothing allowance.  Next, tell him he's old enough to appreciate all you do for him, and that while you will always love him and be his mother, your days of serving him are over starting now. He needs to do his own cleaning up after himself, his laundry, etc. If he doesn't do his dishes, put them aside, and tell him he can use them in whatever condition they're in for his next meal. Offer to teach him how to do laundry and how to cook. Preparing yourself ahead of time for his balking will help when he complains. Discuss what his options are if he doesn't clean up his act: he can rent a flat with some friends, he can try to see if any of his friends or relatives will take him in, he can panhandle for the money, he can work for you for (minimum?) wage, he can apply for welfare, backpack across Europe, whatever. But mean it. He needs to be pulling all his weight or he needs to be somewhere else. A necessary part of raising a child is letting him learn to fly on his own. You're giving him 6 - 12 months to get his act together. I think this is fair. Also, sit down with your 18 year old and tell him there is no law (neither man's nor God's) that states all children must be treated equally, and that you've learned from your mistakes with the eldest. Start setting some limits for him as well. This will be a hard time for you. Gather strength from the fact that this is a difficult but necessary part of your sons' growing up, and that you're doing this for them, not for your convenience. The only caveat I would make for this is in the case of documented mental illness. In that case, I would consult my son's therapist(s) and look into options as agreed upon by us and the therapist. Edited for update: You sound like a really lovely mom, the kind of mom a lot of us would have loved to have had, and it's clear that you love your son very much. This is so important for someone who feels overwhelmed and doesn't have a lot of friends or self confidence. Your continued love is very necessary for his well being.  At the same time, though, it sounds like you don't expect enough from your son and that you make excuses for behaviors which are ultimately bad for him. Just isolating a few lines from your update, you say: It would seem awful for the rest of us to sit around the table eating a nice meal and to tell him that he has to buy/make his own food separately... I wash his clothes as this takes no extra time or effort on my part... I cant expect him to take the dog out every day... He is an intelligent boy academically...[t]he problem is He is introverted... When I was young I was also shy... I stopped giving him money or buying him clothes, but he just wore the same old clothes all year...when he started uni he spent his student loan on a computer, a holiday and the rest covered his travelling fares so there wasn't any left to charge him rent....he's applied for jobs but half heatedly as he is only doing it to appease [us] and in the current climate I don't think this is going to land him a job any time soon...[H]ow relieved I would feel if he just got a job, anything...just...that first step....maybe taking away his..comfort zone...I don't want to do anything that causes him to drop uni, which I'm sure he will if he's pushed too hard... I like him living with us in any case, despite him being messy and unsociable I just want him to take some responsibility and get a job for his own sake and to ease my worried mind. If you expect so little from him, why should he believe in himself? Yes, he had to wear the same old clothes. That's called a natural consequence. If that (and the rest) pains you too much, you aren't doing him any favors. You learned early that to work was to survive. It was hard for you and you gave up a lot. You want your son to have a better life that you had/have. All parents who love their kids want that. But I am pretty confident in saying that if you don't (lovingly, but truly and confidently) expect anything more from him, he will not gain confidence in himself. He will not be able to support a wife or family. This is your son and his life, and you get to choose what to do, but you are not helping him to become a successful adult, and that's a big part of your job. When will you give him a chance (also known as lighting a fire under his tush) to learn to live without you, to eat, cook, clean, take responsibility, with a uni degree and a job? You have a lot of thinking to do here. Please, for your son's sake, change your expectations of him. He won't and probably can't do it for himself. And if he drops out of uni, he can always go back. If you think he's depressed or anxious, have him see a therapist, but move forward. Life isn't black or white, yes or no; it's a thousand paths of grey. Stop expecting him to fail if you push him. He might end up soaring one day."
Is there an alternative to Boy/Girl Scouts in the US?,"I'd like to offer an alternative, which is the B-PSA (Baden-Powell Service Association) (http://bpsa-us.org).  I'm commissioner for the association, and we are open to everyone, without exception, youth and adult, boys and girls. Our policy of inclusion provides an environment for both secular (myself included) and non-secular participation.  We are a traditional scouting program, based on the same scouting methods and aims laid down by Baden-Powell when he founded scouting in 1907.  Our intention is to keep to the traditional, outdoor based program and make scouting available to every youth and adult that would like to participate. We have program sections for ages 5-7 (Otters), 8-10 (Timberwolves), 11-17 (Pathfinders) and 18+ (Rovers). I'm also the Group Scoutmaster for a local B-PSA group in Missouri; and I would be happy to answer any questions about the program and how we operate. We're very small right now; but have various groups starting up in different areas of the US. I'd be glad to help you setup a new group and get one going in your area as well.  You can get in touch with me via the ""Contact"" form on the main web site, http://bpsa-us.org or my contact information here.  I hope this gives you some more information on your questions; and maybe the program lines up with what you are looking for in a scouting organization."
"How do I address a teacher humiliating my son by calling him a ""tattletale""?","I will answer this from the point of view of, once upon a time, the child in this situation.  I don't know if any of this applies to your friend's child as I don't know him, but perhaps it will for others in a similar situation if nothing else. I was the 'perfect' student as a child; always the teacher's pet, always the top of the class, always wanting everyone else to follow the rules.  As such, I was very frequently the child in the OP: telling the kids in the class to shush. I never was called a tattle tale by a teacher (certainly frequently by the students), but to some extent I wish I had been - not in that way, mind you, it sounds like (unless the child is leaving out details) the teacher didn't handle it in a very mature way - but at some point in my late elementary school or early middle school career, it would've been nice for someone to explain to me exactly what I was doing: putting myself above my classmates, and as such ensuring I would not have any friends until high school, at which point an older student who I had made friends with explained all of this to me. The issue for me was primarily that I believed I was smarter/better/etc. than everyone else, largely because I was told that I was by my parents and my teachers - not necessarily in a bad way, I'd note; I was probably analytically smarter than the other kids, and they wanted to encourage me to keep learning, and I in many ways did act more mature than the other kids - and not really taught humility sufficiently (as hard as that is to do).  When I was hushing them, I was reminding them that I was smarter/more mature than they were, and putting them in their place.  That led to social issues, and led to me continuing to believe I was better than the other kids up until I ran into the brick wall of puberty - and even after, in many ways, until the lessons from my friend in high school. So what I'd do in this case, is ascertain to what extent the child was taking the appropriate action for the situation.  If he was shushing the other kids, it's almost certainly not the right action - whether it is ""playing adult"", or contributing to noise, or whatever, I've very rarely seen a situation where one kid telling other kids to be quiet was productive.  If he couldn't hear the announcement, he should either raise his hand and tell his teacher that he can't hear politely - not addressing the cause of the noise, simply addressing the specific problem at hand - or after it was over, ask the teacher politely what the announcement was about, as he couldn't hear.  If that is exactly what the student did, and it wasn't very well received, then perhaps let the student know that the teacher may have been having a difficult time (stress etc.) and to not let one bad experience throw him off; and then spend a little time reinforcing the correct ways to deal with the problem to give him some good tools in his toolbox. There is of course a separate problem here, that the teacher may not be doing enough to control the class; that's impossible for any of us to really answer without being there.  I've worked in schools where the teachers cared very little, and noise there was a constant; I've worked in schools where they cared very much, and controlled it effectively; and plenty of places in between.  If this is a long term issue, your friend may want to go to the principal with her/his concerns, or even consider changing schools if the school is run poorly in general."
How quickly do I need to change my newborn with a dirty diaper?,"Yes you can wait.  Unless you can't be interrupted (like when you're driving), you should change the diaper ""reasonably fast,"" meaning within ten minutes or so during the daytime. That's a very rough guideline though. Here are some considerations: It varies how well children handle nighttime diaper changes. With newborns, my experience is that it's all in one go, so you would not need to wait at all. By the time you've got him undressed, enough time will have passed already. But beware of rogue peeing :-) this often happens within seconds of removing the dirty diaper. Have a washcloth ready to cover the privates. Infants and toddlers often take a few minutes to finish. With infants, just wait a few minutes and then change. With toddlers, you might be able to use this time for potty training, but that's another story. Generally, waiting a little while does no harm. An exception is if the diaper area is already irritated or infected, in which case the diaper should be changed as soon as reasonably possible as to prevent extending the condition. Finally, waiting usually means smelling so there will likely be a natural limit to how long you will be willing to wait :-) And of course there will be situations where you simply don't notice for a looong time. Don't worry yourself over that, it just happens."
How do you handle bilingual education in a country where you do not speak the language natively?,"There are many studies on bilingual children and the most important thing highlighted in those I've read are that exposure to the language in the first six months helps the childs' brain develop the necessary functions to distinguish all the sounds of the different languages. For example, an average English-speaking adult who starts learning Chinese cannot possibly hear all of the different tones used in Chinese as their brain didn't develop the capacity to do so at an early age. There's an interesting TED talk on it: http://www.ted.com/talks/patricia_kuhl_the_linguistic_genius_of_babies.html Our children are exposed to English, Chinese and French and can move between them without thinking about it, but are rarely happy to speak something in a particular language on demand - they don't see it as a party piece, it's just what they do."
"Should I tell my 10-year old son, how screwed-up Cinderella is?","What you should not do is to simply talk badly about a favourite story of his. What you could do instead is put the story into perspective - and don't do this with this fairy tale alone, but with as many as possible. If you do this as an ""early start to literary studies"" you might actually do him a favour.  Topics to cover could be: Of course, you can't do this simply in one big lesson, but asking questions that lead a child to think about these topics can be done ""in passing"". So back to your original questions: One last point about your personal conclusion that Cinderella will resent her father and thus resent her chivalrous Prince Charming: Perhaps she will be simply grateful for the chance to have a better and safer life that she won't make him miserable? Perhaps she is simply one of these ever-suffering ever compliant females that will submit to his wishes like she did to her step-mother's before? We can't say because the fairy tale doesn't tell us. Why not stick with the reassuring ""And they lived happily ever after."" that tells us that all conflict has been resolved at the end? (In fact, an important message of fairy tales...) So no. Do not push your fears of your son picking the wrong woman in perhaps ten years into one simple fairy tale today. Criticizing the behaviour that is explicitly in the story is fine, too many what ifs is IMHO the wrong way to go. I'm sure that the pattern of women that your son will be drawn towards is formed by many, many females he meets or reads about, not just by one fictional character. (1) IMHO, taking about relationships that are as unbalanced or broken as in your example can wait at least another five years or more. I'm sure there will be some kind of literary or movie (hopefully not real-life) example that may trigger this discussion..."
"Reasoning vs ""because I say so""","Explaining the reason tasks are required will help the child gain an understanding of tasks. It is developmentally important that children understand tasks - what we are doing and why so as they get older, they can reason through tasks themselves. However, bargaining, while tempting, sets a precedence of ever heightening ""price"" for compliance. This teaches a child that they can extort a price for every task you ask of them.  From a variety of things I have read, it is important to find a balance between the two styles mentioned above. The ultra authoritarian perspective of Do it because I say so, period, is likely to lead to resentment in addition to stunting the child's ability to problem solve and reason thought tasks. The bargaining will be hard to break the child of as they age. Behavior is learned and the child is learning that if they hold out, there will be some extrinsic value to completing every day tasks.  An amazing resource that looks at balanced parenting in No, Why Kids of All Ages Need to Hear it and Ways Parents can say It by David Walsh. It touches on bargaining for tasks. It does not really address the overly authoritarian parenting style, but may be able to provide some ideas for finding a parenting style that is consistent between both parents.  It is NEVER good for parents to be in a position of extreme opposite parenting styles. It is confusing to the child and leads to possible resentment towards one parent. Balanced is the best, but togetherness is essential. Parents need to be a unified team. "
When your child says something embarrassing in public... how do you deal with it?,"Luckily young children get something of a ""pass"" when it comes to social awkwardness since the world by-and-large understands what it's like to be a child. I wouldn't go out of my way to downplay the situation. As a parent, your primary responsibility is in teaching the kid, not distracting him or otherwise quashing the social embarrassment. Most people understand that principle as well, so you get something of a ""pass"" as well. You don't have to be silent or unembarassing, you just have to be instructive. So instead, address the issue with the child very directly and quickly in a way that the child will find satisfactory and which will help prevent this sort of thing in the future. Remember, the thoughts going through the childs mind play out something like this:  There's someone over there that looks very unusual; I don't know what to make of it. I'll point it out to Dad because he usually has the answers. However you respond will instruct him on how to behave in the future when that sort of thing happens again. If you ignore the situation, the kid will get confused and/or frustrated, and will likely escalate the situation -- he pointed it out for a reason. So I would stop, make sure I have the child's attention and say, ""No, sweetie, she's not a witch, she's a normal person like you and me. In fact, I don't think she would like it if you called her a witch -- would YOU like it if someone said YOU were a witch?"" This (a) addresses the kid's concern (there's a witch over there) and enlarges the concept of ""normal people"" to include those that look like she does, (b) establishes that we won't say she's a witch anymore, and (c) gives the kid a good rule that he can apply in the future when someone looks unusual (""would YOU like it if someone called you a ...?"").

I don't want to be a father [closed],"When we are confronted with a situation in our lives where what we believe doesn't match up to how we're living, we have two choices: Change our beliefs or change our actions.  I think I know that tightness in your chest, and when I've experienced it, it's when what I am is not what I want to be. Other posters have suggested the latter. Get out for sure, only a matter of when. I disagree with that. I encourage you to reevaluate your situation and examine your beliefs. Even if being ""important and powerful and chang[ing] the world"" are noble aims, plenty of important, powerful, and impactful men have had a wife and children. In fact, depending on how you and your wife operate as a couple, she can help you achieve your goals. Sometimes I feel like I don't work on that side project because I have my wife in the house, but when I get a weekend alone I end up screwing around and not doing anything. But when she got serious about finances and helped me to do the same, it helped to encourage me to go and find new work that led me to a career advancement. She makes me better, when we work together. I see the same thing in my parents: My dad consults while my mom handles the home's finances. They make each other better, and while I don't know for sure, I'm guessing they'd both say that having children made them better as well. Here's the thing about marriage: it can be hard, and it takes work. Very few people will be united without conflict. But if both of you are willing to make it work, you can make it work. Wise counsel can help here. My wife and I went through a book called ""Lifelong Love Affair"" with some friends, and that was really good. Based on your story, it would seem like you haven't communicated your non-polyamorous hopes and dreams very well. If she seems suffocating, she should know that, but in her defense your interest in other women would definitely create trust issues. These are the sorts of things that need to be worked out. All of this is to say that the best thing for your son is for you to learn how to be content in your circumstances. If you can learn how to not just live with but truly love your wife, if you can change the things that you're putting your hope in, then you can give your son the greatest gift you can: A loving, content, and attentive father. If you walk out, it doesn't guarantee that you will become important, powerful, or even happy. If you stay and fight for what you have already attained, it's a pretty safe bet that a little boy will think of you as the most important and powerful person in his life."
How do I help my 3 year old daughter who is terrified of what I believe is a ghost?,"I heard that when you insist that there is no scary things out there, she feels alone. Because she is sure of what she sees, and she needs your help, and when you keep saying that there is no scary things, monster or ghosts, she feels abandoned.
I think when she is terrified, it is better not to mirror these feelings. When she talks about a scary things, and see her mother is worried, she will probably think that her mother is  worried because of the scary thing. So, staying calm and being mindful about our own face mimics is important.
So, I suggest that go and look at this scary things with her. You are strong, and you can protect her from the ghost. Give this feeling.  I do not suggest to use logic and long  explaining, it just makes her more  confused."
How do parents have sex when there's a toddler in the house?,Wait until the toddler is asleep.
How do my wife and I stop our son from learning to swear from us?,"It's true:  to stop swearing in front of your kids, you really have to stop swearing altogether.  Like a lot of young couples, my wife and I swore casually in conversation, which kept the words in ready recall when you need an interjection for stubbing your toe.  Even if you watch your mouth around the kids, when you get cut off in traffic or knock over a glass of milk, the words will come out before you think about them.   So here's the two step approach: What works best is to come up with some harmless synonyms, and if they're amusing you'll be more likely to stick with them.  As an easy example, we'd say ""donkey"" anytime we would have said ""ass"", which ended up cracking us up.  Eventually the day came when our daughter pointed out to us something she considered to be ""bad-donkey"", and we decided even the euphemism should be cleaned up a bit before she takes it to preschool.  It was surprisingly easy replacing the real swears with similar G-rate words, and it was perfectly easy to turn off the humorous synonyms later."
"When a baby cries, should we speak to it?","If you want to do what is best for your baby, then you should be talking to her pretty much all the time, except when she's asleep. So yes, talk to her when she cries; your voices will let her know she's being heard. Please know that she heard you talking when she was in your uterus. Although the sound is a bit different now, the cadence, rhythm, etc., are the same. So, it would certainly be soothing to her to speak to her softly when she is crying. Yours is the most soothing voice she knows.The baby may not stop crying immediately, but it won't hurt her (she will still fall asleep, etc.). It might also help to know when crying peaks in babies, because it is probably getting worse these days. Babies' crying peaks at about six weeks then gradually gets better.  You might look at this question and its answers as well as this one to get more information on why speaking to infants matters. Editted to add: Apologies to the OP for presuming you are the mother. If you are the father, by all means please talk to your baby. The answer is only slightly different if you are the dad. :) Effects of experience on fetal voice recognition."
Why is technology bad for children?,"First, setting some baselines.  The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends limited, but not zero, screen time for most children above 2. Under 2, and in particular under 18 months, no screen time other than video chat (Facetime/Skype/etc.). For children younger than 18 months, avoid use of screen media other than video-chatting. Parents of children 18 to 24 months of age who want to introduce digital media should choose high-quality programming, and watch it with their children to help them understand what they're seeing. For children over two, up to about 5, an hour a day is reasonable, so long as it is high 
quality programming. (What you describe would qualify as high-quality, I believe). For children ages 2 to 5 years, limit screen use to 1 hour per day of high-quality programs. Parents should co-view media with children to help them understand what they are seeing and apply it to the world around them. For children over six, there is no longer a blanket recommendation; the recommendation is to simply ensure screen time is not taking the place of other needs. For children ages 6 and older, place consistent limits on the time spent using media, and the types of media, and make sure media does not take the place of adequate sleep, physical activity and other behaviors essential to health.  Many reasons exist to suggest limiting screen time.  Adverse associations with sleep, attention spans, obesity, and language development in particular are called out. Going into these in a bit more detail: Obesity.  Some of the connection with obesity is likely due to the connection between obesity and sleep.  Eating during screen time is another. Advertising (and the connected social pressure) is also a related issue, though less so for non-television (or non-ad-based-tv) screen time of course.  The linked study of studies above goes into more detail on this connection; it also emphasizes that screen time can sometimes be beneficial. Sleep.  The link between screen time and reduced sleep seems strong, but it's been very difficult to find a causal link.  Theorized links include simply spending more time on screen that could have been spent on sleep; light from screens causing reductions in natural sleepiness; and decreases in physical activity relating to children not spending time outside as much.  Of course, these are all pretty hard to test.   Attention spans.  Very young children (<2 or <3) seem to have some correlation between reduced attention spans later in life and some kinds of programming.  It's become more clear though that specifically educational programming likely does not have this connection.  The linked study finds that below 3, non-educational programming is linked to reduced attention spans 5 years later, while at 4 or 5 years it is no longer linked to reduced attention spans later in life.  It's not clear why this is present only at 3 or earlier. Language development.  Again, really only an issue very early on.  Theorized reasons are largely based on the fact that younger children develop language from listening to adults speak (to and to each other), and screen time often replaces these interactions. Much of this language development happens in the first two years of life. Beyond the research, which mostly focuses on younger children, the key is consistency and ensuring it does not interfere with other activities - in particular, entirely replacing active play.  In these older children, obesity and sleep are still concerns, at least potential concerns.  Ensuring children are not using screens to the exclusion of sleep, homework, chores, or active play is critical, and of course ensuring children develop their own internal controls beyond parental controls."
"Should children be preemptively taught about drugs, alcohol, and sex?","These things you list are a part of our lives, either because we use/do them or other people we know or see use/do. Discovering things through friends is rarely a good idea. That's how myths are spread, ""you can't get pregnant the first time"", ""masturbation will make you impotent"", ... ""drugs are good"". You should give your children the important information yourself. Drugs, alcohol and other substances which alter our behavior(energy drinks, pepsi, coffee, antihistamines, painkillers, etc. etc.) should in my opinion be discussed with kids. I think that a child around 10 is perfectly capable of understanding how alcohol or drugs work and what they can cause. Perhaps even earlier. But don't go into much details about drugs until some time later, I think. Children should definitely know about sex. Girls should know ""the general idea"" (penetration, sperm, egg, fertilization) before they begin menstruating, I think. Perhaps have the ""sex talk"" along with the ""period"" talk. And since it's not obvious when will that happen, 9-10 yo is a good age. For boys - it can be a year or two later. Watch the pajamas for the new kind of night wetting. If your child asks you ""uncomfortable"" sex or other adult questions on his/her own, use this as an opportunity to have a talk about those subjects. Say the truth, though, possibly, skip some age-inappropriate facts. Use common sense. Profanity is probably a part of their lives already. Even if you don't swear, they do hear it on the street. It should be addressed very early, at 3 years of age? A kid will catch the swear words very quickly and easily. Let them know that they shouldn't be used (...too much). Perhaps, as in many things in life, it is a good idea to limit the information given to the necessary minimum and let the unimportant rest be learned through friends or Internet. As much as necessary, as little as possible. "
What to do about my toddler's fixation on the smell of her mother’s hair?,"Your daughter is exhibiting self-soothing behavior, usually more pronounced when the child is tired or falling asleep. From the AAP's healthychildren.org page on common childhood habits: Their repetitive nature suggests that they serve a soothing or calming process for the brain. Interestingly, even in adulthood many people cling to some of these self-comforting traits during times of stress: sucking on pencil tips or their fingers, pulling their earlobes, fingering their hair.  Since this is a tactile sensation, try to find a soft, silky replacement that your daughter can pull on, like a stuffed animal, a soft blanket, or a long soft-haired doll. I would wash it with your wife's shampoo/conditioner/whatever-your-wife-uses-on-her-hair and dry it before introducing it to your daughter.  With her mom's hair pulled back and out of reach, give her the toy to feel and encourage her to self-soothe on it. Model the behavior. She may not like it much and may cry, but keep trying until the habit is displaced from your wife to the object. Most likely, this will be successful; if it is not, eventually the habit will be broken, but it may take a number of tearful bedtimes. If your hair is short, you might find it helpful to put her to bed with a book and her toy. If mom isn't there, she may take to the object more quickly. In any case, it will give your wife a break."
How to handle disclosing a parent's suicide to friends and their parents,"To directly answer your question: if the topic comes up a potentially good answer would be ""well my father/husband passed away a long time ago"". The ""a long time ago"" basically indicates that this is in the past and has no immediate bearing on the present. It also indicates that the case is closed and you don't want to discuss this further. Most people will get the message. Now if you run into some insensitive idiot who still probes ""Oh wow, how did that happen"", you can easily deflect this with: ""If you don't mind I'd rather talk about something else"".  A second thought: This has obviously been a horrible experience for you and your children. Given that you posted two questions here in quick succession could be an indicator that you are still deeply struggling with this. Please make sure that you and your children get all the professional help you can to get you through this traumatic experience. Best of luck! "
My 2 year old is a bully! [duplicate],"Welcome to the ""Terrible Two's""!  Your son behaves typically for his age. At 2 he starts to assert himself and express his demands. It's likely that he has also learned that he gets his way when he throws a tantrum. For a 2-year old screaming, hitting or even biting is a normal way to express his anger - at least he will try and every success reinforces this.
He also comes across more limitations: The more he is able to do, the more often he is stopped...  The solution? It's already in your question: He will copy what others do. So by all means, stay calm. No yelling, no fussing and - please! - no hitting. He has some learning (accepted behaviour like sharing) and some unlearning (no hitting or pushing) to do and needs your help.  One afterthought: You have some serious work to do, but it will be sooooo worth it! "
How many toys are enough/ too much?,"Remember that quality is more important than quantity! I think it can be a bit easier to go overboard with toys for infants and toddlers, due to the volume you may receive from adult friends during baby showers and early birthday parties that may be more geared towards your family and friends than the baby's friends. Some toys naturally become favorites (a preferred stuffed animal, for example).  Others can be picked specifically for their educational value.  You want to make sure that whatever toys you have can keep the child's attention.  However, each child has a different attention span, so that can be hard to judge.  It can also be helpful to have something that is familiar (and therefore reassuring), such as the stereotypical ""security blanket"". The most important thing to realize is that you don't have to buy toys, ever.  There are always ways to entertain a child, regardless of the age, without going out and purchasing some fancy toy.  A big cardboard box is likely to provide as much entertainment as a $30 electronic gadget (much as I love me some electronic gadgets!), and will stimulate more use of creativity and imagination. I suggest that as your child gets older, you focus on picking toys for their meta value.  Crayons, legos, building blocks etc. are fun not for what they are, but what you can make out of them.  Particularly if you combine them with other objects (example). As for how many toys is ""too much"", I think the real issue you are asking about is more a function of how your child perceives the toys, rather than how many are there.  If your child has 200 toys, but doesn't have a huge attachment to them, shares well, and doesn't throw a tantrum when she sees one she doesn't own, then I'd say its not too many (although where and how you store them may disagree!).   Unfortunately, I've seen the opposite happen, where parents were really careful not to overwhelm their child with tons of toys, and the child wound up coveting any toys they saw, and getting really upset when told they couldn't take them all home.   Remember that the toys are marketed towards the children as much as the adults, and most manufacturers know that getting the kid to do the sales pitch for them can be the most effective method of selling their product.  Reducing exposure to commercials aimed at children's toys may help. For the record, so far one of my son's favorite toys is a remote control for a DVD player we don't use anymore."
How to explain to a 6 years old why a smart-phone is not good for her?,"Explaining a virtual world where dangers exist to a 6 year old will require a lot of comparisons to dangers in the real world. A critical part of shielding her from those dangers is limiting and monitoring her use of the device. So the easiest explanation might simply be that for her safety, you must use the phone with her, and you don’t have the time to do that yet. That doesn’t get you off the hook completely, though, as you still need to discuss dangers with her, and she might feel unimportant that you don’t have time to do something she would find enjoyable. Strangers on the internet: If she understands what strangers are in real life (most young kids don’t), then get on the internet with her. Go to any social site with a lot of users and log on. Tell her roughly how many visitors/users that site has per day. Then you might ask her if she thinks you’re friends with all of those users. Listening to her answers may help you assess her understanding of the internet and help you to teach her about strangers on the internet. When that’s settled, look at some profiles. Ask her if she would want a stranger to know that about her. Again, the concept of stranger here is critical to understand, so her answers will be a guide for you. If she’s unconcerned, that’s a whole new conversation, an extension of that about strangers in real life. Bullying is something most kids understand. You might want her to know that bullying can also occur on the internet on social media platforms and has caused a lot of sadness in many kids. That might be better saved for a few years, though. Addictive behavior may be easier to explain. Pleasure is something we all want to feel. Ice cream is great, but what would happen if you ate ice cream several times a day? Again, her answers can be a guide for you. Addiction is compulsive behavior that interferes with our lives, or more simply something we find pleasant when we do it but that is hard to stop. If she gets used to this, getting to eat ice cream several times a day, even if she’s getting, say, cavities, or can’t fit into her favorite clothes, would she really stop if the ice cream was still there? Odds are, no. Explain that she might always be thinking about it, and those thoughts would interfere with her finding pleasure in other things. Tell her that even adults can’t stop; that’s why they smoke when it’s bad for them. When they try to stop, all they can think about is how much they want “one more” cigarette. That’s addiction. If she were on the internet all the time, what other things would she miss out on? Why are those other things important? You limited your question to those specific issues, but another issue I’d be concerned about is manufacturers’ use of attractive content to prey on the desires of young people for goods or services. But that might be a question for another day. Edited to answer question in comments."
How do you handle grandparents who spoil your children?,"The best solution we've found yet is that the grands and great grands aren't allowed to skip the consequences either. No bungee-cord (grand)parenting allowed. ""If grandma and grandpa want to give you that giant plastic castle play set, then it can stay at their house so you can play with it when you visit"". ""IF grandma is going to let you skip the nap and eat a pixy stick before dinner, then she can put you to bed tonight... maybe you could sleep over with them tonight."" Worked pretty well so far. Thankfully our parents are pretty sensible and caught on quickly with just a couple conversations like that."
6YO over-reacts to minor problems,"It's pretty common for kids to lack (to some degree) resilience/distress tolerance, but fortunately this is something that can be taught. It starts with kids understanding what their emotions are-- being able to notice and name ""I am frustrated"" vs ""I am sad"" vs ""I am embarrassed"".  Overtime they can delve into more nuanced emotions, to say ""I'm excited"" and know how it's different from nervous, worried, or scared.  Knowing and naming lots of emotional states beyond just happy and sad is a skill that will improve their emotional health and ability to relate to others for a lifetime. Some simple ways to start learning this are by reading children's books about emotions, making a simple chart with a bunch of feeling words and faces so your children can mark how they feel visually (for example by pointing, or place the chart on the fridge and let them put a magnet on the face that shows their current mood), and asking questions (or making guesses) about their feelings throughout the day.  ""Are you relieved the homework is done?"", ""Are you anxious about your first airplane trip, or are you excited?  A little of both?"" You can also model emotional regulation by explaining your feelings, and healthy strategies of coping, out loud to them.  ""I really wanted to go for my run but it's raining!  I'm so disappointed!  I guess I should take a few deep breaths and then I can think of something else to do...  Hm, ok, maybe I can do a yoga video instead."" Once she knows what her feelings are, and that she can use her words to identify them, introduce some ""coping tools"" to help her tame her emotions.  There are lots of possible coping strategies, but some examples include: taking deep breaths, jumping rope or jumping on a mini trampoline, listening to music, counting to 10, splashing water on her face to 'cool down', squeezing a stress ball, cuddling a soft toy, or writing or drawing about her feelings.  It might help to have one tool that's always available to use 'on the fly' for minor upsets (like deep breaths) and something more involved to provide daily emotional comfort (like listening to music and painting). It seems that you have already noticed how much more effective validation and emotional support is, compared to reprimand, when she does have a meltdown.  In the big picture, part of the goal is to teach her to seek emotional support in a healthy way, and to essentially provide herself emotional support when the situation/upset is small enough for her to handle on her own.  When she is in tears, use supportive phrases like: Eventually, she should start to internalize the messages that it's okay to have emotions, it's not ""the end of the world"" when she experiences a negative feeling, and that her state of acute distress won't go on for too long.  Understanding that the worst and strongest experience of our bad feelings is usually short-lived and 'this too shall pass' is an important aspect of emotional resilience even as adults. As you daughter starts to understand that she can survive upsetting circumstances, you can gently introduce the question, ""Is this a big problem or a little problem?""  You can give her examples of ""little problems"" (drew a letter wrong, tried on an uncomfortable shirt, her juicebox is empty), medium problems (skinned knee, argument with a friend, lost a toy) and big problems (hurt or in danger, being bullied, something genuinely upsetting has happened).  Have her practice identifying big and small problems, and some appropriate responses to each.  For example, small problems can often be handled by letting it go, or taking a deep breath and trying again.  Medium problems may need a coping skill and perhaps help coming up with a solution, big problems usually need an adult to help. Expect it to take a while for the idea that some problems (that truly feel huge to her) are actually small to sink in, but over time she should begin to build the internal sense of a proportionate response to her situation.  Encourage her and let her know how well she's doing if she begins to use coping skills or identify reasonable responses to problems on her own.  Resist the urge to scold or react in disappointment when she doesn't- remind her that she has the tools to handle this setback, that you will help her, and that her strong feelings are not forever and will pass. For more information, you may want to investigate ""zones of regulation"", ""Building distress tolerance"" and ""building emotional resilience"", which are all related ideas but come at it from slightly different angles and schools of thought. Here's some quick links on the subject, but you can find many more online.

Bringing babies to bar?,"There's a level of disagreement about whether children should be allowed in ""adult settings,"" and you can get all sorts of opinions on what's appropriate (both for the sake of the child, and for the sake of other patrons).  Is this something people do? Yes. It's pretty unusual, but clearly not unknown or impossible. I did take an infant to a microbrewery once, but it was also a restaurant. I'd personally feel that that taking Baby to a brewpup is not a great idea, but more because I have a hard time picturing a relaxing outing with my friends while I'm taking care of Baby. When I went out with other new parents with young infants, we were grateful to leave the kid at home for a while. But not all parents approach situations the same way. What are the potential effects on the baby's health? You've mentioned that the noise level was moderate but not loud, and there was no smoking. In that case, the health risk is the same as if the woman and child went to any public business: a restaurant where no drinks are being served, or a movie theater, or the grocery store."
Is it ok for parents to kiss and romance with each other while their 2- to 8-year-old child watches?,"From everything that I can find online, it is a positive thing to show affection in front of your kids.  It models affection to your children, and it makes them feel more secure https://www.whattoexpect.com/news/first-year/how-much-pda-okay-front-baby-kids/ My own experience agrees with what I have read.  I don't think I ever even saw my father and mother kiss until I was well into my late teens.  They never showed any affection, never held hands. Of course, the problem was bigger than just their relationship.  Once we grew too old to walk on our own, my siblings and I were never hugged or kissed.  It wasn't that they were neglectful; all our needs were taken care of, my mother made sure we ate healthy, we never lacked for all the practical necessities.  But affection was never expressed. It affected us all to varying degrees.  I understand from an intellectual perspective that hugging and kissing is healthy, but I am not comfortable with it.  My daughter is a hugger, and it took her nearly ten years to train me to hug her.  My son, who is more standoffish, gets hugged by his father when he needs it but the few times that I have hugged him it feels so weird and wrong to me, because my instincts were so messed up, that I just can't bring myself to do it often.  I try, but it feels so awkward that he senses it and now that he's a teenager it's a little too late to change those patterns. I wish that my parents had hugged each other, and us, a lot more.  Please show your children that there is nothing shameful about showing affection to those you love. I have one fairly vivid memory of an insight that I gained from my mother.  She was watching one of her daughter-in-laws stretched out on the floor, and her six year old was sitting beside her, playing with her hair and snuggling.  My mother was very upset.  Offended deeply, as if they had been doing something shameful.  When I asked her why it bothered her, she was confused by my question.  I realized that it was an emotion from such a deep place inside her that she couldn't even verbalize its source.  Then it occurred to me that her own parents also completely lacked affection towards each other (they slept in separate beds for all the time that I knew them, and most of their interaction involved nagging and criticizing each other). To her, as to me, such things feel wrong.  Almost shameful. What kids learn from their parents, they pass on to their own kids.  How many generations past led to my inability to allow myself to feel affection toward my children?  It took a little girl with a great deal of innate wisdom to break my cycle."
Should I let my baby play with oranges?,"First the orange is dirty. You solve that, and only then the orange has pesticides. You solve that, and only then does the orange cause allergies. You can bet that if you proved that oranges are hypoallergenic, there would have been another objection.  Your wife does not have a problem with the orange. Something else is going on. "
How should I respond to a 6 year old's dark drawings?,"I wouldn't consider that dark. Dark would be every drawing having family members dead or something. Specific to people you know. I used to draw medieval scenes with gruesome atrocities but it was not cause I was disturbed or anything. Still got me sent to psychologists which was a complete waste of time. Should you be worried? I say no. Not yet. How should you respond? I say don't. Not yet. Now back to my own experiences - I just liked to draw. I was into knights. I drew people getting slaughtered from as far back as something like 7 or 8 years old I guess. I made flip books usually involving massacres. Lots of blood. etc. I had no resentment toward anyone. I was not angry. I was not sad. I just liked to draw and usually that's what came to mind because really think about the alternatives to young kids. My parents took me to see psychologists. That was a huge mistake. That made me mad. When I was there, I couldn't be doing what I wanted to do, which was draw. And probably draw people being murdered. The thing is they chose to focus on what I was drawing and not what I was doing with every other aspect of my day. It's not like I was capturing animals and killing them. I was building legos... usually castles and knights where lego men got slaughtered. Making cushion forts, reading comic strip books like garfield and calvin and hobbes. Basically doing what little boys do. Aside my interest in drawing murder scenes, I was normal. I would pay attention to all activities in his general day. If he has other interests, then casually think about what is thought process may be. If it all seems to point back to murder, then maybe ask a professional in child psychology. I despise and absolutely do not respect that vocation, but I'd still recommend giving it a try if you genuinely feel your kid thinks of murder all day long. Otherwise, he's just drawing what he's currently interested in."
"I want to teach my children the power of compound growth, what are some demonstrations that they can be a part of?","Here's a great way that has nothing to do with money but instead something tangible that's easier for young minds to grasp. Plants! What you want to do is get your hands on some heritage-grade seeds - the sort that will grow plants that then make their own seeds that will produce more plants. Some sort of beans might be a good choice, but look into various options and pick something that will be interesting for the whole family (ideally, something tasty). Involve them in the process of sprouting, transplanting, and caring for the plants. Explain how you are investing water, soil nutrients, time, and energy (both directly from your own work, and indirectly through exposure to the sun) to help the plant grow and make more seeds. Then when it comes time to harvest those seeds, start the process again - but this time aim to grow several more plants. They can help with more of the work during this 2nd round as they'll have already gone through the process with you once. If you have the space, you could also go with something really impacting like a fruit tree. You can get an idea of how long this takes (multiple years) from sites like this one: https://www.starkbros.com/growing-guide/article/how-many-years Over time, they'll get a valuable lesson in how setting constructive processes into play through disciplined application of inputs over the long-term can yield impressive results."
What are the pros and cons of a chicken-pox party vs immunization?,"Some people believe that obtaining the virus naturally provides better levels of immunization than you would get from the vaccine, as evidenced by the requirement for a second ""booster"" shot if you opt for the vaccine, or the possibility of still catching the disease even after receiving the vaccine (it is worth noting that infection after immunization is nearly always mild).  Although I have not been able to find conclusive evidence, there are researchers who believe that natural exposure provides higher levels of antibodies.  There is also concern that the vaccine may not provide life-long immunity, which, if true, would result in more adults catching active chicken pox infections, opening them to generally more serious and dangerous symptoms. In past years, a fairly common reason cited for chicken-pox parties is because people are concerned with the possible link between autism and immunization vaccines.  This concern was due to a study which has since been thoroughly discredited, and retracted. However, the possible benefit of deliberate exposure is speculative, whereas the risks are concrete. Deliberate exposure carries the risk of serious, or even life-threatening, complications.  These complications are much more likely in high-risk patients (pregnant women, immune-compromised, infants), but can effect even health children rarely.  Possible complications include encephalitis, pneumonia, and bacterial infection (including flesh-eating bacteria). These are admittedly rare scenarios.  However, there is one additional advantage of the vaccine over ""natural"" immunization: immunization from exposure to the active virus makes the individual susceptible to shingles.  The vaccine may not, although I found conflicting information on this.   Edit: I updated the part above to indicate conflicting data on whether you can get shingles after receiving the vaccine.  This site is a good reference for the risks of each option, but it mentions that the vaccine can still expose the person to shingles (although cases may be less frequent). Edit2: I found this article that includes a fair amount of research and citations in favor of deliberate exposure over vaccines.  However, most of what I saw in there was still what I would call speculative: the vaccine may not be as effective as claimed due to corresponding removal of reporting requirements; ""there are too many questions about the adverse effects and efficacy""; ""allegedly, [the wild version of the virus] produces much higher levels of antibodies than the vaccine""; questions about the the possible short-term nature of the immunity.   The strongest argument I saw in that article was that, if the reports suggesting that the immunity provided by the vaccine is measured in decades or less, it might result in more cases of adult chicken pox, and symptoms are generally much more severe in adults than in children.  However, the evidence supporting that argument is peppered with terms like ""unknown,"" ""theorized,"" and ""might."" Edit3: reworded to incorporate stronger supporting arguments against the vaccine earlier on."
Is 5 years old too old for a stroller?,"Yes. Five years old is way too old for a stroller. I personally think a five-year-old should be completely stroller free, not just almost. Humans are animals, just like all other animals that roam the Earth and we were given two legs to use. As such, not using them for their intended purpose leads to atrophy, decay, and laziness. Walking is exercise thus builds muscle and bone density.  If a long outing is too much, take frequent breaks. It's OK to rest. Or, if it really is too much, may those long outings should be avoided altogether. Granted, if a child has some more sort of medical condition (not disclosed in the question but just adding to be well-rounded) that limits mobility, then by all means, use a stroller. Other than that, use those legs. It's good for them. Update for if I came off as harsh. There's a fine line between not letting a child grow too quickly and spoiling them. We had a long day today. So while my son hasn't been a stroller in years, his feet do hurt. I type this while giving his little feet a massage. Force them to grow gradually but at the same time support that pressure that comes with growing."
I just learned my 15 year old daughter has come out to her friends - should I say anything to her...OR to my wife?,"I think Warren Dew offers a good answer there, but if I were in your position I'd want to let my kid immediately that I know about it, that I accept it and that it will never change my love for them (since I think this addresses her no.1 fear about sharing the information with you). Now, if you don't want to be overtly blunt, when you two are on your own you could say something like ""Did you know that your passcode spells 'I am gay'? It made me think of that t-shirt you've bought recently... Were you trying to tell us something?"". If you say it the right way, in a friendly, fatherly tone and with a big smile, I think she'll be thrilled and relieved to finally share it with you."
"My 5 year old successfully built a Lego set Porsche made for 18+ completely by himself, What can I do to use his gift in some way? What does this mean","First, if you can, buy more LEGO sets, regardless of the recommended age.  Don't worry about buying a set that's too complicated: challenge is good, and will help your child learn to deal with struggle and success. Second, from my own personal experience with my nephew, and how his talents were encouraged, I would suggest you tie your child's LEGO projects in to all of the areas of learning that are age-appropriate. I say this because my sister and her husband allowed their gifted son to only work in the area where he excelled, and by doing this, their son fell behind in developing other necessary skills. For example, my nephew learned to read very early, and because his parents allowed him to read most of the time, my nephew's fine motor skills were neglected and the dispairity between his reading skills and drawing skills was an embarassment to him once he started school. One way you can ballance your child's learning is to give them a LEGO set to build, then ask them to tell you a story about the LEGO set (verbal skills, story telling, vocabulary), and draw pictures of the LEGO set (fine motor skills), and stage mulitple LEGO sets to create a scene (imagination). You could also work with your child to create multiple scenes, take pictures of them, and put them together to create a book, either on screen, or print the pictures and staple pages together. Creating books is a wonderful activity for all children. Third, if you feel your child is gifted, knowing that as early as possible in their childhood has benefits. Gifted children are often lopsided in their development, which can be very confusing to parents and teachers, since it's their emotional development that lags behind their intellectual development. Gifted children have special needs, and the sooner a gifted child is identified, the sooner parents and teachers can address their needs and create a healthy home/school environment for the gifted child. This article goes into depth about the social-emotional needs of gifted children. Parenting the Exceptional Social-Emotional Needs of Gifted and Talented Children: What Do We Know?"
What action should I take upon learning that boys are wolf-whistling girls in my daughter's class?,"I agree that 5 yo boys who wolf whistle are probably just proud to show off a skill they've imitated to the level of mastery. They would probably turn a shade of green if they understood all the implications a wolf whistle carries. However, there is an appropriate way to whistle and an inappropriate one, and it's the parent's job, as well as the teacher's job as one in loco parentis, to teach that concept. The explanation need be no more complicated than, ""That's not considered polite/respectful."" If my daughter were in that class, I would begin by speaking with the teacher to see what page they were on. If they agree, great! If they don't, and/or they do nothing, there isn't much you can do, especially if your daughter doesn't object. If the parent is a friend, you might bring it up with them in private. If not, probably best to just drop it. (""Pick your battles"" applies to adults, too.) But the parenting part of this is to help your own daughters to understand why wolf whistling is impolite at a level they can understand, and to help them frame/learn and practice their responses to this. Give them a voice and the knowledge that it's fine, and appropriate, to use it. They are fortunate in having a father who cares about them as deeply as you obviously do."
How do I get my 6-month-old to sleep better at night?,"Establish a routine Yes, it's a Supernanny favourite, but we've found that a consistent routine (even printed out and stuck to the wall in vibrant colours) helps children to understand the wake-play-eat-play-bedtime-sleep cycle. The biggest challenge to introducing a routine is when the children rail against it. This requires a lot of patience and understanding - they don't want to be told what to do all the time and will try all sorts of antics to get around the routine, but stick to it rigidly and it'll pay dividends. Some of the important ingredients of the routine:"
My 13 year old daughter says she wants to be a boy. This is out of character for her. Is this a phase?,"Preface
The topic of teens wanting to change genders is a very delicate one and also one without much information available.  There are plenty of people who want to argue their ideological viewpoint, but that isn't helpful when you're dealing with a real situation with someone you love.   The key term being discussed is Gender Dysphoria.   Gender Dysphoria involves a conflict between a person's physical or
  assigned gender and the gender with which he/she/they identify An Article in Quillette, which I think your daughter should read, states: In the past decade, however, a new presentation of gender dysphoria
  has suddenly become widespread, in which teens or tweens come to
  identify as transgender “out of the blue,” without any childhood
  history of feeling uncomfortable with their sex. Experts have dubbed
  this presentation rapid onset gender dysphoria, and are beginning to
  study it. The American Psychiatric Association states  For many children the feelings do not continue into adolescence and
  adulthood. WebMD states People with gender dysphoria have higher rates of mental health
  conditions The previous 3 statements are not made for any other reason than to point out the seriousness, complexity, and the gentleness that this issue should be taken with.  They also both serve as further resources a reader may use to do their own research. With this minimal amount of information about the topic I'd like to offer some reasonable information on how to handle it.  I'm going to the anecdotal research by a Social Worker with experience in these issues.  The source information is not a long read and I suggest you simply go read it yourself.  There are 2 posts that discuss having a teen with Gender Dysphoria (the author is the same author who wrote the article in Quillette above):
Part 1
Part 2 Summary
Don't fall into the trap arguing about gender dysphoria.  Keep in mind how much you love your child as you go through this.  Try to ask questions and understand why your child feels this way.   The ideology of innate gender identity doesn’t make much sense of a
  lot of the time, and many young people seem to sense this At all costs avoid shaming or punishing your child over gender identity.  At the same time, you can choose to not agree to the identity.  Choosing your response needs to be a unique choice based on personal information no one here will have.  Part 1 discusses this in more detail. Challenging a child’s beliefs should always be done without anger. As
  much as possible, it ought to be done respectfully and with genuine
  empathy for the child’s suffering. Some parents have had good success
  with carefully timed, short reality-based statements, delivered with
  authority but not anger Remember children are children because they simply are not ready to live on their own. They don't know enough and they are not mature enough.  It is your responsibility to be in charge and keep your child safe during this time. It is really hard to research this stuff on your own when your world feels like it is falling apart.  I genuinely believe the content posted by Lisa Marchiano in the 3 main links is reasonable.  It is also all I have been able to find.  This is a very new phenomenon. Note on Social Media
There is strong evidence about the negative influence of social media on teens and tweens.  That is not the main topic at hand, but from your question it seems to be a major impact on this specific situation.  There are other questions which have answers to this topic. More Personal to you
I could give you many more opinions, but there are many questions.  I wonder how much you know about the therapist you've chosen, how much you know about what your daughter does on social media, and of course what core issues were that led to the therapist in the first place.  There is a lot for you to unpack, my questions are rhetorical for you to answer. Appendix 1: American Academy of Pediatrics
Further reading is a PDF printed by the Children's Hospital of Chicago by the American Academy of Pediatrics.  They officially support Affirming gender change in children, however there is a group of pediatricians who actively reject that position. At the least, if your daughter does start to consider therapy in the future with or without your consent, please review pages 39-41 and see the side effects of testosterone therapy.

Polycythemia (increase change of heart attacks, blood clots, and more)
Increased risk for breast cancer
Increased risk of Endometrial cancer   Post Research Note
It appears there is a good amount of support for Gender Dysphoria in some national groups like the APA.  However, no reading of the definition of Gender Dysphoria has shown to be anything other than supporting what people feel.  I cannot find genuine objective information on the topic. Post Research Note 2
Parenting Stack Exchange is not the place for questioning the topic of Gender Dysphoria in general.  I opened a self-admittedly long winded question on the Psychology & Neuroscience Stack Exchange site where I address some of my concerns over the general validity of the APA holding a stance that supports and affirms gender reassignment, especially in children. Post Research Note 3
I think there is a huge gap between the reality of this topic and how we talk about and understand it.  I have posted a position on this gap at the Psychology & Neuroscience Stack Exchange site here."
What are some milestones a child should reach before learning programming?,"As a programmer I would propose to you the following: Abstract thinking, Pragmatic Thinking, Higher problem solving. Design Patterns (Not programming in general but building. Building in sense of building, construction. Did you know that design patterns come from designing buildings and problem solving in engineering?) Also I would recommend starting with the famous little programming language for kids: Logo. There are actually pretty good games to get your kid started. But you can Google that so I wont bother copying in those results. Your main goal is getting his attention and getting him to think like a programmer, or at least start to think like one. After that you can start with applying the knowledge to algorithm and lower problem solving and object oriented programming. Also I would recommend using Mind Maps, since kids tend to remember shining colorful things better. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map As a kid I loved automating everything. That's why I'm an automation test engineer today. It might be fun to show your kid how you can automate tasks. How you can manipulate the windows, and everything what you PC does. Also some real world interaction like OCR with a video feed perhaps. Or a basic motion tracking system with a cheap camera. I think the kid would be very happy if for example he could spot if his parents are nearing his room. Or build a little LEGO robot and program a routine into him, like go get me milk. Which is difficult but get's him started and will have a goal too and a real life experience which is VERY important in the early years. See : Lego Mind Storm: http://mindstorms.lego.com/en-us/Default.aspx"
How should a parent advise a child who wants to become a musician even though he is devoid of talent?,"As rumtscho commented, how do you know the child has no talent? And how do you know they won't end up selling a million records? Take the Sex Pistols as an example - when they started they couldn't play or sing and sounded awful, but were incredibly enthusiastic and became stars. Everyone starts off sounding like they are strangling a cat, or destroying the instrument! At this stage I'd suggest encouraging your child is more important than putting them down. You could suggest some structured tuition, as this can set them on the right track to learning properly. After a while, get a professional music tutor's opinion on their capability.  Or alternatively, get them an electric instrument that can be played through headphones. Either way, be supportive, positive and enthusiastic for them if it is something they love doing - they may change their mind later anyway, and decide they hate it. But that's much better being self driven."
How to deal with my 12 year old son being allegedly caught cheating at school,"First, I would (as Becuzz mentioned) sit down with him and hear his side of the story.  It may be that he was cheating, and in this case, if he seems properly repentant and embarrassed, you might work out a punishment that fits the crime better than taking away his X-Box.  Enlist the teacher's help with this.  Maybe doing an extra paper, or some other task that would be enough work to let him know he's being punished.  See if there's the option of retaking the test.  It might be that the embarrassment of being singled out for a punitive test would be punishment enough. However, don't just accept the teacher's statement without investigating things yourself.  My husband once told me a story about how he got 100% on a test and received an F.  The teacher said it was because he had cheated.  His mother got involved and questioned the teacher, who finally admitted that my husband had accidentally been given a test for two grade levels above his own, and the teacher assumed he couldn't have gotten the score he got without getting the answers from an older friend.  Nope.  He was just very good at math.  The teacher at first refused to let him retake the test, but once his parents got the school board involved he was allowed to retake it.  In a room by himself.  Aced it. Another thing you might consider...straight A students often feel a great deal of pressure to continue to perform at that level.  Once you have dealt with the current problem, be sure to let him know that while doing his best is important, the grades are only an indicator, not the goal.  And not all subjects are the same...students who are good at math may not do as well at English, and vice versa.  As a child goes up in levels, just being smart and working hard may not be enough any more.  It needs to be okay to fail a little, as long as you are sure that he is putting his best effort into school."
Is punishment necessary?,"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1118118/ In the only published review (in 1996) of child outcomes of non-abusive or customary physical punishment, only eight studies could disentangle the causal effects of smacking. All eight studies, including four randomised clinical trials, found that nonabusive smacking benefited children when it backed up milder disciplinary tactics with children aged 2 to 6 years. Eighteen studies in the 1996 review investigated alternative disciplinary tactics as well as smacking. Only grounding was more effective than smacking, in two studies of older children. In contrast, nine alternatives were associated with more detrimental outcomes in children than was smacking. Based on the research I could find, it seems that some kind of reasonable punishments for misbehaving children (including physical punishment like ""smacking"") are generally better than the alternatives. I think the point here is to use appropriate, fair punishments as the situation warrants with your child. The idea of no consequences for misbehavior definitely seems misguided to me! However there is also data to support the idea that physical punishments can definitely become harmful as children get older, so be careful: http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/09/090915100953.htm Using data collected in two longitudinal studies—one of almost 500 children who were followed from ages 5 to 16, the other of more than 250 children followed from ages 5 to 15—the researchers sought to answer questions of how discipline changes during childhood and adolescence, and whether there are factors within families and children that are associated with these changes. They find that parents typically adjust the way they discipline their children in response to their children's growing cognitive abilities, using less physical discipline (spanking, slapping, hitting with an object) over time. As children grow older, physical discipline becomes less developmentally appropriate. However, when parents' use of physical discipline continues through childhood, by the time their children are teens, they're more likely to have behavior problems. Teens of parents who stop using physical discipline when their children are young are less likely to have these behavior problems."
How can I tactfully ask that people refrain from giving religious items at a baby shower?,"As the other answers suggested, it's very likely that whatever you put will come of as weird. Still, it's an honest and reasonable sentiment, so it's kind of frustrating that it can't be expressed as such. Here's my best effort (to be placed in relatively small print at the bottom of the invitation): The language is a little stale, but I think it's a reasonable start. At the very least you want to avoid anything that comes off judgmental towards Christians; saying ""we're atheists"" is too blunt, it only matters what you're not. Also, I've started with a selfless message to soften the blow, and couched it in other language about what gifts are likely to be used. This way, it hopefully comes across as an afterthought: something you might as well put down, since you're mentioning gifts anyway. It's probably better to risk insulting people by not using their religious gift than to risk insulting them up-front by telling them to keep it at home, but for what it's worth."
My son started kindergarten and doesn't like writing his name. How should I think about this?,"First, I would ask him about why he doesn't like writing his name.  Is it boring?  Is it too hard?  Is it too repetitive?  Etc.  Once you know why he doesn't like it, you can work on helping him, either by working with the teacher/school to make adjustments or by helping him practice or otherwise addressing the issue. If I were to hazard a guess, it sounds like he might be bored.  You stated he already knows how to write his name.  And now he's getting a lot of practice he probably doesn't need, so it feels mindlessly dull to be forced to do it over and over.  And over.  And over.  And... Kindergarten is unfortunately where a teacher gets a group of kids with a wide range of abilities.  Some kids are pretty far along because of preschool, very involved parents, etc.  Others may not have had any of that.  Most are probably somewhere in the middle.  But your son's teacher has to teach to the lowest common denominator.  He/she can't skip teaching how to write names just because your son already knows it because there are others who don't.  So he's going to have to learn to deal with it somehow.  You can work with him to give him tools to combat the boredom (which will serve him well throughout his life as this will certainly happen again).  You can also try asking the school to give him something a little more challenging so things aren't so dull and he can learn something. Again, before you try anything, ask him what's going on.  He's old enough he can express some of his feelings.  You may need to help or dig if/when his emotional vocabulary is lacking.  But he should be able to tell you.  And if all else fails, see if you can observe class one day.  It might give you some insights into where the problem lies."
Should the nanny quit when the parents don't care about their dangerous children?,"Leave.  Leave now. There's clearly something seriously wrong.  Whether it's bad parenting, a psychological disorder, or something else entirely, it is beyond your control and you are liable for the welfare and actions of the children in your charge.  Don't end up under criminal neglect charges or worse because you can't change the situation. If you suspect criminal abuse/neglect is going on, report the parents to the appropriate authorities. You will take a career hit by leaving, but far less than the one you would take for having someone sue you, or press criminal charges, for something that happens here.  Being the nanny who walked away from a bad situation without a reference is a lot better than being the nanny whose 8yo charge stabbed another child, and with three in your charge you can't have hold of all of them at once.   Rules of good behavior aren't just for the caregiver's sanity, it's for the children's safety!"
Should 18+ kids still have a tight schema for bed and PC-usage?,"When legally adult children continue to live with their parents, they implicitly accept to live by the rules of the house because they are legally free to choose to move out and live by their own rules.  The times you mention seem on the conservative side to me. I'm sure your parents mean well but if you want to change things then I would start by figuring out how those limits came to be and exactly what their purpose or goal was then. Perhaps the rules no longer exactly match the goal they have in mind for you. If your education requires you to be awake and present at 07:00 (several medical educations have that) then going to bed at 22:30 seems reasonable and you should recognize this. If you need to be there at nine then the bedtime is admittedly too early... Limiting your computer time depends on what you use the computer for. If your parents  know that you only play silly games or surf questionable content, then they'd have a point that it's not helping you anyway. A shared computer in a community area where late use would disturb other members of the household could be another potential reason to restrict its use. If that's not the case, then make an argument what constructive things you could do in the evenings and see what their objections actually are. In summary, I would say that you need to understand what your parents' reasoning is. Once you understand their point of view and their concerns,  you can prepare a case for yourself. So: first talk to them but don't argue, and then at another time talk to them again and make your case.   If you can find a good compromise, fine!  If not, decide or discuss what your options would be."
How soon until I can take my newborn to take a walk outside?,"This pamphlet, put out by the South Carolina Department of Health, suggests it is safe at one month. You should avoid large crowds, but the fresh air and stimulation is good for baby. You should probably not allow people to touch your baby's hands (since baby may put them in his mouth). Your greater concern in going outside is the weather - keeping baby warm/cool enough and avoiding too much direct exposure to sun.  Personally, in a non-crowded situation, I would not hesitate to take the baby for a walk as soon as I felt up to it - usually within days of birth."
"My husband (her father) jokes/plays in ways my daughter doesn't always find funny, he says he should be able to do it if he wants","In this case, your husband is not behaving like a mature adult, or how a good parent should behave towards a child. Your stand on the issue - to interfere on the part of your daughter - is not only correct, but your responsibility as a loving and concerned parent. It sounds like your husband values being a playful guy, which is fine if the child's feelings are taken into account. But because it's always fun for him, he can't seem to understand that it's not always fun for everyone. It also seems that he takes the rejection of it personally, and blame-shifts onto a 5 year old (""...he should be able to do as he pleases in his own home and she should get over it."") He says sometimes she doesn't mind him doing it, and how is he supposed to know if she'll get upset or not. By reading her body language. If he gets into a crouch position and she smiles or laughs, it's fine to move forward. If she looks tired, frightened or tense, it's not. If he's unsure, wait a while until she seems relaxed. This is what your child will learn/is learning from his behavior: his feelings matter more than hers. It might even go as far as her feelings don't matter. As kids tend to think the world revolves around them, when something is wrong, they tend to blame themselves; they tend to experience negativity/criticism not as a reflection on a discrete character trait (e.g. bravery/perseverance/resilience) but on their inherent ""goodness"". This self-blame can develop into low self-esteem and problems later in life, especially if it's frequent and across several or more aspects. A well known example similar to this is tickling. There is welcome, loving tickling and there is abusive tickling. Adults like to tickle kids because we like to hear their laughter, and interpret their laughter as joy. Kids enjoy the attention of their parents, the physical contact, the roughhousing, and the sensation of being tickled to a point. At some point, tickling becomes uncomfortable. It becomes so uncomfortable that it was used through the ages in different cultures as a form of punishment/torture on adults. Most parents are aware of abusive tickling and give the child some power in this very unequal dynamic: stops to check in with the child, and a safety word, or ""Stop"", which is consistently respected by ""the tickle monster"". Perhaps this is how your husband was raised, so it's his default setting, or he may be lacking the empathy needed to see this issue from your daughter's perspective. Either way, it will damage his relationship with his daughter to some degree.* It may be that this is the only situation in which your daughter's feelings are disregarded. If so, repeated explanations that what she feels, no matter if he thinks it's appropriate or not, is as valid as his own feelings, and if he values having his feelings taken into consideration, so will his daughter, even (maybe especially) at the tender age of 5 may do the job. If you see other evidence of this lack of empathy with your child, he may need a third party to intervene: her physician, your pastor, or someone else whose opinion he respects, even a family therapist if his dismissal of her feelings is across much of the board. Edited to add: In light of your husband's difficult childhood, he may be overly focused on bringing joy to your daughter's life, something he himself missed out on. It doesn't change anything in the answer, but I would add an explanation to your husband that joy can be experienced in ways not expressed by laughter, and laughter does not always mean joy (see tickling.) He's not failing to bring joy by failing to make her laugh. Respecting her feelings and making home a safe haven for her may bring her a serenity/happiness he also missed out on as a child. Ask him to picture how he would have felt if his parents cared about/were attentive to/respected his feelings as a child. That might be helpful. (Joy elicits a feel-good reaction in your husband because he can see it and he is rewarded as well for it. Happiness/serenity isn't as visible, and doesn't bring on the same experience, but is just as important for her well-being.) Have you ever asked him exactly how she should go about ""getting over it""? What are the steps she should take? If he can't come up with a better plan than ""she just should"", seeing how this is not a reasonable expectation may be helpful. *When I was a child, my father used to tickle us mercilessly, ignoring our cries to cry to stop until the laughter turned to sobbing, at which point he would get angry and walk away while muttering criticisms at the tearful victim. It was awful, and I hated it. He disregarded our feelings in many many ways, and I had a very tenuous relationship with him as an adult. What I didn't realize until decades later was that my father lacked empathy to a degree which was pathological. He just didn't understand on a deep emotional level that what he thought/felt/believed wasn't what everybody thought/felt/believed (or should have done so.) 6 Ways Childhood Abuse and Neglect Leads to Self-Blame in Adulthood"
Should Disney princess movies be avoided?,"I agree that there may be an issue here - ie, some Disney movies perpetuate gender stereotypes, gender roles, and other things that aren't good things to perpetuate.  However, I feel like this is similar to the censorship debate, in that simply not letting your kid watch them is not the right answer.  Your kid will be exposed to similar issues whether or not he/she watches Disney movies; and his/her friends will undoubtedly watch them.  I've known plenty of people who were avid anti-Disney folks whose kids couldn't get enough.  Rather than censoring, use the movies (and shows) for good. What Disney movies provide is a forum to discuss these topics.  Avoiding problems I find to be a poor way to deal with them; it's not like gender stereotypes would go away if you just stopped watching Snow White.  Instead, watch the movies and talk about it afterwards.  Watch Frozen, where a girl does the saving - and really nobody saves anyone - despite the guy doing the normal white knight bit, amusingly turning the Disney white knight meme on its head.   Talking about these movies, especially as your children grow into sufficient maturity to understand these issues (likely earlier than you expect), is the best way to deal with them.  Avoiding a topic rather than discussing it hurts your child(ren)'s intellectual growth, and they certainly will be exposed to the ideas anyway; it's not substantially different from drugs or sex, after all, in that you are better off discussing them at appropriate maturity levels rather than avoiding them entirely.  On the other hand, exposing them to a variety of different viewpoints makes conversation possible about those different concepts and allows you to address the parts that concern you. I see action movies the same way, honestly; they're usually some guy going around and saving people through strong man type tactics, or James Bond breaking all the rules to save the girl, or similar.  These aren't any better, and should encourage the same kind of discussion.  Their main benefit is they're not something you'd show to a young kid. David adds in comments a good point, that you in discussing the movies, you can also consider the original sources for many of them.  Frozen for example is based on a very different story (The Snow Queen) with a very different message in many ways - and is a sister saving a brother, ultimately.   Both have interesting and good messages, and both have weaknesses; discussing them in tandem could be an excellent starting point."
How to deal with my 2-year-old daughter crying and getting angry when we don't give her what she asks for?,"This is a difficult problem for parents because we hate making our children cry, but it seems to me that you use 'the naughty place' / timeout and that can be effective. I don't call it 'the naughty place'. As difficult as it is when your child cries, sometimes it is your job to be firm. At two, she is trying to assert herself. This is a normal part of development and is a good sign. Timeout: Timeout is not a punishment. It is a stop action, relax and get-over-it place. It is quiet. Some parents have to sit with their children. In my opinion, it is only effective some of the time as the child has to cooperate. Redirection: Redirection is also not punishment. It means (more or less) changing the subject. In this example, you remove the phone, and say firmly, ""No,"" Then you put on some music, sing or dance,  or pull out a game or activity. If you get good at redirection, it is magic because the child hardly notices they don't have the 'phone'. Working for tokens: The token system (stickers, check marks) can be as formal or as casual as you like. Every time period (you select the amount of time) she earns a token for good behaviour. The tokens 'buy' her something she likes at the end of the day. Perhaps it is a walk before bedtime, some time on the playground, painting with mum or  dad, 5 minutes of TV for every token up to the amount of time you allow TV. Everytime she is naughty, you give her a firm, ""No."" and remove a token. She will soon understand that she wants tokens. I also think she has arrived at the time when she must be given choices. Choices help her to feel like she has some control and also teaches her to make decisions. You offer her the red or the blue cup. ""Your choice, do you want red or blue?"" She selects and you say, ""You chose the red cup."" It isn't more than two items and you have pre-selected the choices, so that whatever she decides is fine with you. This happens all day every time it is possible. Cookie/pudding. Red/blue shirt. This/that game. Swing/slide. Use the choosing language and it will help. When it is your choice, you say, ""This time it is my choice. I choose that you cannot play with my phone. It is not your toy."" By the way, don't let her play with your phone some of the time if it is a problem most of the time. They are expensive and not toys!"
How can I stop my two year old from taking off his diaper in bed?,"Take a one-piece pajama, the sort with long arms and legs, but without feet, that has a zipper running from one leg to the top, and put it on backwards.  It's completely tamper-proof, easy to ""service"", and ought to be equally comfortable. We have tried many of the other suggestions (diaper backwards, onesie, onesie plus some kind of trousers, ""duck"" tape, sleeping bag), but they were all found out after a short while.  If he gets the backwards pajamas off, he'll be ready to join a circus."
Is TV harmful to my infant's development?,"In summary, research findings to date might suggest a correlation between television viewing and developmental problems, but they cannot show causality. There is no evidence that television, even educational programming, has any positive effect on children younger than 2 years old.  In fact, some studies suggest it may be harmful. According to the above AAP media release: To be beneficial, children need to understand the content of programs and pay attention to it. Children older than 2 years and those younger than 2 years are at different levels of cognitive development and process information differently.10 In fact, 2 studies have found that watching a program such as “Sesame Street” has a negative effect on language for children younger than 2 years,11,12 and 2 studies have found no evidence of benefit.13,14 There is a paucity of research on this topic, but the existing literature suggests that media use does not promote language skills in this age group. Studies have shown that children under the age of 2 generally do not understand what is being shown on television, and, while there is conflicting information on whether or not they can learn anything useful from television, even the studies that show some learning indicate that the learning is less than would be obtained from comparable ""live"" interactions. The concerns are stronger in the area of language development.  This TED talk describes how minimal the impact of television on a toddler's language development is (2% as effective as a real person).  In addition, a television being on generally reduces the amount of language interactions the baby has with the parents, as, at best, both the baby and the parents will be distracted by the television, and at worst the parents will use the television as an opportunity to engage in activities that do not involve the baby. Again from the AAP media release: A study that examined 12-, 24-, and 36-month-olds found that background television not only reduced the length of time that a child played but also that it reduced the child's focused attention during play.34 Children stop to look at a televised program, halt their ongoing play, and move on to a different activity after the interruption.34 Although most research has been performed on adolescents, study results suggest that background media might interfere with cognitive processing, memory, and reading comprehension. However: Only 1 research study, conducted in 1996, resulted in evidence to the contrary. In that study, 10-month-old infants tuned out surrounding noise and concentrated more during play.37 More study results: Since 1999, 3 studies have evaluated the effects of heavy television use on language development in children 8 to 16 months of age. In the short-term, children younger than 2 years who watch more television or videos have expressive language delays,12,43,44 and children younger than 1 year with heavy television viewing who are watching alone have a significantly higher chance of having a language delay.44 Although the long-term effects on language skills remain unknown, the evidence of short-term effects is concerning."
How to explain Paris terrorist attack to primary school age children?,"I've got a hard time explaining the motives of the terrorists. I don't know whether this is the best article on the subject (it's near the top of this Google search) but for example What Motivates Terrorists? starts with, One of the most frequently asked questions about terrorism is also the most intractable. Why? Why do they do it? Why do people join terrorist groups and participate in acts of terrorism? There are as many answers to this question as there are terrorist groups, and everyone from clerics to caustic cab drivers seems to have a confident opinion on the subject, as though the interior world of terrorists can be easily mined and mapped. But this confidence is often misplaced, given how little scholars actually know about terrorism and the people who are involved in it. It also betrays an epic obliviousness about just how difficult it is to access the internal, subjective desires and emotions that shape the outer world. Another article at the top of that Google search is ""What ISIS Really Wants"" which claims to describe the group's ideology, but even if that's true I guess that the group ideology isn't the individuals' motives. Because it's difficult for you to know, beware it's likely (or certain) that if you try to explain it then you'll tell some untruth or oversimplification or stereotype (which I think you should avoid when explaining the world to children, notwithstanding the Lie to children concept). In particular it might be better to (or I might prefer to) avoid teaching xenophobia, for example, or avoid mis-explaining a ""religious"" doctrine that you don't personally understand and which isn't a real motive in your world. So, instead of guessing terrorists' motives, perhaps an explanation like the following, of things you do know be true: Then you can turn the conversation to what they need to know: Because they already know it happened and they want to know why, if it can happen again, if it can happen here, etc. I can only suggest what I see as truthful answers: Some corollaries: They have obviously noticed the media reports and they saw our local TV tower lit up red-white-blue today You could use that to explain solidarity. Maybe spare a thought too for the (constant) victims of war in other countries; and/or the role that the media plays in war (and how the media reacts to terrorism, and that affects the media's consumers)."
"My toddler has started ""lying""","Lying is actually a key developmental milestone. A quick quote from Wellspringutah: when a young child tells a lie, it is helpful for parents to remind themselves that it is not as much a crisis of morality as it is a signal of an important emerging developmental milestone. It might be a bit much to say that it is cause for celebration when a child tells his first lie, but it does show that the child is maturing cognitively. Lying demonstrates that a child is acquiring what child development specialists call “theory of mind. and Research has shown that deception starts in children between two and three years of age and that there is a marked increase between three and five years of age in a child’s use and understanding of deceptive strategies So don't worry about it - in fact worry if they don't ever try this - but help them understand why lying is not a good practice through discussion."
For the benefit of the child: what's better - no father or bad father?,"I won't answer everything (short version - I think you're doing the right thing on most levels). Do NOT badmouth the ex in front of the son. You made a very wise choice! For one thing, it won't really help you long term. Second, it may cause damage to his own self-image as a man long term. For another, if you ever meet a man you want to be involved with romantically, he will find it one less worry about you (""if she badmouths her ex to her son, what if we have a child together and divorce, I'd get the same treatment""). Third, your son when he grows up will appreciate that you let him come up with his own conclusions. Don't let the ex near if he's truly a bad juju. Drugs, alcohol abuse, threats of violence. If you filed a restraining order for valid reasons, they are even more important reasons when it comes to your child's safety. Make it clear that it's not HIS fault the father isn't around. As he grows older, start explaining the real situation. Be honest about WHY you made up a white lie earlier (""it is hard to explain to 3 year old what a drug addict is"") and apologize for any white lies. But 3 suggestion I would make would be to Put a high priority on finding a good father figure for your child. This does NOT need to be your romantic partner. It can be a male family member (your side, or in some rare cases even your ex's side if he's the weird one of the family). It can be a male friend. It can be a father of your kid's playmates.  That's one thing that godfathers used to be for, but that doesn't seem to be a popular institution anymore these days. Ensure the ex pays child support.  Find a parenting ""buddy"". Ideally male, it doesn't much matter (full disclosure: idea stolen from my work's parent support group), but someone who is a parent, single or not. This would be simply someone to listen to you. Hear out your rants. Serve as sounding board. Someone who you can tell your frustrations without bottling them up. Someone to offer advice as an outsider after hearing you out. Someone to validate the calls you make that you aren't sure about. Opposite gender works better since they will provide a different perspective."
Telling a child about a playmate's death,"It's absolutely tragic to have a child die. Your daughter should tell her son asap that the 8-year-old child has died.  Yes, it's hard to have that conversation, because there's no easy way to talk about a child dying. For a 4½-year-old, I would recommend that you tell your grandson that the child was involved in an accident and died. Be prepared to explain what death is, and avoid things like ""he's sleeping.""  You can explain that while we are alive our heart beats, we breathe, and we need to eat and drink because food is fuel for our bodies. A concrete explanation of death could be a simple statement how this 8-year-old was in an accident that caused his heart to stop beating. Death is a natural part of life, and be prepared to reassure your grandson that you and your daughter are going to be alive for a long time. From there I think your grandson will have questions, and I would suggest that you not give details about the accident other than general info like it happened at the lake. Lastly, include a discussion about your feelings about the death of this child and death in general, and explain that after a death people have different ways of showing their sadness and grief, and that it's okay for him and other children to feel sad and also to run and play and have fun."
Getting a 2-year-old back to sleep in the middle of the night,I've been there before. My son was over a year old before he started sleeping through the night. Here are my suggestions:
What's an appropriate age for a Swiss Army Knife?,"This one may be a challenge - UK laws on knife carrying are not age-related (although there is an age limit on purchasing knives) but they are related to size of knife and to some extent what you are doing with it and where you are carrying it. Personally I think a Swiss Army Knife is appropriate for outdoorsy kids from an early age - whenever they can safely handle one - so I'm happy mine have had them from 7 or 8. They whittle spears, roofing spars, traps, toy boats etc from them, and when camping they are incredibly useful. But I would not allow them to take a penknife to school or down the high street. There is no need for one in those situations, and the temptation to show one as a status symbol is very likely to lead to trouble.  In summary, if your child is likely to be able to handle a knife, I see nothing wrong in letting them have one in the right environment - ie camping or going on a hike where they may need it. Give them some training on use, and some first aid training - it's almost a rite of passage to accidentally cut yourself with your first knife :-)"
What do I do to get my nine-year old boy off books with pictures and onto books with text content?,"So it looks like you have two questions, how to foster a love of reading and how to get your son to start reading more reading-level appropriate books (that phrasing was chosen carefully, I'll get to that in a moment). As far as fostering a love of reading goes, it sounds to me like your son already has that.  If he enjoys reading, no matter the book, that is good.  I repeat, reading anything is something to encourage.  Nothing kills all desire to read like feeling forced to read something that you hate or is boring.  Don't force your son into anything he isn't ready for or isn't interested in.  You will just shoot yourself in the foot by making him not want to read text based books as well as what you called kiddy books. As far as getting him to read more reading level appropriate books, that depends a bit on how opposed you are to certain things.  In my opinion not all books with pictures are necessarily of a lower reading level.  Graphic novels, comics and some books with lots of illustrations can be complex, can cover interesting and thought provoking topics.  So maybe finding more reading level appropriate materials for your son doesn't have to be about avoiding pictures, just finding different books.  (For example, I worked with 8 - 11 year olds for a while, many of them loved Captain Underpants.  Many loved Diary of A Wimpy Kid.  You could ask a librarian (or maybe a school librarian) what they would recommend.  I'm sure they know more than I do about what might work.) Whether you are opposed to illustrations or not, whatever you help your son find (it can't be you dictating what is to be read, he needs a say in it) needs to be something he's interested in.  If he finds a story he can really get into it probably won't matter much whether there are pictures or not, he'll want to read.  So try to figure out what he's into or what is popular and give those things a shot.  And if they don't go over well, quit early and try something else (ie. don't be stubborn and force reading a boring book just because you started it, move on to something better quickly)."
How do you feed a picky eater?,"My five kids range from ""ultra picky"" to ""eat only healthy foods"" to ""surprise, I've changed my likes and dislikes"".  Keep healthy foods around, so their choices are all generally healthy. Keep reintroducing new foods that they wouldn't eat within a reasonably close timeframe. Sometimes it takes 7-8 tries. Try different ways of preparing the same foods. Try to make the food look inviting to a kid (make a smiley face out of the vegetables). Give much praise when they try something new. When your kid(s) are listening, tell other people how much your kids love trying new foods. Make trying new things an exciting experience. Try eating a bit of the food with them at the same time. Say, ""Let's do this together! I'll have a bite with you!"".  Sometimes, its futile, but they still need to know that you're in charge, so I'm definitely an advocate of forcing them to at least have a bite of each thing on their plate. If they don't, we use a standard timeout regime just like anything else: warning, ultimatum, timeout for one minute / year of age, apology, sit back down and eat what I told you to eat. Side note: Don't praise multiple helpings, even if the food they're eating multiple helpings of is healthy. Just praise that they tried it. Praising a second or third helping encourages overeating.

What are reasons for setting a teen bedtime,"It sounds like there are a couple things going on here, from your answers to the comments. Item #1 is a dead end. No teen in the world will ever care what the proper bed time is. You can try any form of command you like, she will sleep on her own schedule regardless.  Item #2 is what you should approach her with. The key is that you not say when she needs to go to bed - we've already established this is not within your control. A commenter pointed this out, but I'll reiterate because it's true: if you want to influence her behavior you need to give her a reason. Want to entice her to wake up? How about a family waffle making contest - to be judged at 10am? Be prepared for negotiation. Maybe waking up for waffles isn't important to her, and she'd rather enter a taco contest to be judged at 1 instead.  It's important to be honest about what you want, and if what you want is unreasonable then you should expect her not to care. She won't care that at some nebulous time in her maybe-future she will need to wake up at 6 am. If that's true, why not maximize sleep now while she has the chance? I'd start with: ""I'd like to do something fun with you tomorrow, but you'll have to wake up in the morning - 'cause otherwise you'll miss it.""  An astute reader will notice that this plan only works for one day - unless you like waffles enough to eat them every morning. You'll have to have a new family activity every day! Think about why she should change her behavior if you aren't going to do the same. "
I think my 11 month old is afraid of his dad,"You are in a tough situation. Having to share parenting with someone you hate is very difficult. And whenever anyone upsets your child, it's natural to want to prevent that. Let me make some suggestions for you. If the dad stops hitting the baby, stops taking him away crying, and learns how to meet the baby's needs, it's possible they will develop a good relationship and the baby won't be scared of him. It's also possible the dad will decide that seeing the baby is way too much trouble with your new rules. But if he does that will be his choice, and not your fault. Showing up to scare, hit, and yell at a little baby is not really being a parent anyway."
Is there a benefit or harm in letting a 3 year old control her own bedtime routine?,"3 years old is a prime time for children to assert their independence, developmentally they understand they are separate entities from everyone else. With some kids, choices are key. Many are extremely motivated to do something as long as it is in their own way.  I would recommend that you don't allow her to decide for herself, but give her meaningful choices. This can involve things like 'do you want to brush your teeth or get a story first?', 'Do you want to brush your teeth naked or in your pajamas?', 'Choose two story books', 'Do you want snack or bath first' and so forth.  Simply decide what is not a choice, such as brushing teeth and bedtime.  I agree with others that you definitely don't need to bathe a toddler everyday, they don't have 'smelly sweating' like adults, and their skin benefits from not getting a bath every day.  The short answer to your question is:
No, within limits giving her say in her bedtime routine is empowering and helpful."
Too many presents from Grandma - is this bad for my child?,"I think that having a lot of things for your baby or kid is not a good thing, like toys or any other distraction (ipad, presents, bad food with sugar). This could create a behavior of only doing minimal effort to get what you want in life.  Hold on, these are not all correlated to behavior. If you don't want your kid to play on an iPad, don't give them an iPad. If you don't want your kid eating sugar, don't give them sugar. These aren't life lessons, they are rules. Not raising an entitled or spoiled child has nothing to do with X number of toys they have or what they are given. Rich children that have everything they want can grow up to have a work ethic and empathy, and poor children can still be raised as spoiled brats depending on the lessons and reinforcement you provide.  Having lots of any one thing doesn't lump your child into an arbitrary category. What will is the direction you provide while they grow up. Grandma can give all the toys she wants, but a spoiled child comes not from random gifts, it comes from when you take them to a store or toy store, they grab something they want and throw a fit until you give in. It comes from them bending the rules and knowing they can break them or not keep up their end of the deal. It comes from knowing consequences won't be enforced. Not to sound harsh, but your child is 1. Having a million dollars worth of toys from Grandma is not even going to register as a blip right now, and she certainly isn't going to learn about giving minimal effort from an excess of toys. The idea of behavior comes not from any physical item they are allowed to have, iPad, toys, whatever, it comes from the lessons that are reinforced and the boundaries that are made when encountering situations as they grow up which you provide a teachable moment and stick to your guns. Sugar in general is different just because you don't want to rot the child's teeth out, but even a cookie once in a while isn't going to hurt anything. Let children be children but steer them as a parent to make good choices when you can. If you arbitrarily set limits on everything they do in life, they are going to grow up with bitterness and animosity towards YOU, and things like that lead to them acting out when they get in a situation where they can do as they please. I think parents in general can get too absorbed in the whats and the limits as a means to an end, aka a well adjusted person, and not focus on the ideas behind actions that lead to that. "
How and when should I tell my son that his amazing father isn't his biological father?,"My approach is not much different than what I'd suggest for plain vanilla everyday families: Why not supplement the biology part with a discussion of what makes a father a father or 
the fundamental difference between producing and raising a child?  IMHO, every child's education on sex should include these aspects. We want to raise responsible adults, not just inform them on the human reproductive system. There are so many children that are raised by step- or foster parents, by family members or friends. Children are conceived thanks to medical assistance and egg- or sperm donors. It takes a village, they say... And we are so much more than our genetic make up. Your son's situation and history is unique to him, but by no means unheard of. Lay the groundwork of these ideas and values, then follow up whenever more technical details fit in. Catch ""occasions"" over the next few years, a few random examples could be: Perhaps you are shattering the image of ""man & woman -> love -> marriage -> kids -> happily ever after"" a bit sooner than you intended to, but rest assured, most observant children of your son's age will have noticed by now that reality works differently on occasion. But please spare him the gruesome details for now. Stick to neutral answers like ""your bio-dad lives far away"" or ""your bio-dad doesn't want to visit"", even admit that you don't know some details (like why his bio-dad doesn't want him) or that you will tell him more when you think he can understand better, but don't lie. He will ask for more information as he gets a older, then tell him in an age-appropriate way. This is where telling the truth pays off: You don't have to worry whether your storry adds up. If he catches you lying, this may severely damage his trust in you. In case whether you wonder if its a good idea to tell your son his story: 
The mistakes we make and admit do not make us inferior, what we make of them counts. You got a wonderful son and a stable marriage out of a bad situation and should be proud of it."
Child refuses to accept being wrong,"Man, I feel for you. My son is the same age and does the same exact kind of thing. You're not a control freak. You're a dad who cares about how his son interacts with the world. You see him developing habits that seem harmful for his future. In comments, you mentioned that you used to do the same thing. You probably can think of situations where that ended up being a detriment to you personally, and you want better than that for him. I have worked with people who wouldn't accept that they were wrong. People died because of it. When my son, who is too smart for his own good, continues to willfully ignore the very obvious truth in front of him, I tell him to say something really simple like ""Oops, I made a mistake."" Everyone is wrong sometimes! Then I drop it, because it takes two to argue. The good news is that you grew out of it, so he probably will too. You are responding to him patiently, even though you don't feel like it. You're doing a good job."
What are the psychological impacts of a split-religion household?,"My wife is religious. I am atheist. Our kids seem fine. They go to church with her and learn bible stories. If they ask me questions, I answer honestly. Usually ""well, some people think that, some people don't"" I'd say there is little to worry about psychologically. Having MORE religious point of views in a household seems less harmful than only one domineering one. If anything, it'll get them thinking. "
5 yr old's toy taken by a another kid,"This is a great teachable moment, both for your daughter and the other child. First - talk with her about the risks of bringing things she cares about to school.  I would usually not recommend having kids take things they care about to school - not because I think the other kids will be bad per se, but it's just too likely to lose things, accidentally break things, etc.  But - it's her choice, for the most part; obviously with your limits preventing her from taking something inappropriate or too expensive to risk.  Don't blame her for this happening - it's not her fault!  But, she should keep this in mind when making choices in the future. Second - she should talk to the child tomorrow, and ask her if she brought it back.  If not, she should ask if the other child can please bring it back.  This is the first step - as it would be for an adult, too! If it doesn't come back the next day, then it would be appropriate to ask the parents of the child if they could help her out.  Don't be confrontational - after all there's a good chance this was accidental, and even if it wasn't, there's no real value in being confrontational.  Just ask if they can help her remember to bring back your daughter's toy that she accidentally took home. If you don't know the parents, you can ask the teacher to help you contact them, or maybe talk to them at pickup if that's possible.  Again, not confrontationally - just fixing the problem. There's a nonzero chance though that the toy is lost - the child may have brought it home and then lost track of it, or lost it in the car or who knows where - it's something that happens with children.  If the parents aren't able, or willing, to help you, then you may have to make your peace with the loss, and help your daughter do the same. One side note: ""Pop-its"" are very commonly used with children with autism or sensory disorders.  If this is why your daughter brings it with her - if it's basically a therapeutic device - this changes things slightly.  In that case I would still have her ask the child, but I would also probably involve the teacher - not necessarily to retrieve it, but to watch and help your daughter out in the future avoid issues like this."
How do you explain to a five year-old what energy is?,"These other answers seem too abstract for a 5-year-old. I don't think he's ready for that yet. Stick to the visible and concrete. Take him outside and show him the power cables going to your house, that lead into your fusebox/meter.  Show him the meter moving. Explain to him that there's a company that makes electricity (not quite the right words scientifically, but let's keep it simple) and sends it to you over those wires. Those wires then go into the house, to the outlets where you plug things in.  Things like the blender; the computer, and bigger stuff like the oven and water heater. As you use electricity, the meter counts how much and then the company sends you a bill. Show him the bill. If you want to get a bit more eco-friendly, mention to him that the company that makes the electricity does it by burning coal and we want to minimize that, too. "
How to raise a child between agnostic parent and believer relatives?,"Speaking as an atheist whose child has religious grandparents, my method has been to put religion on a par with any other choice in life and not elevate it to have any special place as more or less important than a great many other choices in life. If someone believes in God and wants you to do the same, then it's up to you to decide if you want to.  It's no different to me than having a friend/neighbour/relative who supports sports team A, and wants your child to do the same.  The child should be presented with the knowledge that such things are personal choices, without judging that choice.  I explained to my child that her grandparents believe in God and go to church, I also explained that I do not, and I backed it up by saying it's just what we have chosen to do, no-one is right or wrong in their beliefs, so when they send her religious materials at Christmas and all that I don't deride them, I simply use it as a real life example about how everyone is different. Until such time as they can make such a decision independently, it's simply unfair to attempt to force them to believe anything that they don't naturally have a tendency to do so.  You wouldn't force a child to change his favourite colour because your parents prefer Green, in fact you simply wouldn't try to enforce any preferred colour, you just explain that there are all these different ones, and you can prefer what you like, and furthermore you can change your mind at any time, no one choice is correct. I personally would steer away from any talk of gas chambers, by the time they are in any way prepared to be faced with such a concept, much less understand it, they will likely be old enough to have started to make their own choices anyway.  And, as you say, you only recently changed your own mind, so don't expect a kid to live through life with what he first is presented with. A more important lesson when it comes to the grades thing and all that is that the only people who can help in such matters are the child themselves, and the teachers/friends/relative they are surrounded with.  There is simply no replacement for trying your best, and no amount of praying/hoping/wishing/begging (whatever you prefer to call it) is going to make up for not doing so. As for Fairy Tales etc, kids don''t (in my experience) tend to believe what they see quite so rigidly as we might think as adults.  There is no need to explain that cats don't talk should they see a cartoon with a talking cat.  Tooth fairys, elves, pokemon etc etc, this list goes on.  Ignore the medium, concentrate on the message - if a cartoon is about being friends, that's what you talk about, not the fact that the people being freinds are 1 eyed fluffy aliens who don't really exist.  It's the same with the Christmas stories I get given for my child, the message is more important than the scenery, so you can take values of kindness, charity and so on from a story, without them having to believe in (for example) Noah's Ark, or 3 wise men etc."
What should I consider when deciding whether to homeschool my child?,"These must be considered, but please make sure to read the Pros as well. For us, they make the disadvantages well worth it. Learning outside of a school environment can consume a lot of mom or dad's time. Most people probably picture that time being spent at the kitchen table with textbooks and worksheets, but from what I've been reading, that is not how it works for many families. Many families choose more hands-on learning styles that include field trips, experiments and educational activities - this has certainly been true in our house. However, planning, driving to, and participating in those activities (or waiting for them to be over) often becomes the bulk of a homeschooling parent's day. There are predesigned curricula that can be purchased that help to alleviate this time pressure but they are usually costly (K12 is a public-charter school and free option in many states www.k12.com). Such programs also do not entirely erase the time needed to help guide your child through his/her education and they do not make up for the fact that your child who would otherwise be spending 6.5 or more hours of the day out of your home at school is now in your home needing a certain amount of time and attention from you during the day that otherwise might be provided by teachers and peers. One single homeschooling mom, Mickey, wrote to the website listed below to say that single parents who home school their kids face even greater time restraints: ""We have to be very creative in our timing because I work and home school. Luckily, I work close to home and have a lot of time off, but it's still a challenge."" The amazing part though - it is possible! You may be the best expert on your individual child, but teachers can be a wonderful asset and very reassuring when it comes to questions about what is ""normal"" for a given age. As a teacher I have reassured countless numbers of parents that forgetfulness is in fact a symptom of adolescence and perfectly normal for 12 and 13 year-old children to honestly experience. Then, I give them (the kids) the tools that are needed in order to operate around their forgetfulness and both parents and myself insist upon their use. As a parent, it was nice to know from a teacher who had years of experience with four - year- olds that it is pretty normal for a four year old to be obsessed with death when I became concerned that my daughter seemed over-focused on this topic. However, there are many homeschooling support groups and blogs etc. that can provide this resource in a slightly different way. Teachers also have a lot more experience in methods and may be better equipped to offer up secondary activities when a student becomes ""stuck"" on a subject that are more in line with a given learning modality or style for the individual. Again the many support groups for home schooling parents may be able to offer similar support. Foregoing full-time employment out of the home in order to home school for at least one parent or guardian is common in families that use homeschooling (but some manage to homeschool while still working full time so it is possible). This can be a big sacrifice for families who are struggling to balance their budget (I know, I'm in one of them). Also, depending on how you home school, materials, books and educational etceteras can add up fast. However, the amount of expenditures in the home school do not make a big difference in the success of the student in that home - no more so than a kid in a mortar and brick school with high income earners at home has an advantage over his/her peers. Most books about homeschooling (many of which will be available for free at your public library) will include a chapter or section on homeschooling on a budget. There are also a lot of resources online to help with tips to minimize these expenses should you decide to go this route. For those of you in one of the 30 some odd states covered by k12 (link in paragraph above) this really is a fabulous resource should you enroll in their ""Virtual School"". There's no denying it — if you choose to home school, you're going to be with your kids most of the time. This can be a blessing and a curse. If you don't enjoy being together, then homeschooling can help repair damaged relationships and create improvement in your relationship with eachother - or it can make things worse. While it can sometimes be difficult, most home school parents I've read about or with whom I have spoken, view their daily interactions with their kids — the ups as well as the downs — as opportunities for personal and familial growth. If you do not consider yourself as someone with a good sense of humor, moderate amount of patience and do not enjoy the process of learning new things and exploring topics with your child/children, homeschooling may not be the right option for you. While community sports activities fill the void for younger kids, teens often find limited opportunities to join sports teams, club sports exist in some places but not everywhere and this can be an issue for the especially competitive ones. Depending on where you live, home schoolers may or may not be welcome to participate on teams with their public-schooled peers. Several parents did mention that a few families overcame this problem by creating their own teams. There are also families that home school up until the teen years and then switch to mortar and brick for this reason alone. Like any activity that is not mainstream, homeschooling will seem like a strange decision to many, or even as a threat to some. Your extended family members, friends and even acquaintances will likely have opinions they will feel the need to express - and not always in a loving and open way. Many of the families I've read about, met and spoken with, struggle with this in the first few years. Luckily, we have mostly avoided this issue, however there are a few key things to know that can help in these types of conversations. These points are covered in the ""pros"" section. Family members that are harsh at first, often come around by the third or fourth year as they see the home schooled child/children developing normally or developing as advanced over the years. If you see this as a potential battle for you that you are unprepared to persevere through, homeschooling may not be the best option for you. The reason I can include this in the pros and not the cons is that this is actually a myth. In most homeschooling cases, children are exposed to a much more diverse array of social situations. For more information about this, there are books and links listed below. The belief that children who are home schooled will come out of it socially backward or unaware is one of those things ""dissenters"" will commonly claim as a reason your child should be in school. While children can be ""sheltered"" in the homeschooling environment in such a way as to prevent certain developments, this is a rarity, not the norm.  As you'll see mentioned below, home schooled kids have more time for valuable extra-curricular interactions that involve their own peer group in a setting of common interests. These settings are much more similar to the workplace setting because even in a workplace, the members of that community at the very least have a common skill set. In a career environment, they are likely to share some interests as well. When we choose a career, interests and skills are both considered. It also sets kids up in a positive environment where the team or club is working toward common goals rather than competing with each-other for having needs met and with disparate values and goals. Additionally, home schooling allows for more time for children to be socialized in how to interact with members of the community in a variety of roles and ages. This actually results in generally more respectful and socialized teens and young adults than their mortar and brick schooled counterparts. Home schoolers are known for having a good work-ethic, being more capable of self-direction, and more able to work with bosses and colleagues in a work environment at an earlier age (78% of home schooled teens hold jobs outside the home environment and are successful in their respective workplaces). Teens that are home schooled generally have more time to try entering the work force and learning from the experience. While I taught middle school, I personally encountered a few students that had been home schooled until they reached middle school and found themselves in my classroom. All of these students were favored by their peers, their teachers, and mentors that ran clubs they were involved in. These students were able to be academically successful while still being ""cool"". Additionally, I found this article online that is a brief summary of what I have found said over and over again in every book I've read about it. The article I'm citing here summarizes what was consistently stated in all the books I have read about homeschooling.  Check out http://www.hslda.org/docs/nche/000000/00000068.asp for access to a more elaborate and academic summary of studies on social development in the home-schooled child. However, I suggest skipping the first couple of paragraphs as the authors do make some sweeping negative claims about mortar-and-brick schools they do NOT take the time to back up with research. The remaining information below these first few paragraphs includes references to psychological and statistical studies that support the idea that homeschooling either, causes no harm to social development in kids, or even, enhances social development. It was the briefest academic summary I found online. This article provides a summary of developing information on the subject in a very accessible way that does not pound our mortar and brick school settings into the ground. http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/dec/13/home-schooling-socialization-not-problem/ There are more and you can also find further information here To some extent, home schooled students have the choice to study and learn what they want, when they want and as deeply as they want and when they are developmentally ready rather than when the system says they should be ready based on averages. Each state has a set of basic expectations of material covered hence the ""to a certain extent"". For example, in most states you won't be able to just decide to forgo Language Arts altogether (would you want to?). But those basics may be covered at age six for one child, and at age ten for another, depending on ability, and maturity. The ancillary subject matter becomes much more free though. For example, if you have a budding musician you might teach fractions by discussing rhythm and its notation rather than pizza and pie slices. Parents who home school say they experience a real sense of freedom. With their lives no longer revolving around school hours, homework, and the school calendar, these families plan off-season vacations, visit parks and museums during the week when such places are less crowded, and live their lives according to what works for them rather than what works for the school. It also results in more access to extra-curriculars. Because it requires less time to learn skills and subject matter in the home school environment than it does in the mortar and brick environment, your child will have more time for scouting, 4-H, clubs, sports and arts activities such as singing, acting or learning how to play a musical instrument. Sadly, peer pressure, competition, boredom, and bullies — are all part of a typical school day. This can be a particular problem for girls. According to studies, self-esteem plummets in middle-school girls. Even the most well-adjusted girls with the most supportive parents and families can have severe struggles navigating the school's social environment (which contrary to belief is NOT like the real-world). However, similar studies of home schooled girls have shown that self-esteem remains intact and that these girls continue to thrive. (Read A Sense of Self: Listening to Home schooled Adolescent Girls by Susannah Sheffer.) Home schooled kids can dress and act and think the way they want and is right for them rather than having to ""fit in"" to the dress code and values of their friends at school without fear of ridicule.  They live in the real world, where lives aren't dictated by adolescent trends and dangerous experimentation. Even grocery shopping offers up certain socialization opportunities as it provides children with a model of how to interact with others within the store layout as well as the cashier or any other workers that might help in finding a specific product. Most home schooled kids have many more of these ""real world"" kinds of encounters than do their mortar-and-brick schooled counterparts. Home schooled children also usually have a lot more to say in who they spend their time with and wind up having peers that are friends based on common skills or interests rather than just their age. Traditionally schooled children have peers that are friends but they also have a lot of other kinds of peers that exert a less-positive kind of influence or result in less-positive relationships. Many families feel their religious and spiritual beliefs are an important part of who they are. Homeschooling as well as parochial mortar and brick settings provide the opportunity for parents to incorporate their beliefs into their children's daily lives. Just about every homeschooling family that has been interviewed for the plethora of books and articles I read during my months of research and consideration before choosing this route for my child, stress the important role that homeschooling played in helping them find time to foster loving ties between all family members. There is a lessened competition for time between homework and family time, time for chores etc. This happens because in some senses they all become one-in-the same. Teens seem to benefit enormously from this interaction, and rebellious, destructive behavior often begins to diminish soon after homeschooling begins for those families that enter into a homeschooling situation in the later school years. In families that began homeschooling before the teen years began, there is less incidence of rebellion (I'm really sorry, I don't remember which sources illucidated this, but I believe unschooling.com has a little about it). Although separate study time must be set aside for strictly being devoted to the learning process and practice for new information and skills, many school topics can even be discussed and taught while family members cook dinner or wash dishes. You can also more easily introduce efficient units of study that are cross-curricular. For example, while studying ancient Greece, you can also study Homer (Literature), The rich and varied art of the age, and various principles and inventions in mathematics and geometry (Euclid, Archimede's Screw etc.) Homeschooling is a wonderful option for families on the move. I've read descriptions of how stabilizing homeschooling can be (because the curriculum stays consistent) for these families. Military families are particularly likely to benefit because of this. As more and more studies are illustrating, sleep is vital to the emotional and physical well-being of kids, especially teens and preteens. Preteens actually need almost as much sleep as a kindergartner because of the amount of growing going on within their changing bodies. The effects of early morning classes can be devastating to many children. Up too late and too early the next morning, these kids are not in a mental state appropriate to effective learning. In a home school environment, it is still important to get all your work done and this can mean hours of work, but if something is happening in life that means sleeping in is the healthiest choice, adjustments to the schedule can be made and both sleep and academic needs can be met. It is also important not to allow these fluctuations too often, for too long because changing sleep patterns can have a profound effect on grades, emotional well-being, mood and the social well-being of a preteen or teen with her/his peers. However, in the home school, the schedule is yours to set and it is only the needs of family members that must be considered, not the needs of the masses at hand.  Home schooled children can accomplish in a few hours what takes a typical classroom a few days or more to cover. In a recent interview, John Taylor Gatto, New York City Teacher of the Year and a 26-year teaching veteran, said that in many classrooms less than one hour out of each school day is spent on ""on task"" learning. Even in the most efficient classrooms, teachers are attempting to cover material in as many learning styles as possible under budget, legal, administrative and skill constraints. Even when ""on task"" many of the items and activities that are done are not conducive to your child's learning style and his or her learning the material. No wonder these kids have so much homework. And that brings us to a major ""pro"" of homeschooling: No more homework! (Well, maybe all of it becomes homework - but there will be time to do it because your kids aren't wasting time on whatever irrelevant thing kids in a mortar and brick environment are waiting on that day). I have occasionally referred to schooling in a public or private school here as ""traditional schooling"". Schools as we know them are really something that has only developed in this country during the last 100 - 150 years. Prior to that, the majority of students attended one-roomed schoolhouses with a mixed range of ages and abilities or were schooled at home. Many of our pioneers had to home school because of geographic isolation (My father was one of these in his early years in Alaska while it was still a territory). This country has actually been founded on the backs of many men and women that were home schooled. Many of our founding fathers were schooled in the home. The change toward emphasizing a more structured and standardized education that has occurred in this country has mostly been to the advancement of our society and I agree that public schools as well as private have a lot of advantages to offer up. However, in reality they are neither more traditional than homeschooling nor exclusively and always better for everyone."
What to do when my 3-year-old holds poop in and won't go in diaper or on potty?,"You are dealing with two issues here: stool toileting refusal and the associated constipation.  Constipation:  Your doctor is probably recommending an enema because an impaction is preventing defecation at this point. I have an acquaintance who has had success in this same situation using a commercial suppository that is administered by eyedropper – you could ask your doctor about it – it may be easier to administer than enema. The impacted feces may smell very bad, and it is important not to react negatively to it (see below). Continue working with your doctor regarding Miralax usage. Some children stay on it for years; your decisions regarding this should be guided by medical practitioners. In addition to Miralax, increase the fiber in your son’s diet (fruits, fruit juices, vegetables, bran and other whole grains), reduce milk products, and increase his water intake.  Stool toileting refusal:
This is a behavioral/psychological issue – about 1 in 5 children go through periods of stool toileting refusal. There are varying theories about the cause, and it may be that there are varying causes (all theories being possibilities). It may be caused by constipation (painful defecation means refusing to defecate), associated with the arrival of a younger sibling (a regressive behavior), triggered by parental or societal negative views toward feces (using negative words like “stinky” to refer to it), or precipitated by being pushed before being ready due to the escalating demands of modern life (like the need to be ready for preschool). It is hard to know exactly what your child’s thinking is, but in his mind he may believe that in holding it in he may be able to stop it forever. At this stage of cognitive development, your son will not be able to understand that stool that is withheld will accumulate, so trying to explain it will not help. Because this behavior began while still in diapers, it suggests that he has developed negative feelings about it.  He may have become aware of negative connotations toward feces through societal or parental verbal or nonverbal signals, resulting in shame and embarrassment when he defecates. In a study where parents were taught to praise defecation and avoid using negative terms for feces, the period of stool toileting refusal was shortened (Taubman, Blum, and Nemeth).  I reviewed a number of articles, the most relevant of which are cited below. Suggestions culled from them which might be of help: Best of luck!

What are some ways to teach a child how to spit (after brushing their teeth)?,"Interesting problem.  If it were my son, I would try with water.  Take a mouthful, swish around, spit.  Repeat.  Try to make a game out of it.  See if he can hit a cup in the sink or something.  If this works, move onto toothpaste.  Do the exact same thing.  Take a mouthful of water, swish, spit."
In Rural India; 14 yo daughter broke her friendship due to her feelings on homosexuality. What to do?,"I applaud your intention.  Please note that my answer here does not take into account what may be appropriate in your culture as I am not familiar with its norms. Our initial reaction(s) to seeing something may not always be the reaction we will have in the future.  And, as the saying goes, we fear what we do not know.  To overcome this, we need to look at the issue in greater depth -- I research both the pro & con sides to all issues, chat with friends, and try to look at all the various facets of an issue before coming to a decision... one cannot simply read an article on any website and feel that they ""know"" the subject. Hopefully those points of discussion will help.  When it is all said and done, though, she will end up deciding her view for herself.  Whether you agree or disagree, you will have done what you can to help guide her into a critical thinking role. Just please remember that ""force and mind are opposites"" (quoting Ayn Rand) -- if you try to force her to think a way, her view will not change on the subject and will likely harden as a reaction to the attempted force."
What studies exist regarding computer usage and computer game playing that support limiting access?,"Although I don't claim expertise in the subject, there appear to be two functional sides to the debate between violent behavior and violent video games, with varying amounts of evidence to support either side. Side saying video games causes aggression It has been demonstrated in many experimental psychological studies that even brief exposure to violent media tends to have measurable effects on aggressive behavior. Behavior should be used slightly loosely here though, frequently measures of behavior are survey responses (e.g. given this situation would you punch this person) or some other controlled situation that is difficult to relate to behavior in normal human interactions. This is then theoretically interpreted as, well slight exposure to violence can cause appreciable effects on aggression in the short run, so likely more long term exposure can theoretically cause individuals to become more aggressive and have more dramatic effects on behavior. Then apparently some studies have shown for observational samples that children who play more violent video games tend to be more violent. Side saying there is unlikely any connection Most of the critiques against the connections between violent video games and violence are in general critiques of the observational associations. So, unlike the experiments in which we can randomly pick a group of kids to expose to violence in a movie or a video game for an hour or two, we can't randomly expose kids to video games for a long time. No one is saying if you play a video game once you are going to get in fights on the playground, it is long term exposure we are talking about. So, the observational studies survey a group of kids, and ask them how often they play video games, and then ask them if they get in fights or other measures of violent behavior. The problem with this logic is though, the kids who choose to play violent video games likely differ from kids who do not play violent video games on a host of other characteristics besides playing video games. It is just as likely that kids who are already more aggressive are drawn to play violent video games. Long story short, IMO, there is strong empirical evidence linking short term exposure to  violent media and indirect measures of aggression in short time periods after being exposed. Where the evidence is lacking is the connection between long term exposure and real changes in behavior. The observational studies trying to establish this relationship are far from convincing. Now, I have picked information up from various articles related to my field and just general news articles on the subject (so feel free to not take my word for it, and do some digging yourself). There is alot of stuff floating around the internet, and general searches would turn up a ton of material. One of the most recent popular papers on the Social Science Research Network was a paper Now this isn't peer-reviewed, but the authors are credentialed. And you can always do a general search yourself for peer reviewed papers on Google Scholar. Just a simple search for violent video game brings up several highly cited papers and meta-analysis on the topic. This same question was also brought up on the skeptics site, Do violent video games cause violent behavior?, although those responses don't cite any more sources (besides wikipedia) than I am. I realize this is more specific than you are asking for. But this is likely the most popular topic connecting game playing to behavior, and many of the same types of critiques connecting other game playing to behavior or health (such as lack of activity and obesity) can be applied in a similar manner."
"How can we manage our adult son taking back an item we confiscated, without our knowledge, when he has moved out?","You say you ""helped your son pay"" for the device. That implies that it is your son who was buying the device, making him its owner, and that is the understanding of the transaction that you yourself entertained. Confiscating it because of it being used opposite to house rules does not put it in your possession, like a teacher confiscating a device considered not to be brought to school would not become its owner. He moved out. I cannot see that he can be seen as ""stealing"" a device that is his to start with. He took it from your desk drawer. That's a breach of the privacy of your desk. It does not appear like you were intending to give back his property on your own and he was probably tired of arguing with you over it. Personally, I don't think you have anything to gain by painting this as a ""theft"". Your son is an adult, and messing around with his property, including property you helped him acquire, is not your business. Any confrontation here would erase any trace of ""lingering guilt"" he might entertain and replace it with anger at you. Your resentment seems to be based off ""he lied to you"" but you make it sound like you set him up for it. Would he have gotten off any better if he had told you the truth? It does not sound like it. Parents not being able to deal reasonably with the truth make lying sort-of mandatory. The cost of occasionally being caught is the lesser price to pay than that of being forthright. If you are going to be punished anyway, why not lie and get off occasionally? Your opportunity for education is mostly over. Most of what you try now will impact the quality of your ongoing relationship more than it will impact his behavior. I'd suggest not wasting your remaining influence on this."
How to tell my 4-year-old son not to get hyper with his uncle or anyone except parents?,"Kids are going to be kids. There is a lot of social etiquette and nuance that they will learn as they gain experience. Four years old is not the time. You should not place this burden on your child at such a young age. Using terms of today, this is Victim Blaming 101. The aggressor (the 28-yo that is yelling at a child) should be the one that is reprimanded, not the victim (the child). There are many courses of action here, but it should be clear to you that your question should instead focus on how to change the 28-yo's behaviour, not your child's. Tell the adult that it is not appropriate to yell at your son, and suggest alternate methods of communication. There are many parenting books and resources out there that will provide excellent alternatives to yelling. If the adult cannot follow through (or refuses to follow through), simply do not spend time with them. Social consequences are a strong driving factor for behavioural changes; if the adult values time with you and your family, they will change."
"I'm doing work that should get me some money, but my parents don't pay me for the work I do and I don't like that. How should I deal with this?","TL:DR: Life isn't fair; someday soon, you will be the one supporting yourself and deciding how to spend your time. Until then, try to negotiate the best deal you can for yourself while meeting some of your parents' needs.  If you end up in a win-lose situation, analyze your options and how best to bide your time. First, let's get one issue out of the way: Is it wrong of me to feel taken advantage of since I'm basically doing free labor? Feelings are just reactive emotions; there is no right or wrong ""feeling"", as opposed to an action. Assigning a moral value to them - either yourself or your parents - is anxiogenic if judged to be negative and doesn't really help anyone. It deflects focus on the issue to an indefensible position.* So, you feel taken advantage of, full stop. It's fine to stop there and live with it for a while. It's also true of for your parents' feelings about things. Feelings aren't facts. You can argue with facts but you can't argue about what someone should feel. Am I supposed to be glad for all the skills I'm learning and animals we have? Irrelevant; see above. When you disagree with a someone, analyze the situation rationally first, then discuss concretes. Analysis also helps to modulate emotions. In the US, a handyman earns anywhere from $45 to $80 an hour. The more valuable the skill (an electrician makes more money than someone doing lawn maintenance), the higher the wage. In your situation, you are saving your parents x dollars an hour depending on the service you are providing. This is something concrete that  you (plural) can verify easily. It's also a verifiable fact that you are costing your parents money. You can figure out roughly what you cost them in (your share of the) food, clothing, housing, education (public education is supported in part by school taxes), utilities (electricity, water/sewer, gas) and sundries (computer, phone, internet, gasoline/transportation, actual parental educational tutoring [i.e. homework help], meal prep, ""allowance"", etc.) Be thorough, logical, and ethical in your approach; suspend entitlement ** to anything for this exercise. Weighing the value of your monthly service against the cost of your physical existence is a helpful fact to hold. Then, having facts in hand, approach your parents for a calm, reasonable, respectful discussion. This only works if respect goes both ways. If your parents think you ""owe"" them 75% of your free time without discussion or agreement, that's neither reasonable/supportable nor respectful. The rest is negotiation; aim for win-win outcomes. I'm fairly certain that your cost of living is less than the cost of your labor.  Knowing by how much is a valuable negotiating tool. One of the many wrenches which can derail negotiation will be ethical, and as such, subject to cultural influences. Do you owe your parents/family unit anything? Do they owe you compensation for ""pain and suffering"" (frequently moving you around, affecting friendship/social structure)? (Ideally these have been discussed and agreed upon beforehand.) If negotiations are unproductive or, worse, nonexistent, what options do you have, and how do you feel about them? Could you move in with your grandparents/would you want to? Can you strike out on your own now? Face possibilities as facts, not impossibilities. Good luck with all this; you're in a difficult situation. Use this as practice for adulthood. I know that sounds trite, but your very posting here is you flexing your adulthood muscles. Edited to add: If the feelings thing sounds dismissive, it's not intended to. You feel what you feel; it's somewhat like feeling hunger. If you're hungry three hours after a meal and you tell someone you're hungry, it's silly for them to say, ""You just ate three hours ago. You are wrong to feel hungry."" As an adult, you'll need to examine issues and decide for yourself - without external validation - what is a reasonable position to take when you feel something. It takes experience, mistakes, and reflection to learn to trust yourself enough to sit with your actual feelings. I hope that makes sense. *Instead of arguing the merits of an issue - e.g. if you have a right to fair compensation for your work - you're wasting time and emotional energy on a something basic and instinctual. **In reality, as @dxh correctly points out you, are legally and morally entitled to certain things, but arguing from that vantage point becomes more subjective and less helpful. I was born into a ""difficult"" family, one parent (violent) with mental illness and alcoholism, the other with major depression. It wasn't fair, but that didn't alter my reality. I found a way to get through it and learned to take care of myself. Aim for the best you can for now."
"What can I tell and what can I ask of a 2nd grade teacher, about my child's health?","Ask yourself:
If you were the teacher, would you rather be warned or find yourself suddenly facing a 2nd grader with a full-blown asthma attack? I don't think your request is unreasonable. And you are not expecting her to watch your son like a hawk, or do something super-taxing, but just to be aware of a special situation. If you phrase your request politely and express your appreciation of what she already does as nicely as in this question, I see no problem at all."
"Should we force our slightly-autistic son to have hobbies (other than ""computer usage"") which will allow him to socialize more?","From what you're writing, you don't really want him to get any hobby, but a hobby where he can socialize. If he's slightly autistic, socializing is the hardest thing for him to do. And it will be even harder if the socializing is in a context where he has nothing to talk about or isn't interested in the things people talk about. You said he likes to use the computer. So basically he already has a hobby! I'd recommend exploiting that and not view it as something negative. You can have computers, and/or some more specialized area in computers, as a hobby that is social. There are many activities involving computers. LAN parties, clubs, associations, forums; there are lots and lots of communities involving tech-interested people. I would try to have activities in not too large groups. At least give lots of opportunities for 1 on 1 socializing. Large groups can be intimidating and just cause him to go silent or worse. I'd be very careful trying to create an interest where there isn't any. It could create resentment and not any real interest. I'm not saying not try new things, but don't push it too much. Use what he's already interested in and focus that energy into something more social."
How do I make my kids love reading?,"First off, I'd recommend you change your language some.  ""How do I make my kids..."" never ends well.  Your kids are their own people, and they'll choose to like, or not like, things; trying to ""make them"" like things is a fool's errand that will more often than not make them dislike that thing. However, I've been where you are.  I wanted to figure out how to help my kids learn to love reading.  What helped me: The main thing, though, is to keep your ego out of it, and let them be the children they want to be.  Make it easy for them to learn to love reading, and maybe they will!  Or maybe they won't, and they'll end up doing something totally different, and that's okay, too."
Mom too worried with germs and disease,Babies/children build up their immune systems by being exposed to germs and dirt. Keeping them away from germs and dirt actually gives them a weaker immune system. (http://www.webmd.com/parenting/d2n-stopping-germs-12/kids-and-dirt-germs) This is not to say that you should bring your baby hang out with plague victims. Some germs (mold etc) can make baby really sick. The following web page gives some sensible guidelines: http://www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/germs-and-babies.aspx
We're looking to get pregnant - what can we do to optimize our chances?,"My wife is a doctor and we spent some time planning pregnancy and making sure we had the best chances. We were surrounded by people who had been trying for a long time with no success and we asked them - in intimate detail - about their health, lifestyles, times and dates of lovemaking, family history, etc. We compiled all the evidence and built a plan. It revolves around capitalising on the correct timing, maximising your health and fertility, and a little bit of technique. Here's a synopsis: Get the correct timing Maximise your health Technique My wife has given this plan (a more detailed version) to around 20 couples now and all have conceived within 6 months."
How can I tell if my toddler is truly gifted or just bright?,"It's most likely too early to tell.  If you could tell, it would depend greatly on how she is learning the things she knows.  Children's brains at that age have an extraordinary capacity for repeating things they observe, but mere remembering and repetition doesn't mean true understanding is happening. For example, if she is learning to read new words from you repeatedly pointing to the words while speaking them, then she says them, and after a while she remembers them, that's not a sign of giftedness.  If she is learning new words without you training her on them, just being read to, it might be. Repeating the trained sums of 1+1 and 2+1 isn't a sign of giftedness.  If she infers from those facts what the sum of 3+1 is, it might be. In other words, you need to determine whether you have been training her, or whether she is directing her own learning and coming to her own conclusions.  Most people consider it near impossible to determine at all until school age, with many educators arguing it's still too difficult until around age 8. However, I would caution you against this idea that a ""merely"" bright child wouldn't need special consideration regarding her education.  Modern school systems tend to treat children very homogeneously, and I think all children can benefit from individualized consideration.  Without it, whatever head start you have given her at home is likely to be completely erased within a couple years. Even children of average intelligence can excel by being given the same sorts of opportunities normally reserved for gifted programs, such as autonomy in choosing topics of study they are passionate about, and being given the freedom and support to explore them.  Look at the Sudbury Valley School for an excellent example.  I've seen it in my own son, who is of average intelligence, but he was so stifled and bored at school that he literally cried the last couple hours most days.  He is now thriving in his learning at home.  "
Convince my wife that the flu vaccine is good for our child,"It's possible your wife is mixing the Hygiene Hypothesis with vaccinations.  They're unrelated; the Hygiene Hypothesis is related specifically to children getting a particular virus (RSV) before they are exposed to various bacteria that train their immune system to respond a certain way to a particular immune ""switch"".  Vaccinations are unrelated to that. If your wife is concerned with general immunity, as in immunity to things other than the flu, she shouldn't worry; the influenza vaccine preps your body for influenza, but does not affect immunity to other pathogens (for better or worse). And beyond that, the influenza vaccine is not aimed at all influenza strains - just the 4 or so most deadly, or at least the ones that year the CDC/etc. think are most dangerous.  The ""general"" immune stimulation will be present one way or the other; plenty of other pathogens will be there, unless your child lives in a bubble. The flu vaccine, moreover, is not primarily to protect your child.  The flu vaccine is to protect society - and is particularly important in children because they are very effective spreaders of influenza.  It's protecting your child's parents, your child's teachers, your child's grandparents - in addition to protecting your child. It's not unreasonable to think that immunity from a vaccine and immunity from a pathogen might be different, and might have different impacts on future immunity.  Immune memory develops in many different ways with many different stimuli, and cross-linkage in particular can make a big difference in the duration of immune memory. Fortunately, there was a study of exactly this; they found that people who had yearly flu vaccines were more resistant to influenza than people who did not. Further, even if the ""wild"" immune reaction were better than the vaccine at producing immunity to future influenza infections, that comes at a significant cost.  A child who has influenza will lose several days of school, will lose weight, will spend days or weeks fighting off influenza instead of growing - see this article on growth failure from repeated infection for an extreme example."
How to deal with a teenager who wants his parents to buy him everything his friends have?,"It is never too late to teach your kid where money comes from and what it is worth. Since he is a student, his opportunities to earn will be somewhat restricted. Here is what I would do  I would tell him that I don't want to have to evaluate individual requests like ""Can I have a car?"" or ""Can I have $100 to go out for the evening?"" Instead I want to establish a budget, and give him that to spend as he sees fit. (This would be easier if his allowance in the past had been a fixed amount that he had to work out how to get what he wanted with, rather than something you can always ask for more of, but what's past is past.) He will not want to make a budget; it's hard work. So you and your wife have to agree that he gets no more money until there is a budget, and you will sit with him to do one if need be. Make sure the budget is generous and complete. Rent, tuition, books, a transit pass, groceries, clothes, mobile phone, internet, trips home to visit you from the university city, ... make sure that you cover everything he might spend money on, even going out drinking.  Either pay his tuition and rent directly, or have a way to know they have been paid, such as knowing the password for his online banking so you can check. I wouldn't normally recommend that for grown children (I don't do it for mine), but I think in your case a little verification is important. Give him the money he needs each month, or perhaps every two weeks. Check in with him regularly: ""is the budget enough? Are you able to get everything you need?"" but do not comment on what he is or isn't spending. If he wants to buy clothes with this month's money and there won't be money for restaurants, or he wants to live in the clothes he has and go out drinking a lot, let him make those choices and learn how to use a limited pool of money to try to get all he needs. He should feel that you care, and want him to be looked after, but not that you are a ""walking wallet"" or his own personal ATM. If he comes back and says the budget isn't enough, that he budgeted X a month for restaurants and has spent 3X already this week, here is where it gets hard. You have to tell him that the budget is fixed, he had a chance when making it with you to accurately estimate restaurant use, and now he will just have to economize elsewhere. Expect pushback. But it's much easier to discuss ""raising a budget from A a month to B a month"" than ""giving you a car."" Don't hesitate to say ""we can't afford that"" if it is the truth. Children often think their families are rich (not knowing about the costs of mortages, insurance, new furnaces, taxes etc), but if we can't afford something we can't afford it and that's that. Also, try to help him observe the world more accurately, using the tradeoff information he is learning about his own budget. With a little perspective your son may realize that he wants everything all his friends have, but none of his friends actually have everything all his friends have. The same thing happens for adults with Facebook updates: one friend is on an amazing vacation, one is at a swim meet or something where their kid is getting medals, one just got promoted, one made a beautiful pie, one lost 50 pounds, one learned another language - but nobody did all those things and you can't measure yourself against that aggregate. (If you have the right kind of Facebook feed, show him that to make the point.) Chances are you can't have this part of the conversation until your child has been trying to live with the budget for a while and making some of the tradeoffs. And of course it will be torpedoed if he has a millionaire friend who does in fact do all of those things. Let's hope that's not the case for your child. Look into the recent past to see if you sometimes ""cry wolf."" Have you or your wife said no, even said something was impossible and couldn't be done, and then in the end done it? If so, you will have trained him to be persistent and keep going until you change your mind. You will need to address this with him directly. ""I know, usually your mother will eventually give you what you want, but we are at the absolute ceiling of what we can spend on you, there is no more."" And then for heaven's sake, stick to it. You aren't doing him any favours teaching him there are no limits and whining and sulking will always get you what you want. Give him the tools he needs to be good with money. It's part of making a grownup."
Is baby talk helpful or detrimental?,"Baby talk, when used correctly is beneficial to speech development. For infants not yet using speech at all, use exaggerated changes in pitch and tone to help them learn the rhythm of speech and the difference between tones of voice.  Make games of mimicking different sounds for one another (this helps your child learn phonemes in the language(s) spoken at home). For little ones just beginning to string together syllables, you don't need the sing-song voice used with infants, but you should still over-emphasize changes in tone so they can easily catch on.  Meanwhile, don't use made-up words, but do vary your pitch -- remember, until your child starts to consistently use words to represent things or actions, he/she hasn't grasped what words are, and needs whatever you can do to make them interesting. Once your child routinely uses words to influence their world (""more"", ""drink"", ""cookie"", ""please"", ""ride"", ""no""), it's time to speak in normal tones.  Now words have intrinsic value to your child, and there's no need for games. Don't use made-up words or broken grammar at any point in your child's speech development ... if he/she is going to go to the effort of learning something, it may as well be useful rather than something to be later un-learned. Do correct errors when they crop up, don't let them become habit. Baby talk often becomes a problem because parents use made-up words, don't phase it out when the child begins to develop speech ability, or think that the errors in pronunciation, enunciation, or grammar their children make are cute and do not correct them."
Do I enforce a punishment/retribution promised some time ago?,"There are a lot of unanswered questions in my mind. Where were the parents during the visit? Do they agree with your desire to have authority over the child? Will they be there for this visit? Will there be fallout over your decision? And finally, was the scenario - a 7-year-old sharing toys with a 2-year-old - necessary? (I would think a lot of the 7-year-old's toys were not interesting or relevant to the 2-year-old.) Without the answers to the above questions, I'll venture to answer your question.  I believe it is very important if you are in a position of authority to avoid making empty threats. Empty threats undermine authority greatly. My children knew that whatever consequence I warned them would result from continued bad behavior was going to happen 100% of the time. This made them consider their actions carefully. It also, however, placed a heavy burden on me to be careful and considerate with my words, to look for alternative ways, if possible, to deal with their bad behaviors, and to make the punishment fit the crime (to be a natural consequence of the bad behavior, or to make it commensurate with the behavior.) For this reason, I would leave the bouncy castle out of play for the entire visit, including to your own 2-year-old. Surely a 2-year-old can be distracted from a bouncy castle for a few days. As to two wrongs not making a right, this is where wisdom comes in before you issue an ultimatum. What's done is done. If you really believe you were wrong and should not have issued that threat, then apologies are in order. If you don't believe you were wrong, then no bouncy castle. Your daughter will not only witness his consequential bad behavior, but might also be old enough to understand that you did not fulfill a promise you made in defending her against his bad behavior. Depends where exactly she is in her third year of life. This is your house and your daughter. You have to weigh the whole of the situation in your decision. One thing I will say, though, is that 7 years of age is not too early for a consequence three weeks (or more) into the future. Edited to add: In response to a comment (why bother if the parents don't agree?), I would say that in your home, you set the (reasonable) rules, and the guests (reasonably) comply. That's how it works in healthy relationships. In dysfunctional relationships, there are usually issues with boundaries, namely that people don't understand them or don't respect them. It doesn't mean that the errant children will not learn something valuable.* A reasonable boundary is ""In my home, we share toys - where appropriate - even with 2-year-olds."" A reasonable counter-boundary is ""You do not have the authority to discipline our child in our presence."" Those need to be worked out; if the parents don't enforce your wishes themselves, something uncomfortable needs to be done (e.g. you remove yourselves from the situation, or you have a confrontation). *One year, my family and my brother-in-law's family decided to take a one-week vacation to Disneyworld together because we had children very close in age, and they got along very well. However, on the first day, my children were constantly being corrected for behavior that was not inappropriate (the in-laws kids were all quiet, submissive girls; I had rowdy, loudish children.) For example, they were told to be quiet in public places when they weren't being loud, etc. My kids were constantly being told what not to do, and my kids (and I) were frustrated. On the second day, they were peering at something through a fence. The brother-in-law yelled, ""Get away from that fence!"" There was absolutely no reason for them not to look through the fence; the fence was there to prevent people from entering a pond. I said to my BIL, ""J---, please don't correct our children when we are right here. If you're concerned, please tell us, and we'll deal with it however we think best."" His response was, ""That's ridiculous! If I can't discipline your kids at all times, we can't go on vacation together!"" My response was, ""Your choice. Let us know what you decide."" We parted ways to another part of the park. After about 36 hours apart, my BIL apologized and agreed to respect my boundary. The rest of the vacation was much more relaxing, and a really fun vacation that we all remember fondly, as were subsequent vacations together."
What should I be teaching my two year old?,"These are the things that the Montessori school our son attends looks for; note that these are not things you'd expect a two-year old to already be fully competent in, more that these are a good sample of the items that they measure in their report card: Other things that he's learned that they don't explicitly focus on: It sounds like you're focusing a lot on the first set of explicit teaching directives (ie, knowing the basics of language, colors, etc), but not necessarily giving her access to other kids to learn how to socialize with equals and how to function in the classroom.  Is that important?  I don't know; I do suspect that going to preschool for a few hours a week will help ease her into kindergarten and beyond, but it may be that your daughter is particularly adaptable to new situations and the change won't be so dramatic for her."
Breaking my rejection of christianity to my parents,"I can almost agree with Torben's answer, but I think his conclusion is a little too gentle to the point of placing an additional burden on you. DVK's comments have the right attitude, but are a bit too passive for what you're describing. When the topic comes up, I recommend calmly explaining exactly what you believe and don't believe. I don't think dancing around the issue is going to help you at all. Use common sense, be polite and respectful, and don't feel the need to get into a theological debate, but don't censor your beliefs, lie by omission, or hide your thoughts to preserve the relationship.  As disturbing and sad as it may be, if your parents would reject you for this, you already don't have a good relationship, just the illusion of one based on an arbitrary condition.  Be strong enough to face the fact that this may not end well and bring up the topic. Others have indicated that merely expressing your disbelief is somehow disrespectful and I encourage you to reject that notion completely. One last tip on implementation: Be positive! Instead of saying you reject Christianity, why not explain to your parents what you actually believe now? For example, if asked about a church, explain that you've become a humanist (e.g.) and have begun exploring that through meetings/books/study/etc.."
How should I talk to my child about death?,"Great question. I can't answer what you should tell your child, as that is largely dependent on your beliefs, but can try and give you some pointers on how you could talk to your child. Whatever it is you belief, we found it helped us to talk to our son (5 at the time) in as simple and direct terms possible, and to not be overly emotional ourselves. Of course you want to be warm, empathic and comforting, and can share (and show) that you're sad, but we tried to stay as level as possible. We also tried to emphasize that it is simply a part of life: everything is born (or made), has a certain lifespan, and then dies (or breaks). We drew parallels to animals, plants, toys, cars etc. Then we tried to give some thought to the good times we shared, and that we should be thankful for the time we had with the person, and try to hold on to those good memories in our sadness. Finally, we acknowledged that it was not fair (the death was somewhat premature) and that it was ok to be angry about it - but that that wouldn't change the fact that the person was gone and that we shouldn't let that taint our memories of the person. Add to this whatever beliefs you hold about life and death that you wish to share (side note: my wife and I belief different things, so we explained this to our son and explained both our beliefs - he decided he liked my wife's better and is sticking with that for now). The above is what we thought of as age appropriate for our son, and I would simplify for younger children. Hope that helps! "
What are some options for helping my child continue learning while schools are closed?,"Khan Academy is a great resource for letting children learn math and science/technology at any age.  It allows children to progress through different subjects, includes videos to teach them each subject and then offers practice questions to help them master subjects. I in particular use the ""MAP Recommended Practice"" feature with my son, who is a fairly advanced math student.  You can enter their test scores in, and based on those test scores it recommends the next lessons for them to take to ensure appropriate subject matter and difficulty. I have been offering my children 2 hours of Khan Academy per day, plus 1 hour of reading, 1 hour of practice programming (using Scratch or Python), and 1 hour of more gamified learning (such as Prodigy, which is basically Pokémon but with math problems needing to be solved in order to do damage to your opponent!).  I intersperse an hour of video gaming time and an hour of playing either outside or around the house (but mobile, not sitting time) in order to keep them active. "
5yrs old being bossy... Is this too much or tolerable at this age?,"I don't think you're in a black or white situation, where this 'bossy' behavior is either normal, or a problem that needs a parental solution-- It's both.  It is quite normal for some five year olds to be bossy, attempt to control others, and to sometimes take it too far and be a bit of a bully to others, particularly if they are very confident kids with shyer playmates.  It is also a type of behavior that often calls for some parental guidance (not necessarily punishment).  I definitely don't endorse 'double punishing' any behavior that already got a consequence at school. Continuing to talk to your daughter about sharing and asking/speaking nicely to others, and asking her to consider how her words make others feel is more appropriate and will probably more effective, in my opinion, than a punishment for something that happened previously.  If it's mostly a matter of your daughter's strong opinions/bossiness upsetting A in this one instance, and not a situation where she's specifically targeting a particular classmate, I feel like a calm, non-punitive talk about relating kindly to others is plenty of intervention. It sounds like you're already working on it, and that's all you really need to tell A's parents."
"My wife wants a 4th baby, but I don't","You're only 25 years old, your oldest hasn't even started school yet, your youngest is 9 months old, and you want another? Wow, your wife is in a hurry. My immediate impression is that your wife is living in a dream world, striving toward some fantasy that she perhaps hasn't shared with you yet. You definitely need to talk more - and go deeper in those talks.  You are not required to agree but I strongly advise to keep drilling, keep talking until you feel you understand her point of view. Only when you understand her point of view can you begin to present your opinion, because only then can you frame your arguments to match her world. ""Seek first to understand, then to be understood,"" as Stephen Covey would say. Bottom line: You two need to make a decision together or it will tear you apart. It's going to be frustrating but try to keep an open mind and do your best to continue a constructive discussion until you reach an agreement. Seek assistance via counseling if you have to. This is important because if you're not both in absolute agreement, this can cause big problems years from now. One additional thought: How does she determine when you've got enough kids? What's to stop her from using the same arguments for a fifth child? And how would you answer the same questions?"
Why are parents so concerned about profanity around their children?,"Because children in that age range are learning language skills rapidly, and primarily by listening to what adults say.   If they hear a new word, they will almost certainly try to use that word, even if they do not understand what the word means (which is frequently the case).  It is how they learn.   Obviously you aren't offended by profanity, but believe it or not, many people are.  It is, after all, intended to be... well... profane. Using profanity in school can cause problems for both children and their parents.  Once they start using profanity, it becomes difficult to get them to stop, as most attempts only teach the child that there is something ""special"" about those words, and that those words are more likely to get some sort of response, whether positive or negative."
"Should endless ""but what if"" questions be encouraged or discouraged?","In my opinion (as a parent, not a psychologist or educator), curiosity is not something that should ever be discouraged... except that everything has limits rooted in practicality.  What the child is doing with the ""what if"" cycle is to explore the topic and all of the edges.  What if... really means ""tell me more about this"", and it's something that seems to be helping with strategic thinking from what I've seen in my children. That said, as you say it will go on literally indefinitely.  What I usually do is try to continue the line of reasoning for a while, but if it does seem like it's in ""indefinite"" territory, I try to zoom out a bit.  Oftentimes part of why the ""what if"" cycle happens is the child isn't able to quite frame their thought correctly - so they keep readjusting until they get to what they really want.  Zooming out is useful because it gives them more ""big picture"" context and lets them explore the answer themselves. The other thing I'll often do is redirect them to answering the ""what if"" themselves.  ""Great question.  What do you think would happen?""  This does two things - it stops the what if train for the moment, and it lets the child develop their own reasoning skills further rather than just asking questions.  I might ask the question in a bit more detail than just 'what do you think', depending on the age the child is and the information the question requires; but often it can be as simple as that.  Then when the child gives an answer, if it's incorrect or missing information you can add some additional clarifying information as part of the followup."
I seem to have good talks with my 16 yr old son about his life but then he is texting his friend trashing me?,"Ahhhh...TEENS!!! The true test of parenting. Don't you wish he were a ""terrible two"" again or a ""terrifying Three"".  My boys are now 20 & 18.  My daughter just turned 16 and here is what I have learned and a great quote from my own mother... ""If they like you all the time, then you're doing your job wrong.""  Here is the first thing you need to do. STOP. Take a step back, breathe and get your bearings. You do no one any good if you fall apart. Do you remember being 16? This is his journey and you can set rules, guidelines and enforce them but I'm going to tell you this, when he isn't in your home, you have zero control. He's going to fall on his face, make mistakes and make a mess. You are now reaching the parenting point where you can only pray a lot and be there when he falls. We all have this idea that our child will be different, our child will be so loved and provided for that they won't make mistakes, they won't be ""that kid"", they wont cave in to peer pressure...but the fact is that's not how it works. Its time for you to transition from the parent that is still teaching all the time to the parent that starts to trust what he has already taught. Have faith. Don't put yourself in a position where you are pushing him away because one day he'll be in a situation at 3am and you want to be the one he can call, not the one he avoids. It's a hard balance. Research it, talk to other parents, get different ideas.  But what ever you do, don't turn every encounter into a lecture and don't think that just because he had a ""heart to heart"" with you one day, doesn't mean he's not right back to mischief the next moment. He's 16...the frontal lobe of his brain (which controls impulse and reasoning) hasn't fully developed yet...and won't till he is 28!!!  So hang in there and never, ever give up. Some day he'll be 30 and thank you!!"
My 5 year- old daughter is constantly defiant!,"Around the age of 4 to 6, all children develop a sense of self and self-efficacy. From the perspective of the parents, children that were easy to direct before now become contrary. At the same time a child that age cannot express her frustrations well without resorting to tears or, if the frustration is bad, a tantrum. Around the age of 6 or 7, children develop the ability to understand and care about another person's wishes and needs. Then the ""unwarranted"" and extreme outbursts stop. (All of this is a process and not something that happens over night, so of course your child's behavior will slowly get ""better"" in the coming months.) So, first of all don't expect your child to be able to suppress her frustration and discuss her wants with you like an adult would. The tantrum is okay, it is her way of saying: I really don't want this. Just as you expect other people to accept that you don't agree with them, accept that your child does not agree with you. She just cannot express it in a civilized manner. Second, following from your understanding that your child's behavior is totally normal and in tune with her current developmental abilities, there is no need to get upset about your child's emotional outburst. Distance yourself from it. It is not you, who is frustrated and gets upset, but your child. Just as you would be expected to deal with an adult saying that he does not like what you want of him and feels sad or angered, you must be able to accept that your child is of a different opinion. Disagreement is something that both parties have to endure. Stay calm and relaxed. After some time you will realize that your child's tantrums get weaker and less frequent, because, third, a child is a very adaptable being. Children can grow up under all kinds of circumstances, and still be healthy and ""function well"". This means, if you turn it around, that much of what you observe in your child is adaptation to her surroundings, and since you are a prominent part of those surroundings, much of that behavior is, in other words, caused by you. If you change yourself, your child will adapt to those changes and in turn be changed as well. Understanding and friendly parents are proven to be the most reliable cause of nice children :-) Finally, if your child is extremely frustrated by what life and you throw at her, think about if what you expect of her is maybe not really fair. For example, I would say that taking away her toys is just not right. They don't belong to you, and you have no right to take them away. Just imagine your husband would take away all your clothes (or whatever) because you were not in the mood to cook (or whatever). Why do you treat your child in a way that you would never accept if it were done with you? Expecting her to hold eye contact when you tell her not to express her frustration is degrading. Imagine you must do something, that you really, really find unfair, and you express your anger, and the person ordering you expects you to look him in they eyes and tell them that you will do it and not say anything unfriendly henceforth. How would you feel? I would feel like I want to punch that person in the face. And that is what your daughter does. Again, it comes down to accepting that some things are frustrating to your daughter and that it is perfectly okay that she lets you know of this frustration. After all, your family is not a tyranny, but a family, isn't it? It is based on love and understanding, not on your child performing your wishes without any mind of her own. I have found that a good strategy in dealing with children is threefold: Enforce your own boundaries, not those of the child. For example, if you want quiet after eight o'clock, enforce that quiet. Don't force your child into bed. My son -- he is now five -- started going to bed without any problems, after I made clear to him that I won't bend a finger for him after eight. He had to go to bed without me reading to him and tucking him in a few nights, and now he gets ready when I tell him he has half an hour, if he wants me to read a story to him. Of course he cannot fall asleep immediately every night, because some nights he is not tired, some nights there are things that he needs to think about, and some nights he simply wants to look at another book or play with his cars some more. I allow him all of that, but I suggest to him that he do it in bed and turn off the light when he is finished. So some nights he reads a book and some nights he quietly plays with some toys, but I get my quiet and I don't have to do anything for him, and he accepts that. I do the same things with all other things that once were a cause for fighting: getting dressed for kindergarten (he once had to go without shoes in the snow, and he was never dressed late after that), eating what he filled on his plate (he does not get anything else to eat before he eats everything on his plate, no matter how long this may take, even if he has to eat the cold lunch for breakfast the next day (yes, I don't warm it up anymore)) etc. My son, who is extremely strong willed and threw lots of tantrums when he was four, is a nice and easy child today, only because I stopped telling him what to do. The only thing I tell him is what I will do or not do. And he accepts that. Remain calm and unaffected. If you don't get upset or angry or sad or whatever by the tantrums, the child will understand that they have no effect and stop throwing them. And with unaffected I don't mean simply outwardly cool, but truly unaffected. Children know if they affect you, and they will use it (which is the only power they have, so don't begrudge them it). Your child must have the impression that whatever is happening must happen, because it is a law of nature. It has to go to bed in the same way that the sun has to sink under the horizon. It is not you who want that, it is something that simply happens. Act that way. You would not get upset about the sun, so don't get upset about your child. Make things happen (sit down on the sofa and don't deal with your child, after you said what was going to happen -- if you do this a couple of time, the thing you want will happen). Be clear about what you want. I don't mean, express yourself in a way that your child understands you, but: You yourself must understand what you truly want. Do you want that your child goes to bed at eight, or do you want quiet and time for yourself? That is not the same, and you can have a quiet time for yourself even if your child is still awake. There really is no reason why a child must sleep at eight. If she sleeps late she will be tired the next day, and that is none of your concern, because she will be in a foul mood, not you. If you explain the effects that she experiences to her, after some time she will understand and want to go to bed early. It is said that you have to repeat things 200 times, before a child learns them, so don't expect one explanation to be enough. Your child is growing up, so give her time to learn. One final word of warning: Spanking (which is forbidden in many western countries and could lead a parent to jail in Germany) has been consistently shown to be linked to mood disorders, anxiety disorders, substance abuse and personality disorders. I would strongly recommend that you stop spanking your child immediately."
Daughter is 11 and really upset that she may be lesbian,"Simple answer - these feelings are normal and not necessarily an indication of her sexuality, just a child's confusion and anxiety over physical intimacy.  There is nothing to be concerned about, nothing special you or your daughter needs to do.   Just let time reveal her sexuality.  When it happens, she'll know it and if she believes that there's nothing wrong with whatever choice she makes, she'll be better prepared to handle it."
How to teach a child to swallow pills?,"Try a two-pronged approach: Teach proper technique. Many of us were taught to tilt the face upward when swallowing, but recent research see here shows, that this actually makes it harder to swallow. The suggestion is to either a) put the pill on the tongue, then suck a big gulp of water from a plastic bottle or b) put the pill on the tongue, take some water into the mouth, then tilt the head down when swallowing. The link above also gives detailed instructions with pictures. Let them practice. A small peace of candy (mimicking size and shape of the pills, e.g a TicTac, better not too sticky) could be the dummy for test runs. Doesn't leave a bad taste when the first attempts don't work. So when necessary, the kids know what to do. Just remember to remind them (again, I suppose) that real medicine is not candy and while the candy may take the place of a pill for this exercise, it's never, never the other way round."
How to help a toddler overcome the fear of water on head?,"We had exactly the same situation with our daughter, until very recently (she is three years old now). The best recommendation I can give you is: We were always firm about washing her hair regularly, even though she protested quite strongly. On the other hand, we always told her before, that we would wash her hair today (like, at noon, when we usually bathe her shortly before night-time, and repeatedly during the afternoon). That did not make her like it any more, but I believe that it is important to be honest to your child in those things.
When it was time to wash her hair, we informed her again of what was about to happen, and addressed her protests (""I know you don't like it, but it has to be done, I'm sorry sweety"") instead of ignoring them. I believe that this is important, because we want our child to know that we listen to her, so that she can confide in us.  It went like this for almost two years, and suddenly, about 6 weeks ago, she started rinsing her hair herself. Miracles do happen... ;-) Anyway, it your daughter's reaction does not necessarily have to be caused by something you did earlier, maybe she just doesn't like it, period. Don't beat yourself up because of this, thinking that you are bad parents, because you aren't!"
To what extent should an (almost) two year old be able to lie still on command?,"I am a physician, starting as a Family Practitioner and switching to Emergency Medicine. I can safely say that over the decades, I've examined and done procedures of some kind, including suturing lacerations, removing foreign objects from ear canals and other invasive and unpleasant things on thousands of children ranging from infants to... lets limit it to 10 year olds. Having said that, I'll limit this to my experience with 2 year olds, so hundreds. You (and others) will most likely not like my answer. Would it normally be expected for a (almost exactly) two year old to be able to lie still for several minutes on command, even in an unfamiliar situation such as being covered in electrodes in a doctor's office? In my experience, yes, a 2 year old should be - and (vastly) most commonly is - able to lie still for an invasive or semi-invasive procedure for a stranger in the presence of one or both parents, including ECGs (which don't hurt). If the parents act respectfully towards the physician in the presence of the child, the child most commonly understands there is an unspoken transfer of authority to the doctor, and having no experience with this adult, do not try to ""test boundaries""; IOW, they tend to unquestioningly obey the physician. Kids of different ages have differing fears and ability to control themselves based on their ability to anticipate discomfort. I would expect a 2 year old to be wary of strangers, but acquiescent in the presence of a calm, encouraging and supportive parent. Having said that, it sounds like your physician did not have a bedside manner very  suitable for your child. It's much, much easier to have a cooperative patient if the child is approached with patience and respect. Once a child is afraid of the physician and has lost trust in them, it's very much an uphill battle. One I have very rarely fought (thankfully.) If it is expected, what techniques could we use to help our daughter to learn to do this at her age? It's not your job to teach your 2 year old how to behave during a procedure. It's the doctor's job - or the technician's - to know how to put apprehensive patients at relative ease and gain their cooperation. Sure, if you had electrodes at home to play with ahead of time, it could be helpful, but pulling the electrodes off improperly could be uncomfortable enough to make it more difficult, not less, for the person doing the real EKG. So I would not recommend it. Gaining their trust takes time, and unfortunately, doctors have less and less time to spend with patients every year. This is clearly suboptimal for both the doctor and the patient. So, your doctor made one correct statement and one I would consider incorrect. Furthermore, they were inappropriate in their failure to control their frustration and lashing out. I'm not a pediatrician, but as a family doc, I learned lots of tricks for dealing with kids from my teachers in med school and residency, and added my own to my repertoire. In this case, I would have started by showing the child an electrode and letting them handle it. (""See? It's only  plastic, and it's a little bit cold. But we can warm them up like this, see?"") I would have reassured them that it doesn't hurt, would have applied one to the parent's arm and asked the parent if it hurt. If that wasn't enough (it usually was), I would ask the child if they would let me do it if we did it to their parent at the same time. That's usually acceptable. If not, I would offer to do it to myself at the same time, or before (to show them what it involves.)  Sometimes silliness works. Seriously, I've never had to go further than this, but for painful procedures, I would resort to bribery: stickers, ice cream, or whatever floated their little boats (asking the parent, of course). If a child had to be held down against their will (which of course doesn't allow for an accurate ECG), I would have considered it a failure on my part, unless and only unless the parent was inappropriate and frightened the child themselves, which, believe it or not, happens."
How do you support/cope with your 15yr old daughter wanting to become a boy?,"I am not a parent going through this, but I've been that child, so I have a few suggestions. The most important thing is to take her seriously. You can express this in various ways. The first is to really try to understand her situation. She's not gay, she's having trouble with her psychological gender idendity vs her physical sex. Do some research on the terminologies and what they mean, so you can use the right words and better understand what she's going through. You seem accepting and as supportive as you can, but the more you know, the better you can help her. Accomodate her as much as you can. So what if she wants to wear guy clothes? If that makes her feel more comfortable in her own skin, and therefore helping her in a time when she's already struggling and unbalanced, go for it.  Seek professional help. It is too early for surgery, especially since I get the feeling she might just be in the process of figuring out where on the gender scale she actually is, and 15 is probably too late to push back puberty and buy more time, but there might be other ways to help her. But only a professional can really figure out what might be appropriate in her case. More importantly, they can help her on the journey of looking inside, finding out who she really is. Currently she's probably rebelling against the ouside world which says she's a girl, when that doesn't feel 'right'. With patience and guidance she might be abble to accept that dichtonomy, but for that to happen, understanding is key, as well as being accepted fully and without reservations, whichever way she decides in the end.  Whether in the end she accepts her current sex or takes the plunge, it will be a long and often painful process, and I whish you and your daughter all the best."
"Can a punishment be devoid of any ""violence""?","No, punishment is violence. Violence, a fact of life, is a part of nature and their world. The question implicit is what are the tolerable/intolerable externalities of violence and how to manage the potential risks that you fear in accomplishing the desired behavior modification in the child. However, please do reconsider whether you must resort to punishment/violence at all or if you can think of more preemptive ways, prior to the child enacting the behavior, without hurting feelings and wasting energy (which can have long term lasting undesired impacts.) You must lead by example. And show that it works. And, very importantly, not confuse matters by associating the desired or undesired behavior with interpersonal physical, emotional, or economic return. If you associate the behavior with physical punishment, the child will associate the behavior with punishment when you are present. It will become a game of cat & mouse in which the child will either try to circumvent punishment or do the behavior when you're not around. OR, worse, the child may compare such behavior as equivalent to other types of behavior from their peers and seek to punish them. If you associate the behavior with emotional punishment, then the child will hone more subtle & sophisticated ways of circumventing and manipulating your emotions in relation to the behavior. They will then apply those same emotional tricks to other people in life in getting what they want only to fool themselves about interpersonal relations when they've broken enough trust or thought they could change others to ""have it all."" If you associate the behavior with compensation, then they will come up with a pricing/blackmailing system in which they behave in certain ways depending on degrees of payment. If you take something away, then they may try to take something away from you, for example, peace and quiet. If the child gets accustomed to punishment, then they will identify punishment as a normal part of their everyday existence; the cost of just simply living, so to speak. They may even get used to their actions and regular dose of expected punishment and believe that such a plight is a part of their life story. 'I do this because that's just me. So it's okay.' 'I get punished because that's what I'm about.' Then, you have a potential repeat-offending future criminal that you're raising because, through repeated exposure, their sense of risk has been desensitized. So, WATCH OUT! How you treat them can turn on you. I heard a Native American once say that, in his culture, parents understood that, one day, the small child will be big and the big parent will be small. Children learn through observation and witnessing the benefit of your example. And, by personal association/identification, they must personalize the values you wish to cultivate inside of them. This does not preclude you from expressing yourself and also demonstrating how to deal with other adults who see the world differently and play by different rules. But, remember, how they observe you teaches them what are the most effective ways of living through life."
Is putting a 9-year-old to bed early abusive?,"I was a foster parent for a year.  I met parents who were unequivocally abusive.  One thing I took from that experience is that the term ""abusive"" is applied way too frequently to normal parents who at worst are making honest mistakes and at best just have a different parenting style.  It dilutes the impact of the word, and in my opinion dishonors truly abused children.  That label should never be applied to parents who are honestly and kindly trying to do what's right for the health of their child. That being said, even if it doesn't rise to the level of abuse, it's possible such an early bedtime may be a mistake.  You didn't mention how the topic came up with the teacher in the first place, or what your daughter's daily agenda is like.  If she effectively has no awake time at home, it might be worth sacrificing an hour or two of sleep in order not to deprive her of those learning and social opportunities. One thing is that kids don't usually need their wind down time to be in bed.  You can just have a ""settle down"" hour where only quiet and still activities are allowed.  Don't assume it will still take an hour to wind down if you put her to bed later.  It might take a while to adjust to the new routine, but assuming no medical problems, kids generally will fall asleep within 5-10 minutes when their bodies are ready to sleep."
"My mom dislikes my hairstyle, is this normal?","I don't agree with Joe, when he says it is the job of parents to set boundaries; it is too narrow. Good parents strive to equip their children with good life-skills that help them make the good choices, which will make them happy. I'm a grandparent BTW, so I've perhaps learned a broader perspective, now that my own children have grown up, largely ignoring my well-intentioned advice. Teaching children to respect boundaries is only a minor part of what you need in adult life; it is important, but like you, I can't see that you hair-style matters much - just look at succesful people around the world. They come in weird and wonderful varieties - what makes them successful is clearly not the hair. So why does your mum insist on this? My guess is that it is about fitting in: many people are anxious about standing out in society and giving the wrong impression - and on the other side of this, there are the immature leader-types, who have a desire to dominate, but lack the broad perspective, and dare one say it: wisdom, that comes with experience, so they focus on petty issues like how you look or what they call 'good manners'. So what can you do? Perhaps the easiest is what you seem to suggest: shrug your shoulders for now and do what you have to do to avoid the arguments. Or you can fight back, if you feel it is too much. Both may give you valuable life skills; 'grin and bear it' can make you tolerant and good with other people, 'fighting your corner' could give you the skills and independence of a leader."
What are some tips for making an international flight with a toddler?,"Buy a bunch of cheaps toy that the child has never played with. Bring something like a travel etch-a-sketch or some craft things that can be played repeatedly Ensure he has his midday nap, this usually knocks 2 - 3 hours off. Try and find other young children on the plane that they can talk to. This works like a miracle. Portable DVD player if there is no in-flight entertainment. Plenty of snacks. We bring instant noodles as this is not junk food and takes my son at long time to eat. Regular (once every 30 minutes) take them for a walk. This is limited in where you can go, but it helps a lot I found. You can take them to bathroom once an hour and every half an hour just take them for a loop either forward or backward through the kitchenette. The flight staff don't mind as long as you are not going into a different class section of the plane."
"Baby fights to get out of arms, cries when I put him down","Babies are not good at figuring out what is bothering them -- simply that something is. Being tired, in particular, leads to a general crankiness that is difficult to alleviate. Since your son doesn't really understand that simply falling asleep will help him feel better if he's tired, he starts ""complaining"" in general. I am unhappy. It must be the way I'm being held. {struggle} But once he does get away, he's still dealing with that previous discomfort and now he's lost a source of comfort. So he'll cry more: Wait, this is worse. I am even more unhappy! Hold me! (Repeat that cycle until the parent is also exhausted and cranky.) You can try shifting positions, rocking/bouncing, having a different adult hold him for a while, let him lie down while you rub his back or stomach (so you're still present and soothing)... but those may or may not be effective. Unfortunately, nothing beyond falling asleep for a while will ultimately make him happy. And see this related question as well: Why do babies fight sleep and how to calm them down?"
How can I deal with stealing at school (by other kids)?,"I'm sorry for what you're going through; bullying is terribly distressing and something that can make you feel really helpless as a parent. Helpless, because it's an acute problem with no quick fixes. I think, however, there are several things you can and should do in this situation. In communicating with your child
Your top priority is to reinforce your child's sense of self worth. In bullying, there's a real risk that the child will internalize the bullying, and come to the conclusion that they are somehow wrong, or that they somehow deserve how they're being treated. You need to see your child, validate their feelings, and make sure they always realize that what they've experienced was wrong, and that they're entitled to expect fair treatment from others. I strongly recommend against advocating for fighting back, as you hint at. This will risk undermining my prior more important point. It will skew your kids value system towards violence and bullying, and it will put your kid in harms way. Teach self defense, by all means. Retaliation, absolutely not. Acknowledge that ending the bullying is ultimately out of your control. Working towards this is the responsibility of the school. Make sure your child doesn't get the impression this is something they should solve. There may be ways to avoid being targeted by the bully, but your child shouldn't own the problem of correcting the bully. In communicating with the school
The school needs to fix this. Be relentless. Do  not accept that this is out of their hands. Keeping your children safe while they're in their care is their absolute top priority, trumping any educational objectives. Make sure they're on top of this, and make sure they're putting blame where it is due; that they don't try to shift responsibility towards adapting your child's behaviour, as may be appealing when dealing with the bully is a lot more difficult for them as well. Teachers who aren't taking this seriously cannot be accepted. ""Tried to find him but couldn't"" absolutely will not do. Do accept, however, that the steps taken may not look exactly like what you may have had in mind. As a parent of the victim, it is easy to crave vengeance, but this is not their role, and this is not what you need. What you need is for the bullying to stop, and successful violence prevention may well focus more on working constructively with the bully than on exacting punishment. The balance you need to strike is making sure they're on top of this at all times, while at the same time staying cooperative and not making yourself a part of their problem. Keeping a log of incidents may be helpful in meetings with the school administration, to keep the discussion matter-of-factly. In communicating with the parents of the bully
Don't. (This section previously cautioned against some aspects of reaching out to the other parents, but it was argued in comments that the risks of this are always higher than the potential benefits, so simply avoiding it always is preferable. The entire discussion can be found in chat for those interested). "
What to do with many painted pictures/ handicraft work,"We take pictures or scan images to save digitally. We also have a set amount of space for saving artwork and crafts, a flat box about the size of a pizza box and a small shelf in her room. When those spaces get full, we weed some things out. I've found with my child that after she has had a little distance from her creations she is able to let go more easily; it's also easier to let go of a few items at a time instead of a big purge.  We think up ways together to reuse artwork that we can't save. We have used drawings and paintings as gift wrap or to make birthday or holiday cards. Sometimes we take apart a craft project to reuse materials for other projects. She cuts up old paintings to make new collages, some little clay figures went to live under different plants in the garden. Now that she is older, she makes a memory book at least once per year and she will put in a photo or a small piece of a larger painting along with her other mementos. "
"If a pregnant woman's tummy is pressed hard, can the baby in her womb get hurt?","It's fine to 'poke' the outside of the baby bump. In fact it's the first 'game' you can play with your little one. :) Is it okay to poke my pregnant belly? Sure… if that’s what you want to do. It might seem weird at first, since baby is so small and still developing. But your baby is incredibly well cushioned in there. Remember, she’s floating in a sac of amniotic fluid, which is surrounded by a thick, muscular organ (your uterus). On top of that is your skin and belly fat (more cushioning!). Of course, just because it won’t hurt baby, doesn’t mean she can’t feel you poking — in fact, baby will probably feel you move and poke before you can start to feel her, which is usually at around 18 to 20 weeks. And when baby’s big enough, she might even poke back! Kelly Kasper, MD, ob-gyn and associate clinical professor at the Indiana University School of Medicine, in ""Is It Safe To Poke My Belly?"" for The Bump A baby in the womb is quite well-protected, it takes a hard fall - the kind which injures mum - to injure the baby: In the first trimester, a thick, muscular uterus and an even more protective pelvic bone shield your baby, so it is nearly impossible to injure her if you trip and fall. By the fifth month, however, your uterus grows beyond the protective shell of your pelvic bone. While the chances of injury from a simple fall are still very unlikely, many pregnancy worries stem from these changes in your body. ... There is no need to worry unduly about minor falls. Your baby is well protected by the natural shock absorbers of your abdominal muscles, uterine muscles, fetal membranes and the amniotic fluid, all of which cushion any outside blows. It would take an accident that seriously injures mommy to have even a remote chance of injuring baby. Growing Concerns, Ask Dr Sears"
How to calm a toddler before bedtime?,"A bath worked really well for our toddlers (which didn't seem to for yours), but I think the bigger picture was a routine.  Our first daughter was very wild towards bedtime until we started making a routine and sticking to it. We followed the same steps every night at bedtime and after a couple of weeks when we started the routine each night, she would start to calm down.  We tried to start the routine at the same time every night as well. We also tried to get her to be physically active about an hour before we started the routine to wear her out a little bit. There is the obvious one of not giving them sugar too close to bedtime, or any food too close to bedtime for that matter. She still had her wild moments every once in a while, but having a structured, consistent routine helped us out immensely. Good luck!"
Is it reasonable/common for a daycare to show TV shows during the day?,"This sounds totally inappropriate and a major warning flag. Both my children have been through numerous childcare centres/kindergartens/ELCs and none of them even had a television. The American Academy of Pediatrics have ""that parents should limit the amount of time their infants and toddlers spend in front of any sort of screen and reaffirmed earlier research showing that there’s really no such thing as educational TV or software for very young children."" according to this article."
How do I tell my 14 year old niece that her mom is kicking her out?,"If things have been going as you say then I'd suggest you don't 'tell' her anything - she's 14 and old enough to start having some input into her life so why not ask her? Just summarise the situation between you and her as you see it which is that she has had problems and got into trouble back home etc. but since coming to stay with you see that she is doing a lot better and seems to be happier - then ask her if she'd like to stay with you indefinitely.  Gloss over the bit about her mum kicking her out unless you have to go there. I think there's a good chance she'd go for it.  If it doesn't work then someone's just going to have to tell her outright - if that happens to have to be you then don't pussyfoot around it, outline that the situation isn't working for her or her mum and that her mum would like her to live with you for a while... and then give her some space to deal with it.  Perhaps offer to take her to the DIY store to get some paint to make her room her own or something. If it does go ahead make sure you get some legal papers drawn up to give you legal guardian status too.  It'll save a lot of hassle in the long run. Also, you could draw up and sign an agreement with each other - it won't be legally binding but it's an act of commitment on her part where you can both lay down your expectations and frame it somewhere in the house. As for 'knowing' parenting... I don't think anyone ever can 'know' it - you learn what you need to know as it applies to the child in front of you at that time."
How can I tell parents of a 1-year-old that they're doing it wrong?,"DA01's comment is what I would suggest as well. 
You feel more experienced with babies, and from the sound of it I would agree with you. I've got two main thoughts for you: Of course -- sadly -- this requires that they accept your offer of assistance to the parents. I think I wouldn't specifically ask for permission to do things ""your way"" because that can offend them and they'll reject your offer. It would also mean spending time and attention with the baby; scarce resources that you'd have to take from your own family. As long as his parents are watching a movie, you can interact with the baby. They'll probably be happy to be ""off the hook"" for a while, but there's a hope that they would actually notice that what you do works better than what they do. You could provide the stimuli, interactions, and toys that you feel are age-appropriate. You could offer to take care of the bedtime routine, they might be happy to be ""off the hook"" of that, too. I know that you can't establish a routine with the baby over a short time, but you can demonstrate to the parents that following a fixed daily program helps. This is advice I often hear in the context of someone wanting to help another person who is in dire financial trouble (or headed straight for it) -- it applies to parenting as well. You'll have to accept that you can only offer your help but you can't make them accept it. Even if they do accept your help and the boy has the time of his life in your home, you're not in control of what happens afterward. This is tough to accept. You'll have to tell yourself that you did all that you could, and the rest is not in your hands.  I realize that the family is very mobile but try to keep in touch with the family even after they leave you again. Whenever possible, offer your help. If it's not possible, or rejected, then walk away. As long as there's nothing unlawful going on, you can't force them to change their parenting style, even if it hurts to see their son treated sub-optimally."
How can we potty-train our pre-schooler outside the home?,It seems to me that the other possible reasons for this behavior is: I don't think you can do much about either except for discussing it with your son and letting him know that there is nothing wrong with it and encouraging him. He is only 3.5 so I would give him some time to grow out of it.
Expat child refuses to learn local language,"Diego, I suggest getting him into fun programs.  Get him on a local football team with some kids his age.  He will hopefully have fun and start to see the local kids as his friends.  Even better if you can find a coach that knows a little Spanish and is willing to help him feel comfortable."
"How to deal with a 6 year old who was ""caught"" cheating?","You may not like this answer, but bear with me for a moment, please. So first, let’s recap what happened. Your son checked the answers for a test, during the test, in order to correct possible mistakes. Technically this exactly what cheating is - getting the correct answers from other sources than the own knowledge or conclusions. The standard procedure in cases of cheating is to stop the behavior and take disciplinary actions. Which is exactly what happened here. That’s how schools work, and how they should - grades should always reflect what the student knows, everything else would be unfair to the rest of the class, etc. But I believe you when you say that your child doesn’t know anything about cheating. And I don’t assume bad intentions on his side either, just a desire to give the correct answers. Which is good, of course.  What I would do if I were you: When he comes home, sit together and maybe you want to start with an apology:
Explain that you missed explaining that a test is the moment when he needs to show what he has learned without any help or crutches and that you made the mistake of not explaining that using the correct answers (e.g. from the slip of paper you have him) is called cheating and neither honest nor allowed. This will take some of the pressure off. So if he was scolded for a wrongdoing he wasn’t aware of, it doesn’t nullify the cheating, but as he didn’t know what he was doing, there won’t be any further sanctions. Answer any questions he may have.  But also support the school’s actions, because some children will cheat and they need to deal with it. If he suffered the consequences like everyone else, it may seem unfair at the moment, but also means that they acted according to the general rules, which can be seen as just and fair. You may want to think about it for a moment, when initial impulse of anger has subsided. Do not tell him that you think he was treating unfairly and undermine the school’s authority. And I suggest you re-think your current position of “how could they do it to my child” - maybe it’s a good thing to experience this now (I don’t think a few tears in 1st grade make a permanent trauma). In the long run, it may be a valuable example that helps him stay on the straight and narrow in the long run. We parents do a good and responsible job, but such unplanned teaching moments are very valuable if used right."
How to get my 4yo daughter's fixation on my belly button under control?,"I would try appealing to her sense of empathy. She is young, but should be able to understand that you don't like/feel comfortable with her poking your navel, and if prompted she may be able to imagine what it would be like if there was something she didn't like and someone kept insisting on doing it.
Beyond that, it may be necessary to just let her cry about it. I will tell you, if you go through her childhood allowing behavior that isn't appropriate because you are avoiding a tantrum, you have the tail wagging the dog and before long her finger in your belly-button will be the least of your troubles. She is easily old enough to learn about personal space, not engaging in unwanted touching, and to not be getting her way by pitching a fit.
I really hope that you find this helpful. 😊"
Why my kids don't get excited to see me,"This is pretty normal with parents everywhere - we're not interesting or different, we're just ... there.  Go on a trip without your kids for a few weeks, and you'll see some very excited kids when you return more than likely! In your case, even if the uncle is ""always there"", he's still not a parent, and so has a different relationship.  Parents are safe, comfortable, but not exciting; uncles and aunts are different, because they don't have the same responsibilities and closeness.  They get to do fun things, spoil the children, change things up - while the parents are the ones that make sure they get dressed in the morning, go to school, eat dinner, all the mundane things. That doesn't mean they don't care for their parents just as much - more - than the others, though.  It's just that they're comfortable, not exciting - but comfortable is pretty important when they get hurt, physically or emotionally, are scared, or need a hug!"
At what age should opposite-sex siblings stop bathing together?,"That's actually for the kids to decide I think. As long as they're having fun and generally not objecting or letting you know they'd rather bathe alone, I think it's perfectly fine."
What is the day to day life like as a father?,"It depends on the child - some babies sleep through the night when young, some insist on feeding every couple of hours. Some need constant entertainment, some like wriggling in a basket. You'll probably be tired, and not be able to do as much non baby related stuff as you are used to, but you might not care. You'll probably want to spend lots of the time you are home with your baby - they're fascinating to watch, especially when they start to learn things like repeating your actions or babbling. Your partner will probably be exhausted, especially if breast feeding - it takes a lot of effort, and results in the baby sucking nutrients out! Every baby is different, and you can't tell in advance what they're going to be like. Babies of calm parents might be demanding. Babies of active parents might just want to lie down all the time. They might change this preference every couple of months. You might think you've got a routine, only to find it stops working the very next day. All this means that it is very difficult for a generic ""this is what fatherhood is like"" guide to exist. And that's before taking your lifestyle into account. For example, I work full time, but mostly from my home office, so I see my baby throughout the day. If you work full time in a remote office, you won't - and your experience will be different. There are some books on being a dad around, but they often tend to have a jokey style, as if fatherhood is something that doesn't need serious details. It's a bit frustrating..."
5 year old is completely uncurious,"In my experience, kids are curious when they have interest in something.  She may just not yet have found anything she has particular interest in.  Often you'll be surprised at what they do eventually find interest in; my younger child showed a ton of interest in learning to play the violin, all of a sudden, for example earlier this year. Give her lots of experiences, and don't assume she'll be interested in what interests you.  I'm a big fan of the Montessori approach, and the driving philosophy there is that it is ""child led"" - see where the child wants to go, and help her along that path.  If she doesn't show interest in the books you've read, maybe she needs a different book, or maybe she doesn't care for reading stories others have created but wants to create her own instead. Pretend play is great, and don't worry that the dialogue is empty; it's her way of exploring.  If that's what she's interested in, help her in that direction! Get her clothes to dress up in, things to help make a more interesting scene.  Perhaps consider reading books that involve pretend play themselves!  Calvin and Hobbes, even, might be up her alley. I'd also note that it's not terribly surprising she doesn't follow plot well; five-year-olds don't usually.  Adapt your reading sessions for her attention span, aiming to slowly build it up.  Make sure you're reading books she's interested in.  Focus more on ""character"" than ""plot"" books at this age - that's mostly what she's probably interested in.  Later on, plot becomes more important (to some, anyway)."
Why do kids pick up on violence in cartoons/movies?,"Kids, just like adults, want to ""be cool"", to have fun and to have something they can share with their friends.  TV, video games, pro wrestling, whatever.  And the parts they want to talk about/reenact are going to be the ones that they find most fun or exciting. Think back to the last action movie you saw (for me it was probably Avengers or something similar).  If you got to reenact any scene from the movie, what would you want to do?  The scene where two characters stand in a room and talk for a couple of minutes?  Or the one where Iron Man and Thor are flying around, dodging lasers and shooting aliens?  If it were me, I'd want to pretend to blow stuff up, because it's fun and exciting.  Standing around and talking?  That's normal and I do it every day.  Why would I want to spend my play time doing something boring I do all the time? In addition, kids learn by repetition.  As I recall from Wreck-It Ralph, things got bopped a lot.  Its no surprise that a small child would pick up on the bopping over, say, the nice moral of the story.  The four year olds I've known couldn't pay attention long enough (and probably didn't care enough) to follow the whole story of an hour and a half movie.  They probably can't pick up on little intricacies and all the other little details that makes stories interesting to adults.  They remember the big things and the things that happened a lot.  For example, I can't remember all the details of the Looney Toons I watched growing up.  But I do remember Wile E. Coyote getting nailed by countless anvils, boulders, etc. As far as taking it a bit too far, you have to remember that while 11 year olds are old enough to reason with and in many ways act like small adults, they aren't adults.  Their brains haven't matured like yours and mine.  They don't have nearly the amount of life experience we do.  But they are at least (and probably more so) as susceptible to getting ""caught up in the moment"" as we are.  And that's when the body slams happen.  When we start doing things like that we (hopefully) have a red flag or three fly up and say ""woah, slow down chief"".  We (at least partially) got that from experience, by screwing up and learning from our mistakes.  Kids haven't made those mistakes yet and don't have that automatic warning system built in.  Also, as adults, we have the mental capabilities to separate reality from fantasy.  We know that bullets and body slams hurt.  We also know that pro wrestling is staged.  Kids don't fully grasp that.  And even when they sorta do, they think ""well, I just saw two huge guys jump on each other and no one got hurt.  I can do that too.""  They (and sometimes adults too) overestimate their abilities and underestimate the potential damage.  And then reality usually takes effect and administers nasty surprises to everyone involved. To sum up, they are just being kids and want to have fun doing exciting things.  And they haven't messed up enough yet to know when actions are potentially going do lead to undesirable consequences.  "
Why do parents refer to themselves in the third person?,"It's all about language acquisition.  The concept of pronouns is a little advanced for a 9-month-old who is only vaguely grasping the concept that everything has a name to begin with.  When I refer to myself as ""Mommy"" to my daughter, it reinforces to her 1) who I am and 2) that I have a name just like everything else.  While its initial use is for language development and acquisition, it does sort of eventually become a habit--especially if you have children born back-to-back.  My son is pretty advanced verbally and, at age 4, certainly has mastered pronouns, but now my daughter is learning to talk so my husband and I never really got out of the habit of referring to ourselves in the third person. Clearly there are parents out there who don't refer to themselves in the third-person and their child eventually sort out the difference between common nouns and pronouns, so I don't know if there's any evidence to suggest that it advances your baby's language development any faster, but I think many parents do it naturally without even really thinking about it."
What can I do to encourage my 12 year old son to enjoy productive activities?,"Ask him to write you a list of: Then see what you can do to help get him the information, tools, and time to do these things.  He is your best source of what will interest him you just need to figure out how to drag the information from him. Maybe take him out to dinner, just the two of you, and see where the conversation leads."
How can I forget children toys riffs?,"These are called ""ear worms"".  One method to prevent them is to chew gum. https://www.reading.ac.uk/news-and-events/releases/PR631000.aspx Can't get that song out of your head? Chewing gum could turn off
  annoying ‘earworms' according to new research from the University of
  Reading.  The study found that people who chewed gum after hearing
  catchy songs thought less often about the song than in a control
  condition. Chewing gum also reduced the amount they ‘heard' the song
  by one third.  Previous research has found that mouthing something to
  yourself, or even just moving your jaw around, interferes both with
  short-term memory¹ and imagining sounds².  This study, however, is the
  first to examine what effect chewing gum has on earworms."
Why do kisses stop a child from hurting?,"The major reason is because you say they do. Our brains are powerful and the placebo effect is real. Some doctors are even prescribing placebos, telling the patients ""a number of studies have shown that this pill will help you"" (which is true.) If a parent says something will work, it will work. When my daughter was a preschooler her body reacted a lot to things others don't notice. One bug bite would swell her hand so she could barely use it. She was allergic to Solarcaine. I would tell her ""tell your hand to stop swelling now"" and she, not knowing that was a ridiculous request, would comply - and the swelling would go down. To this day ""a warm cloth"" and ""a cold cloth"" (a regular facecloth with water from the appropriate tap, squeezed out so it doesn't drip) are remedies my young adults will turn to when needed. These things help them to feel better, partly because their whole lives they were told that they would. (And partly because they genuinely do help for some maladies eg a fever is improved by a cold cloth and a bump is soothed by a warm one.)  On top of that, even adults who no longer believe in the power of a kiss from a parent do feel happier when someone acknowledges their pain, the more specifically the better, and expresses a wish for that pain to be lessened. It's true of emotional pain and it's true of physical pain too. BTW, if you don't want to kiss the exact injury site (butts don't scare me, but maybe a scrape is oozing and gross, or a bump is very sore) you can blow it a kiss, or kiss your child's hand to let them deliver the kiss themselves. These also work as long as you are confident that they will."
6 year old is suddenly (shockingly) rude,"This is a difficult problem that a lot of people face.  Children can be the meanest people you meet.  Here's my opinion. I would be bluntly honest with the child.  I would tell him that the things he says aren't nice, and that they hurt your feelings.  Sometimes children can shrug off an adult telling them just that they aren't being nice, because they hear that any time they do anything bad, such as not sharing.  They don't really care at that point if they are being nice or not, but he may understand having his feelings hurt.  I don't think ignoring it will help him.  It may help you, by making him stop eventually, but if your goal is to help him, let him know that it hurts your feelings. On the other side, let him know when he does something you do like.  If he's ever being really positive and doing things you like, be sure to reward that by interacting with him more.  I know that sounds like the alternative to that is ignoring him when he's being mean, but that doesn't work with all kids. All you can do is be honest with him at this age.  Hopefully, he's developed enough empathy for that to help.  I hope it gets better.  Good luck."
How long should I wait before I permit my children to have access to caffeine?,"There has been some research done on effects of caffeine in children. The bottom line is that caffeine is generally safe, but it does have significant effects in children as well as adults.  Note that children are much more likely to encounter caffeine in a soft drink than in tea or coffee; that's what you have to worry about, I think, not Starbucks.  A cup of green tea contains ~15-25 mg of caffeine, which is around the limit where there were no noteworthy effects for a 50 kg child, so if they want to hang out at a cafe, they don't even have to limit themselves to strictly caffeine-free options. Note that persistent caffeine exposure causes physical addiction.  It's not particularly serious, but it is annoying: it means that you have to drink caffeine just to feel normal (instead of lousy), and it doesn't do as much to wake you up.  If you explain this to your children (especially if you can provide examples of people who seem permanently glued to a coffee cup), they might elect to limit their exposure when it's completely under their control."
What can be done to help bright children stuck in a boring school?,"Hah this is a really good and old question.  Let me tell you something else first...  School for a bright kid is not about teaching. And not about learning because if he is as bright and vivid as you say he will learn everything himself.  A school for a child like him, is about learning the hard way in life unfortunately. It is about learning discipline. It is about learning to pay attention even if you are bored as hell, because you wont get by in life without a good concentration skill.. Of course they are bored. School is boring. And flat. And destructive. What you as parent can do is... assure your kid that it will get better. Assure him that he is smart. Don't pressure him to bring home good grades. Just tell him to learn how to pay attention. Make a game out of it.  Tell him if he pays attention, let him map how the teacher walks in the class. What words he / she uses. Create a challenge for him. Create a quest for knowledge for him that he finds interesting.  BUT!! Make sure he studies never the less. Then he must be creative at home. He has to utilize his skills other ways. Show him piano. Show him interesting stuff like physics. Show him the world and he will like it.  Now... You could switch school, you could get a personal teacher and so on and so forth. That depends on how much you have to spend on school. But if not, then do the above and he should be fine, although he will always rebel a bit. :) EDIT: As per Lennart Regebro's comment i'd like to add this link:  http://school.familyeducation.com/home-schooling/human-relations/56224.html It's an article about home schooling vs real schools.  I never said that doing a good homeschooling is bad for a child. But it depends on the parents Time, Money, and Resourcefulness if he can afford it.  I empathize that if you can then YES you should switch to a school more challenging or homeschooling or personal teacher. "
How do you handle a teacher that teaches pseudo science?,"Everything ofcourse depends on the sort of pseudo-science and the amount of it your child is exposed to. If it is something that bothers you and keeps coming back. I would definitely talk about this with the teacher, the principal, etc. But when it's really part of the curriculum, it gets political fast and there probably isn't a lot you can change about it in the short run. But regardless if you are able to change something about it: Talk to your child about it. Make this a learning experience for him/her to develop their own critical thinking skills. What does your child think himself? Does he/she believe the teacher? What would be a way to prove the teacher is right? What would prove him wrong? When should he believe an authority figure, when not?   Also it's good to consider that your own influence as a parent, on norms, values and ways of thinking, is far greater than the influence of a single teacher, or even a school. "
How often should I defeat my children in games?,"I believe this question, the related question, and all the answers I have read are missing the point a game ought to have.  Where the game is not almost exclusively chance (those that are, are irrelevant to the question at hand), the point really is not if one wins or loses -- the point is to learn strategies.  The type of strategy is dependent upon the nature of the game, of course. My daughter is 14 now.  I have not once in her entire life let her win a single game.  I have, however, tried to educate her about the nature of performing better at each particular game.  Sometimes it was in the form of questions (e.g. ""Oh, why did you do that?"" ... ""Hmm... I can see why that seems good, but did you notice...?"") while other times it was in the form of laying my cards on the table (e.g. ""So, I am thinking that if I do ... then it'll be harder for anyone [importantly, not naming her] to do ... and will help me.)  My personal preference is to make any educational component indirect or else the game will seem less game like and more like a classroom, defeating the ""point from her perspective."" In addition to the other answers which show a balance in being a good winner and a good non-winner, this method serves to educate. To my supreme delight, her creative mind has very often come up with quite ingenious alternative methods... some of which do very well and others demonstrate why they are not the best choice.  The consequence of such thinking is that ""the box"" is not her confinement -- her imagination is. Consider also, as appropriate, online games where you and your child can form a team against AI opponents.  This allows you to brainstorm strategies and see how well they perform without competition between you and your child.  My daughter prefers this over her-vs-I at this time in life. Win or lose, did we learn anything useful?  Is that not what the conclusion to any game of strategy should be... a question about personal growth? Side Note: Since the game is about learning, imo, I have let her change a move after chatting with her about it... enforcing the game rules is not the point.  If she understands the consequences and chooses an alternative, why not let her make a change? Final Side Note: Yes, she has won games with me on her own merit and was elated, chatting about it for days -- she trusted that I didn't let her win, but that she earned it, and that made the ""win"" all that much better.  Not only was she elated, but I was proud to see her do so well!"
At what age should I enroll my child in dental and vision plans?,"Basically, enroll them slightly before their services are needed. You're right: There's no reason for her to have dental/vision coverage now when there's no way for it to be used. However, some plans have ""vesting"" times, where the individual must be covered for a particular length of time before being eligible for coverage by some portions of the plan.  (e.g. Must be covered for 2 years before eligible to have braces or dental surgery covered.)  Find out what these are, decide what your children are likely to need and enroll appropriately. As HedgeMage so wisely noted: What is ""medically needed"" and what is ""needed to do X"" may be 2 different things.  Some schools or organizations that you'd like to enroll your child into may require tests or screenings beyond common guidelines. Finally, be mindful of those enrollment windows and don't miss them.  If you or your wife are at all forgetful in any way, the peace of mind might be worth the incremental cost.  I have a memory like a sieve -- getting it all in at once, even if the services were of no use at the time, would be better for me than forgetting to enroll them and have to pay out of pocket for services for a year (or possibly more, if anything other than routine visits were required and not covered). Addendum: If you have access to a Flexible Spending Account (FSA) at your workplace, enroll if you haven't already.  You'll be going to the doctors quite a few times for the first few years for both well-baby and sick-baby vists, and if you have co-pays on visits and prescriptions, they can be quite a chunk of change."
What age do you stop reading bedtime stories?,"I would keep doing it as long as the child is interested in it, and might even press the issue a while later.   Jim Trelease is an advocate of reading aloud thoughout (at least) the elementary years, and his research is compelling. He has published collections of stories and book recommendations that are age appropriate as children grow up. This story of a father and daughter who read aloud together for 8+ years starting in elementary school is compelling. Do be aware of the difference between reading aloud as a fun, together activity and reading aloud as a trigger to wind down.  If the same books are selected over and over, then it is more likely the latter.  That I would stop that part of it by selecting more interesting stories and not repeating very often. I would also move the reading aloud earlier in the routine, say before brushing of teeth. Have you seen the Princess Bride? The story is told as a child being read to by his grandfather."
"Grandmother keeps calling my daughter ""Good girl""","The developmental science on not using ""good girl"" is, as I understand it, pretty nascent and theoretical; I can find a lot of blogs about it, but anything with actual research beyond the ""Buy my parenting book"" leads back to a single 2013 study which makes the fairly intuitive point that if you want your children to work hard, you need to praise them for work. It's not clear from that study how much this applies to a nine-month old, nor is it clear how much the effect of second-degree caregivers such as grandparents has an effect compared to parents, nor, to be clear, is one study of ~50 toddlers showing correlation proof of causation. It may be that the kind of parents who use ""well done"" are also the kind of parents who focus on effort as role models. Nor does the study actually show that you shouldn't praise individual characteristics! The only measured effect is that if you don't praise work, they'll struggle more with working towards solutions when struggling. The researchers didn't find that focusing on individual characteristics stunted the children in any way, so there's nothing wrong with a kid believing she's the smartest, prettiest, best little girl in the whole wide world (right?). - Atlantic summary of the article So you really have two issues: The impact on your child of random praise from her grandmother: The tension between your parenting styles and your mother's. From literally everything I can find, this is not a meaningful effect as long as you and your wife are praising sustained effort and concentration. A lot of the information I found on this says that it is impossible to overpraise a small child and you should be actively looking for opportunities to do it, while even later on, it's more important to praise throughout the process than to limit praise. Your mother's also not wrong that if you're praising the effort as well as the result, it doesn't matter what words you're using. Yes, children take things literally, but they learn the literal meaning from how the words are used. You are their role model for this stuff, their behaviour will be far more impacted by what you demonstrate than what you say. A crucial thing to note is that, unless your mother is acting as primary caregiver (e.g. your daughter is living with her for the full week), the impact of your behaviour and criticisms is going to bury whatever effect Grandma has when she visits. So I wouldn't worry too much about it undermining your own policy. What's more important is that your mother respects your parenting style, but from what you've written, it seems like she is, even if she slips up some times. A lot of grandparents would have taken offence at the implied criticism and ignored it  completely. If you can find a way to assuage your own and your wife's anxieties about the impact (hopefully the article above will help), you can hopefully grant her the slack she needs to be able to interact with her granddaughter on her own terms, while you structure her development the way you want to. Also, be comforted that you can teach your daughter these values directly.. It's taken practice, but [the author's daughter] responds to this comment now with ease. ""I'm always good,"" she'll say with a coy smile, ""sometimes I just misbehave."
"Giving a gift: require that it stays in good condition, or let the child figure it out?","There's a middle ground between requiring the card to be protected, and saying nothing, and that's to inform the child what makes the card special, but then let the child choose what to do with the card. ""This is a rare and valuable card, very special and beautiful.  Because it is special, it is in this special card protector to keep it nice.  If you always keep it in its protector and are careful with it, it will continue to be a special card that you can enjoy.  If I were you I'd want to keep the card nice and special."" Then you let the child choose.  It's his card to do with what he wants.  I might be a bit difficult to remain so detached over it, but to require he treat it a certain way sends the message that the gift you gave him isn't really his. If the child starts to worry about the condition of the less valuable cards, there's nothing wrong with that.  But you could also use that as a moment to explain that we can choose to treat some things more carefully than others if we wish."
Do parents of teens need to lock their liquor cabinet?,"I think my input on this matter should be quite useful, as I'm currently 17 (on the verge of 18, but that's irrelevant), and have done some drinking over the past year or so. My parents have no idea, or at least I assume they don't, and I don't intend for them to find out anytime soon, as I know I'll be punished to some extent. My father is an alcoholic, and while some people might point to that as the cause of my drinking, his alcoholism is what kept me from drinking for the first 3 years I was in highschool, where I have been offered several times.  Anyways, back to the issue. I only ever drink at my friend's house, and we only drink there because his recklessly irresponsible parents don't mind people drinking. Now, they take keys away and make sure nobody gets hurt, but realistically there is nothing they can do to make things completely safe. At my house, I have full access to an entire array of alcoholic beverages, and yet I just don't drink at home. Why? I see no purpose to it. I'll likely get in trouble, and I don't see drinking as the kind of thing somebody would/should do alone. If I really wanted to get past a locked cabinet, I'm sure I could, but I just don't feel the need to. My advice to you is this: warn your children and teach them to say no, and punish them if they ever get caught. However, don't expect them to be completely free of wrongdoing. I have 3 friends who regularly come to parties with us, and not once have they taken a drink. We respect them and don't force it on them. Make sure your kids have respectful friends who would do the same."
Is the 'naughty chair' an effective strategy to punish children?,"Warning, I got carried away here. I'll just let it stand as is now. Is this method sufficient and effective?  Maybe, maybe not. Probably not, except for children that respond well to it, and those did not need it anyways. The same goes for any artifical ""method"" for discipline. Let me give you an opinionated alternative, informed from experience: Let's break it down with cold logic. Children, adults, dogs, everybody learns from consequences (""if I do A, then B will happen to me"").  Nothing else counts, period. Sure, at some stage in life some humans will be wise enough to sit down, and think about how to get better, themselves, and come to profound results this way.  But let's not burden children with this expectation just yet. So, what is a consequence. Simple: Every child can and will understand that. Consequences are not valid when they are disjoint from the cause. I.e., ""I did A, I was not allowed that, and hence I now am under house-arrest while my friends are playing outside"". They are disjoint when there simply is no causal relationship, or when there is noticeable time between cause and effect. Nowhere does a consequence like ""parent is angry and yells at child"" or ""child sits on a naughty chair for an hour to 'think'"" enter the picture naturally. Those things have no relationship to the wrongdoing. The child learns nothing from them, except bad things (e.g., ""parent does not love me"", ""I have to hit back harder"", ""I have to hide wrongdoings"", ""I am dumb"", and so on). A child which is able to learn from such methods would probably not need them, in the first place. Then either they actually did nothing wrong, or you have to somehow bring the consequences to them. But still in a direct, immediate way. Nowhere does this lead to the conclusion that the parents just stand by idle while their children go from one pitfall to the other; or that the children can do whatever they please while driving their parents into madness. This works perfectly with ""fair but tough"" parents. The above is just a framework which, by sheer logic, must work with any being that is capable of learning. And if you are blessed with one of those children which are not capable to learn such things, then punishment would not have helped either. They might just be too young, too hormone-flooded, or the cause/effect relationship too abstract for them. The examples are all simplified. There are many nuances, of course. E.g., the candle: The same goes for anything else. And no, most other things are never so easy. For example:"
Should I correct my daughter's pronunciation of ballet terms?,"My approach to pronunciation issues is simple: pronounce them correctly myself, but only correct my children when it's relevant (meaning, if they're saying something that's actually a different word, or otherwise confusing). She'll eventually pick up the proper pronunciation from you. The only reason I'd do otherwise was if she were a little bit older and she were planning to go into ballet as a career (or at least, to attend a ballet school).  In that case it would be very important for her to know the correct pronunciation, as it could lead to social consequences if she didn't."
9 year old son brought a toy gun to school – how can we get him to understand this isn't just about bringing a toy to school?,"1) The other kid. Talk to your son.  Make sure you listen to what he says and acknowledge it.  His feelings of hurt, anger, and confusion are real.  The aim here is to allow your son to come to the realization that he doesn't want to spend time with this other boy because the other boy causes upset. 2) Removing an iPad for 25 minutes is just as effective as removing it for a week.  Seriously, if it's done carefully the child realizes the mistake and that there are consequences. 3) The gun. Talk to him about the gun.  Why does he think the police were called?  Why does he think he had to see a counselor?  Can he see a difference in the level of reaction between this situation - taking a gun to school - and the last situation - taking general toys to school?  Each time he mentions the other child just calmly state ""we are talking about what you did now.  We are not talking about things that other people did.  We can talk about that later (and remember we talked about him earlier) but now we are talking about what you did."" The aim here is for him to realize that some rules are more serious than others, and that things involving violence to other people are really serious.  I'm not sure if wording like ""sometimes bad guys have guns, and so when you take a toy gun to school people have to make sure that you're not a bad guy."" is acceptable to you. 4) Punishment. I think punishment now is counter productive.  He's had a range of measures taken against him.  I'd concentrate on getting him to understand what was wrong; and on getting reassurance that he's not going to do similar. Then give clear, firm warnings about future behavior.  ""Taking toys to school is against the rules.  You will be punished with X if you do it again."""
Do I keep my daughter's Russian vocabulary small or not?,"is this approach going to help her build connection with a basic vocabulary Yes should I try to broaden it as much as I can and as soon as I can? Yes. Progress the Russian and English vocabulary at the same pace and at whatever pace feels ""natural"". First of all, it's great that you are trying raise a bilingual child. This will be a great benefit to her. Small kids are quite capable of learning multiple languages at the same time if it happens ""naturally"", i.e. through every day interaction with a native speaker. The good old ""Mom speaks Russian"" + ""Dad speaks English"" generally works very well for this. Over time you will find that the environment will take over and English will become dominant, but that's ok. Early exposure to the language lays a foundation that never goes away. They may forget many of the words, bungle the grammar, but they will almost always be able to understand, they will never have an accent, and it'll come back very quickly once being exposed to native speakers again. Regarding the vocabulary: you should progress Russian at the same pace as English. Whatever level feels right in one language should be fine for the other as well. Personally, I'm in favor of ""overshooting"", i.e. expose kids to complexity, abstraction and differentiation early. The things that you draw with are not just ""pens"". They are pencils or markers or crayons or chalk or ball pens and they are all different in how they work and what you can do with them. As soon as the kid is ready to use different utensils they are ready to use the correct word for it. If you feel they are in over their head you can back off a bit, but many kids thrive and love that challenge. Please don't ""dumb it down"" to baby talk. Source: we have raised three (now adult) children. One is bilingual, one is trilingual and one is quadrilingual. The ability to speak multiple languages has created wonderful opportunities for them."
Is it potentially harmful to a 2-year-old to still sleep in a room with her parents?,"Hamad, I think that many children around the world sleep in the same room as their parents -- some for most of their lives. Most of these will/have become perfectly normal, healthy adults. I'd say it is up to you. I think you can research co-sleeping, sleep sharing or family bed to help you make an informed decision. Link -- here is one article from Parents"
How can I get my 4 year old to clean up toys without a battle?,"With our 3.5 year old son, we do this by making sure he knows that he won't get to do the next thing until he puts away his toys.  Want to watch TV?  Put away your toys.  Want to eat some snack food?  Put away toys.  Play hide and seek (his favorite game) or get thrown onto the bed?  Put away your toys.  Once he believed us, that he wasn't going to get away with not putting away his toys, then he started doing it on his own.  The first few times you put your foot down, there will be a struggle, unless you can make it into a game (ie, ""I can only play hide and seek with little girls who put away their toys...."" etc) Also, my wife spent a great deal of time putting everything into its own separate bin.  This organization helped him make sense of all the toys he had available to him, and also gave him a clear spot where to put everything back.  Just throwing everything into a closet wasn't enough guidance; if he got the toy from a specific spot, he wanted to put it away in that same spot. You say you're doing all of these things.  Honestly, there's a big difference between saying you want something (""Honey, please clean up your toys."") and offering a choice with a clear consequence (""Honey, if you do not clean up your toys by the time the timer goes off, I'm going to put them in the garage until Saturday."")  With the second, she has a clear idea of what to expect.  If she really doesn't care about her toys, she won't complain about them going into the box until Saturday.  If she doesn't notice that they are gone for that entire time, you could consider just giving them to Goodwill or your local charity, and your cleanup problem gets solved more permanently.   The first time you offer her the clear consequence, she will not do anything.  She will not believe that you are willing to do anything, if you've been using yelling as a motivational technique rather than action.  Once she sees that you're doing the action-- putting the toys in the garage (or wherever)-- she might flip out.  But that's because you've changed the tune; you've just skipped right to doing something about behavior you dislike, rather than just talking about behavior you dislike."
8-year-old daughter is obsessed with books - escaping from something?,"Disagreeing with commenters and the highest voted answer, I believe you are correct to wonder about what is driving your daughter to read so voraciously. I also want to commend you for your honesty in your self-appraisal. From the comments, it seems that (probably) lots of people were/are voracious readers ""who turned out just fine"". The problem is, there are a lot of people with problems who think they are fine when they aren't. I'm not being judgemental or unkind; it's just that I've worked with too many people with mental health issues to believe that everyone who thinks they are ""just fine"" really are. Ask their partners for a more accurate assessment! (<-- That was meant in jest. Kind of. :D) I have had additional training in mental illness, alcoholism and drug addiction, ran a free mental health and addiction clinic for a few years, and have extensive experience with mental illness, so maybe am more aware of problems than many. Also, consider Maslow's hammer, popularly phrased as ""if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail"". But a hammer isn't all I have. There is a correlation (not claiming it's causative) between intelligence and reading, so it's not at all surprising that your daughter does very well in school. Questions arise about how well she's doing in other aspects of development, for example prosocial skills such as empathy (defined as ""voluntary behavior intended to benefit another""), altruism (sharing/giving/generosity), and cognitive skills (e.g. creativity, problem solving, conflict resolution, etc.), communicative skills that are predictive of future peer relationships. You have told us a lot about your daughter's desire to read, but information is lacking in other areas. But there is enough to arouse some concern. (Of course, you'll list concerns. That's why you posted. But there is so much more...) The three that stopped me in my tracks were: she escapes from the breakfast (or lunch or dinner table) as fast as possible to get back to reading if she's upset (for the smallest of disagreements), she storms off and reads (she says she needs to calm down). This has always been like this to a degree, but I feel it's getting more pronounced. So, she prefers reading to discussions with the family, and problem solving skills are limited. To me, if these behaviors are habitual, they signal a problem. And it's getting worse. How does she get along with other kids at school? Is she kind? (It sounds like she might be brusk with her little sister, but you didn't say.) Does she get along with the others? Does she play at recess or sit with others on lunch break, or does she read? What do the teachers say about her social skills (as opposed to academic)? These are important questions to which we have no answers. My worry is that she uses books to escape from something, as if her thoughts or emotions are threatening to overwhelm her so she needs to distract herself. And if that's the case I'm not sure whether this should be a concern or whether I should be grateful that she has a coping mechanism when things get out of hand for her. It's not an either/or situation. She may simply prefer books to people, finding books less complicated, therefore less work. Maybe this is just another way to phrase your concern, but one may indicate a very introverted person, the other someone without a prosocial bent. There are other possibilities as well. Should I seek professional help? What is a reasonable threshold here? I'm concerned for her longer-term mental health and resilience but I would not in any way want to reinforce any feelings of being different or not belonging to this family. I'm also worried she could lose trust in us having her best interests at heart. Resilience can be taught; read about how to teach resilience. As to being different, we are all individuals. If you place no specific value on being like everybody else, being her own self with her own strengths and difficulties should not be a problem. And as far as trust, that's built up over days, months, and years, not single events. I believe your concerns are valid. The first step might be to talk to her pediatrician about your concerns, including the social aspects I mentioned and any others of concern. Brief report: Patterns of prosocial behaviors in middle childhood predicting peer relations during early adolescence, Early socioemotional competence, psychopathology, and latent class profiles of reparative prosocial behaviors from preschool through early adolescence, and many others."
Get around peer's mind games gracefully,"I think the first thing is to take a step back and consider that they are both acting normally for their age.  It's normal at age 2 and 3 to have limited social skills, limited empathy for others, and very little impulse control.  It's not likely that the little girl is intentionally setting your son up to get in trouble when she gets an aggressive response from him and then cries: She acts in a normal small child selfish fashion, he responds aggressively in a normal small child no-impulse-control fashion, he hurts her, she cries. Put thoughts of your son ""playing the fool"" or falling prey to some advanced strategy of manipulation out of your mind here.  The social dynamics of such young children are not that complicated. My suggestion would be to take several steps.  First of all, continue to reinforce that it's not acceptable to hit/bite/otherwise hurt others (even if they tease or annoy him), second, begin to teach him to use words and other social skills to stand up for himself.  Teach him that when he says, ""No, stop"" that he should expect the other person to listen to that.  Teach him to walk away if others are not playing nice with him. Also be ready to step in yourself.  I think lingering at the top of the slide is likely not anything more than a child who is distracted and hasn't really learned the abstract skill of noticing that she's inconveniencing others, but if there's excessive toy snatching or teasing, or unwanted touching, etc, adults often need to intervene, especially in the form of providing guidance to help kids work it out.  For example, you can remind your son that he can say,  ""No, I am playing with this.""  You can take him aside and calm him before he gets to the point of biting.  You can tell his little playmate ""We don't grab things from others in this house.  You can have a turn when Son is finished."" You can, as you said, also give him tools to handle his frustration, like taking a deep breath, or walking away from the thing upsetting him.  My son responded well to taking a deep breath and 'blowing out a candle' (his finger as the imaginary candle) to cope with frustration, whether caused by another child, or just because he's having difficulty with a task or similar.  Whatever tactic you choose, you should practice it together at first when he is calm, then together when he is slightly upset, and then together during bigger upsets and encourage/remind him to do it himself as needed.  If he succeeds in coping with his feelings without hitting/biting/tantrum, let him know he did well! Teaching him to name his feelings and identify what others are feeling can also help reduce instances of frustration related aggression in children.  Although it's clear that your son's behavior isn't happening at no provocation, your best best for improving the situation is to work with him, and keep a close eye on both children when they are together, since you don't have as much chance to shape the little friend's behavior."
What to do about the incestuous relationship between my daughter and her cousin?,"First of all, the ""how should I handle this"" depends a lot on what your own concerns are. Is your concern the ""cousin"" part? or the ""two 14 year olds"" part? If the latter, is it specific aspect (are they mature enough to consistently use birth control?) or just general age-readiness for sex as a concept? Once you sort out your concerns, the main and best thing is to talk to them - like adults.  Don't criticize (and make clear from the outset that you are not there to criticize) or patronize them.  Don't say things like ""you're too young to know if you're in love"".  Don't only concentrate on the negative. Merely list out pros and cons.  When you list your concerns, prompt them that they are more than welcome to address them in a rational way - if they see that you respect them acting like grown ups (e.g. being greatly relieved and pleased and proud if they DO use birth control), they are likely to be positively reinforced into acting more responsibly in general. If you're concerned about the ""cousin"" part: My advice would be to relax - but inform them (see above on how you should approach communication with them).  Plenty of human cultures have no issues with cousin-length-genetic-distance relationships. However, USA has a bit of a social stigma attached to the idea - which they should be aware of, lest they first encounter the stigma by getting insulted. YMMV based on where you are - in some states it may even be illegal for first cousins to marry. Modern medical science (especially genetic screening) makes the possible long-term concerns about genetic issues due to inbreeding less of an issue, assuming the unlikely outcome that they do marry and have kids eventually. However it's still something they must be made aware of as a risk. This article indicates that the risk increase of genetic issues is less than 2x that of non-related couple; although that is before genetic screening. On the pros side (for your to consider, AND for them to be told to demonstrate that you're not just at it to yell at them :) being cousins, if they do marry, they would almost eliminate one of the biggest friction points for a married couple - ""in-laws"" incompatibility/interference/baggage/bad feelings. being cousins, they are a LOT more likely to consider each others' feelings and care about each other as a person. So, while - as two 14 year olds - they are likely to fall out of love - they most likely won't act towards each other in a jerky/a-holish way that a random 14 year old dumping someone likely will. being cousins who grew up together and close, they already know each others negative sides, to an extend, reducing unpleasant surprises that arise in and threaten any relationship. plenty of people (including famous ones) had successful cousen marriage. Including (but not limited to) President John Adams, Charles Darwin, Einstein, Wernher von Braun, Jacob in the Bible, Abraham Maslow etc...) If you're concerned that they are two 14 year olds having sex: First of all, treat it like any other 14 year olds sex concern. Most importantly, discuss: STDs Pregnancy prevension. If they aren't mature enough to 100% reliably use birth control, they aren't mature enough for sex. If they are (and were doing that before being discovered) it's less of a ground for worrying Discuss possible downsides if the relationship ends. Does your daughter realize how broken up she will be if her cousin falls out of love with her and moves on? Depending on her mental maturity level, she may be ready for it or not, and merely being 14 isn't a guarantee either way. discuss that sex imposes possible negative outcomes if the relationship sours - jealousy, harder negative impact if one breaks things up, etc... discuss what happens when they possibly have to separate, e.g. for college. If you are concerned about ""love and will get married"" part: First, many of your ancestors likely married about that age. So merely intending to marry isn't really a concern. They had less divorce rates than the late-marrying generation me-me-me, too (sorry, had to rimshot at the boomers :) Second, as noted above, make sure they are mentally prepared for the eventuality that one of them changes their mind, and falls out of love. Don't tell them ""this is guaranteed to happen"" (even if chances are it will); but insist that they consider the idea and the consequences in advance. Third - if they seem mature enough - look at the current research in terms of couples compatibility. There are several good books on the topic available and there was very good research into it recently. Find out the summaries, and show them and ask them if they think the research shows that they would be a likely-successful long term couple. "
Do young children hold grudges?,"First - I'm very surprised to see the parents asked you to break the news to the children.  It seems to me like this is the sort of thing they should be doing! Second - what you're describing is normal.  Children need time to process new information, and especially when it's something so totally new to them that they don't have any reference to compare it to, it will take time. Being a bit more withdrawn is normal - she's thinking about it and processing her emotions.  It isn't a ""grudge"", it's just that she hasn't figured out how she feels yet, and doesn't have a good way to express those feelings. What she's feeling right now is concern that she is no longer going to be the ""baby"", and that she'll get less attention.  Children at that age often see their parents love and attention as zero-sum; they also don't see the possibility of getting love and attention from each other!  She may not even fully understand that the new baby will not ""replace"" her... and she definitely doesn't know what things will be like when the new baby comes - how will it shift the social dynamics (which she's still barely learning anyway!) What can help is talking about it, and not dismissing her feelings.  Instead, give her tools to discuss those feelings, and names for the feelings.  It's important to be able to describe, in words, a feeling - she is feeling worried [that things will change in a negative way], sad [that she won't be the baby anymore], angry [that her parents decided to have another baby].  Those are okay feelings!  Tell her that.  Then also point out the things that weren't possible before that will be now - she will get to be a ""big sister"" to the baby, get to help the baby learn and grow, get to teach the baby new things, get to protect the baby.  She'll get someone she can play with who she won't be physically smaller than!  No more automatically losing at games! But she also will have a really important role: she's the only one who understands being a little sister AND being a big sister!  So she can use that understanding to make sure little sister is taken care of properly.  She can think of the things she wished her big sister did differently with her, and do those things.  She can also explain what her new younger sibling is feeling to the older siblings and the parents! Help her see what her new role will be, and how important and interesting it will be.  Then she has positive feelings to go along with the negative ones - and also help her see all the other fun things there will be with three kids.  But also give her space to learn what her feelings are, and give her names for those feelings, so she can understand them; and don't shame them."
Is this normal that my 5 years old kid keep thinking about the bad things,"If you have OCD, then this might be the intrusive thoughts of OCD, as there is a genetic component to it. However, diagnosing kids this young is difficult, and it's not at all uncommon that kids with a psychiatric diagnosis at one point are found a few years later to have been misdiagnosed. So... time will tell. As someone with OCD, you are in the perfect position to understand what these intrusive thoughts are like. However, it might be that she's a really sensitive little girl who is merely contemplating such possibilities, thinking she'd like to say a bad word, smack her sister, see her friend squashed by a truck, or is thinking disgusting thoughts, and just doesn't know what to do with these thoughts on taboo subjects. This is about the time when her lexicon of the more adult taboo words is beginning to grow. It sounds like she might feel guilty about having these thoughts and needs reassurance of her goodness/acceptability.  It's great that she's expressing these thoughts instead of trying to cope with them by herself. I would think your first responsibility is to reassure her that strange and even irrational thoughts are normal and do not indicate what her behavior might be or that she is not a good person. Try to have these conversations in an accepting and matter-of-fact manner, without drama or too much special attention, so that she will not use telling you these things for attention, but do empathize have them. Kids are deeply feeling little beings who feel the complete range of human emotions but don't  always know what to do with them. They need to know they are loved for who they are, not just what they do. Help her to differentiate fact from fantasy. Help her to understand that some thoughts are like hiccups: everyone has them, you can't stop yourself from having them, and they can be anything from mildly annoying to painful. But they go away, and don't cause lasting damage. A rich emotional vocabulary might also help your daughter. If you're familiar with the children's writings of Roald Dahl, you might read some of his books to her aloud and discuss the more outrageous ideas with her. Observe, listen, discuss. And if it looks like OCD, please do talk with her primary care provider and be her advocate. E.g. Immediately in the opening of James and the Giant Peach, James' parents go shopping in London and get eaten by an angry rhino who had escaped from the zoo, leaving him orphaned and adopted by the Worst Two Aunts on Earth. After reading for a while, you can ask questions that lead her to a conclusion that thoughts are just thoughts. ""Do you think it's likely that someone's parents would both be eaten by an escaped rhinoceros? What do rhinoceroses eat? Why did Roald Dahl tell the story that way? Does even having such an idea make Roald Dahl a bad person?"" In our home, I read to our children every day, from Greek, Egyptian and Norse mythology to Winnie the Pooh, Robert Frost to Shel Silverstein. The first two poems my eldest memorized (at the age of six) were Frost's Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening and True Story by Shel Silverstein. Maurice Sendak, author of Where the Wild Tings Are, said, ""In plain terms, a child is a complicated creature who can drive you crazy. There's a cruelty to childhood, there's an anger. And I did not want to reduce Max to the trite image of the good little boy that you find in too many books.""

How do I help a child overcome fear of ghosts?,"It is important to recognize that even though we, as adults, know that there are no such things as ghosts, to the child they are real. And no amount of logic will convince them otherwise. You have to accept, for a while, that what they think is real, is actually real, and then you can deal with making it not scary. So rather than trying to reverse their thinking, try to control it and direct it. My son (5 years old at the time) was sure there were ghosts. So we talked about ""How do they get in the house?"" Apparently they can come in the windows. What he didn't know, and I did, was that it you put a piece of tape in the corner of the window it blocks the ghosts. He was also afraid of vampires (did I mention I hate Halloween). He was afraid they would get in his room. What he didn't know was that vampire are afraid of blue carpet... oh did I mention his room has blue carpet in it. I couldn't convince him that neither one was real, but I could divert and redirect his concerns until he was more rational and we could talk about make-believe and reality. I hear that if you put a piece of tape over the corner of a mirror it blocks out ghosts just as good as it does on windows. Hope this idea works."
How do you stop a child from talking back without discouraging them from asserting themselves?,"First of all -- now that you know the bullying is going on it should be eliminated, period.  Most 3.5yo kids don't yet have the nuance to understand the difference between standing up for oneself and being mean.  That's what grown-ups (and martial arts lessons, later on) are for.  If the day care center is letting it go on, choose another one.  That's a serious screw-up. As for the backtalk, it's a thing kids do to try to gain power in a situation.  I diffuse it pretty quickly with the following technique: I am fine with my son stating a specific objection to something. For example, ""no, I won't eat at the table"" is not okay, but ""Can't we eat outside, it's the first nice day this week!"" is okay.  If he tries the former, non-specific version, I just say ""that's not a reason"" and ignore further pleas unless they are specific.  This is a building block of being able to hold his own in a discussion, not to mention a good conflict-resolution skill.  When he is specific, I'll give in (if his reason is good), offer a compromise, or explain why we can't/won't do it his way. However, once I've said ""that's enough"" or ""end of discussion"", it's over, period.  I say it once, and go on behaving as if there was no objection.  If he doesn't do as he was told, he goes straight to time-out.  I never respond to yes/no wars -- as Bugs Bunny has many times demonstrated, you can't win one of those."
Is visiting museums worthwhile or beneficial for a toddler?,"I started looking into research relating to the value that toddlers might get from a museum visit, and I'm almost overwhelmed by the number of quotes and discussions I found (much of it from the museum's perspective). The Importance of Taking Children to Museums from the National Endowment for the Arts Art Works Blog (the post includes links to a great deal of other research and discussion) There’s no shortage of research indicating the benefits of museum
  visits for children. They can provide memorable, immersive learning
  experiences, provoke imagination, introduce unknown worlds and subject
  matter, and offer unique environments for quality time with family... The Toledo Museum of Art has ""baby tours"" to encourage families with young children to visit. And they tell you why: ... an art museum is a rich source of visual
  stimulation for babies. Introducing infants to works of art promotes
  early neuron connections in the brain. And for the verbal toddler,
  interacting with an adult in naming images and describing different
  characteristics in a work of art lays the groundwork for visual,
  cognitive, and language development. Looking At Art With Toddlers, a paper on the Smithsonian Institute website, has a number of arguments in favor of children going to an art museum and cites a lot of research. Long before children can speak, their responses to shapes, sounds, and
  other necessary phenomena around them establish their personal
  personalities and their styles of interacting with the world...
  Aesthetic experiences can enhance cultural sensitivity, promote
  language development, and improve the quality of young children's own
  art making. For aesthetic development to occur, children need
  experience with beautiful environments within the school and home,
  exposure to fine art and opportunities to discuss art and beauty with
  thoughtful adults. Also from the Smithsonian Institute, Early Learning in Museums: A Review of Literature is a literature review with a more academic approach. However: This review indicates that: 1) museums, with their real artifacts,
  dioramas, and immersive exhibitions provide a uniquely positive
  environment to foster learning by young children; 2) young children
  are interested in artifacts and exhibitions in traditional museums and
  can learn disciplinary-specific information, such as history or
  biology, long before they encounter those disciplines in formal school
  settings; 3) young children approach artifacts and exhibits
  idiosyncratically based on their individual motives and interests;
  they learn by encountering real artifacts which they talk about with
  others, and about which they sometimes express their reactions in
  various verbal and artistic ways; 4) appropriate adult encouragement
  can enhance children’s learning and exploratory behaviors in museums So we can pretty safely conclude that taking the toddler to the museum is beneficial. I think that the key is understanding the difference between a child's ""great"" museum experience and a more traditional adult museum experience. So I also have a few general tips on adapting expectations for a museum visit. A stroller or other carrier is pretty critical. Not only does this
keep the toddler strapped down (eliminating any chance of an eager
rush towards a priceless artwork), but with my kids, the stroller
""signalled"" that it was time to sit still and take in the scenery.
Whether it was a walk through the park, a hike in the woods, or
taking a tour of a historic house, they were pretty content to look
at the scenery and enjoy the experience. Some museums don't allow strollers, but we had a backpack carrier as
well that I never heard an objection to. Be willing to walk quickly. Not only does this let you fit in more
museum time before boredom really takes hold, but it brings the new
visual experiences more quickly. Many adults are capable of gazing at
a beautiful artwork for minutes. A toddler prefers to look at it, be
interested briefly, and then find something new to look at. Depending on the museum (some prefer a very quiet, contemplative
atmosphere), chat with your child about what you see that would be
interesting from their perspective. A Sunday on La Grande Jatte may be
a wonderful example of pointillism, but a toddler wants to know about
the doggies and the monkey. (I didn't even know there was a monkey
until my toddler pointed it out.) Look into whether a museum has a child-oriented area in addition to the
primary exhibits. Even art and history museums may have a room where kids
can create their own art (supplied with paper, crayons, and various craft
supplies) or get to handle replicas of artifacts. It's a useful break
where they can be childish in between calmer walks through the
galleries."
How do you find great reading material for a child whose reading ability is far outstripped by his/her comprehension?,"Check out some of the things Terry Pratchett has done. Even when he writes for children and young adults and the language is simpler, the ideas communicated is still the same advanced Terry Pratchett ideas. I've read many of his young adult book sand enjoy them just as much as his ""normal"" books.  If your reference to ""Mittens the Kitten"" is this: http://www.amazon.com/Adventures-Mittens-Kitten-Ruth-Miracle/dp/1410775933 he might be able to read The Bromeliad Trilogy, ""Truckers"", ""Diggers"" and ""Wings"". It's funny and exciting even for adults. I read it twice and do look very much forward to reading it to my daughter. A bit more advanced is the Johnny Maxwell trilogy and the books about Tiffany Aching. I'd say all of these books contains subtleties and ideas far above the difficulty of the language, and in addition they are hilarious. So if your son can read them, he should enjoy them. I did. :-) "
7-year old with Asperger's caught stealing - how to deal with that?,"As someone with mild Asperger's, I think I can shed some insight onto this situation. Let's look at what happened, as well as giving some ways to prevent this type of behavior in the future. The Event As a 7-year-old, your child should already have a basic sense of right and wrong - don't hit others, be nice to their parents and teacher, etc. Where the line blurs for some young children is the concept of ownership. While this is a naturally learned boundary for the vast majority of children, Asperger's causes most of those ""natural"" boundaries to be formed differently. So what does this mean? As we often assume normal development in most children, it's likely that the ""normal"" boundaries were never especially reinforced for your child. Concepts like ownership boundaries are complex, but Asperger's artificially tries to ""simplify"" it. That is, your child created their own boundary that ""makes sense"" to them. Phrases like: I need/want this object, therefore a classmate wouldn't mind if I took it or Sally wouldn't mind if I took her pen because I don't mind if someone took my pen are all possible configurations. Mind-Blindness This was a concept I was introduced to in order to better explain the how and why of Asperger's. Basically, mind-blindness is the core of Asperger's. Take a look at this situation, for example: Sally has a choice to hide a ball under one of three objects: a box, a chair, and a table. She chooses the box and leaves. Not long after, Adam enters the room. Where does he look for the ball first? When tested on questions like this one, children with Asperger's would almost always answer ""the box"". Why? Because Sally put the ball under the box, of course! Mind-blindness is the inability to think of ""the other side"" of things, such as in terms like Billy should know where the ball is because I know where the ball is. In your case, your child made an incorrect conclusion - assuming that taking something that wasn't theirs was okay - with other people's feelings that, to them, made perfect sense.  Learning From Mistakes Seven years old is still very young. Your child is learning a lot at this age, possibly in more ways than one. This incident can shed some insight into how your child thinks. They can also re-learn certain concepts from teachers and their parents, such as boundaries of ownership. If you haven't already, I highly recommend getting Tony Attwood's The Complete Guide to Asperger's Syndrome. or his guide for parents. Both of these books summarize classic symptoms and gives parents insight on how to solve problems with their child. This incident is a prime opportunity to better understand what your child is thinking, and how you can plan ahead for the future. Keep in mind that this works both ways - you and your child both benefit from understanding one another. Punishments As with any child, it is very important to reinforce concepts of right and wrong. @anongoodnurse explains it best - the child should be told that what he did was wrong, and reinforce that if it happens again. To add to this, though, it is vital that you properly explain why you're punishing them. Sitting down and having a discussion is important for children with Asperger's, as it gives them an opportunity to talk and explain themselves. From there, you can demonstrate the ""correct"" behavior for the future."
Explaining mental illness to children,"Our 10 year-old has obvious mental and physical symptoms of her cerebral palsy, so we've had this conversation many times. We've found that adults are the ones who have problems coming up with explanations.  They try to overcomplicate it and be too politically correct.  Kids are usually satisfied with something simple and direct.  They ask out of honest curiosity, not out of malice. We often have kids ask, ""What's wrong with her?""  While their parents are still stammering, we answer, ""Her brain is hurt because it got squished a little when she was born.""  Sometimes they ask follow-up questions, which we answer just as directly, but usually the first answer is satisfactory.  The most common response is ""Oh,"" then they carry on with whatever they were doing before. In your situation, I would wait until the kids bring it up with something like, ""Why couldn't Relative come?""  Then just be direct.  ""She stays home a lot because she's worried about germs, but I'm sure she misses you too.""  If they ask follow-up questions, answer those as directly as possible without going into long-winded explanations. I would leave the illness out of it as much as possible, especially since it appears you don't understand it very well yourself.  Explain the symptoms in a matter-of-fact way, as a part of who she is, but not the defining part. Tell the kids other nice things about her that maybe aren't as obvious. Explain about the accommodations you expect them to make for her, but emphasize that outside those areas she should be treated the same as anyone else.  Honestly though, kids have a lot easier time accepting people's differences than adults do."
Raising a bilingual child when one parent knows both languages while the other doesn't,"Much like Torben, my husband and I are also in a similar situation.  I'm American and my husband is Danish.  My son prefers to use Danish more than his English, but that is natural since he's exposed to it more. However he knows if he is speaking to me, he MUST use his English - I won't respond to him otherwise (emergencies aside).  He understands everything said in English, can count and say his alphabet and everything he can in Danish as well.   I read him bedtime stories in English and my husband Danish. Sometimes in public you'll get the 'wtf' looks when you use a different language, but I ignore them and continue using English only.  "
"""I want to do that on my own"" - how to improve situation if they don't actually *do* it?","I'm pretty sure my mother could have written the same question about me when I was your daughter's age (which was quite a while ago). Specifically when it comes to the morning routine, we eventually arrived at a working solution. For various checkpoints (be awake, enter bath, leave bath, leave house) we had agreed times by when they had to be reached. As long as I didn't fall behind the plan, my mother wouldn't bother me. If I was late (by the agreed-upon schedule), I'd (grudgingly) accept a reminder. This not only helped reducing conflict between us, but it actually worked well as motivation (I didn't mind being late to school too much, but getting woken up by my mom? Horror!). Getting to such a plan wasn't easy. We had (and still have) quite different ideas on how tight a suitable schedule for such things is. To even talk about this calmly, we had to do it when I was in a decent mood (ie not in the morning when it was relevant). We didn't really do that, but I'd reckon the approach could be applied to more situations. Basically, agree generous parameters such that if your daughter manages to stay inside the ""safe zone"", you promise her that you won't interfere, and in return, she tries to be more gracious about you taking action if stuff gets out of control. A difference between your third point is that the parameters are agreed between the two of you, not unilaterally set by you."
How do I deal with my wife's violent outbursts around our child?,"You're right to be concerned with regard to your daughter's emotional well-being. She is in for a very rough life (it doesn't end when she leaves home) if something doesn't change. In 1986, Ney et al published a seminal study showing that of 5 kinds of abuse (physical, verbal, sexual, physical neglect and emotional neglect), verbally abused children were most negatively affected, with low self-esteem, self-directed anger, aggressive behavior and pessimism about their futures.  You're an adult, and you can handle your wife's unpredictable (or predictable) mood swings. One reason is that as an adult, you know how to keep yourself safe. You are in a situation of being equally as (or maybe even more) powerful as your wife. You have power over your physical self. You can probably also remove yourself physically from an alarming situation. Your daughter, however, is completely helpless, and depends on her parents to keep her safe in a world that has more than enough challenges to deal with. To allow her to be subjected to a volatile and frightening parent will do a considerable amount of psychological damage. Imagine, if you can, how you would feel about your wife's rages if you were in an accident and were consequently paraplegic with a limited ability to communicate. You are with her all day (no going off to work) and pretty much totally dependent on her. You have no way to help your wife calm down or to negotiate the situation. She's screaming down at you in your wheelchair, and you can't just roll yourself away. There's little you can do except endure her rage each time and hope she doesn't throw something at you or hit you this time. If you turn your back to her, will she get even angrier? If you can imagine that, you might have a window into your daughter's situation. Young children of emotionally labile parents are sometimes afraid their parent will kill them. Furthermore, your daughter has no recourse except to hope for your protection during these events, which are traumatic regardless of at whom the rage is directed. Add to that the fact that young children think the world revolves around them. Your daughter will think it's her fault that mommy is so angry. She will grow up thinking she is a bad person who deserves to be emotionally abused. You say that you don't want to leave your wife, and I want to respect that. But know that to stay, you are acting as if her raging is acceptable behavior (in action, not words).  You can't protect your daughter while her mother is a primary caretaker. As you said, I confront my wife about it and she admits it's wrong and promises not to do it again - but she does. I genuinely don't think she has any control over it. You may think she's unable to control it, she might think she's unable to control it, but the truth is, she has no valid reason - none whatsoever, really - to refuse to seek help for her mood disorder. You don't have many options if you want to stay in this relationship. Some of them are Is the latter option legal? It is if your daughter is being abused (verbal abuse counts.) Start gathering proof with your smart phone, and store the evidence where she has no access to it. Likely she will rage at this as well, but it seems to me you need to start doing something radically different if you want her to get counseling. What you can do for your daughter is limited, but every bit helps: love her, validate her, give her an emotional vocabulary so she can express herself ('scared/sad/mad/happy/etc.), make sure she knows that your wife's anger is not her fault, and protect her from your wife's rages. She needs you. ‡Your wife blame-shifts: when she's angry, she blames someone or something else for behavior she engages in. It is likely that initially when you stand up to her, she will become angrier and will blame you. You need to be prepared (this is where your therapy will help) to handle this. It is likely to get worse before it gets better. There's more literature here than you can shake a stick at.

"My child has chickenpox, am I infectious?","You may be carrying the virus You may not show any symptoms, but if you've had chicken pox already, you most likely have the virus in your system even without being exposed to the virus recently.  This virus, the varicella-zoster virus, remains dormant in your system, and can become active later in life, causing shingles. While shingles can't be transmitted from person to person, an active outbreak of shingles can infect someone with chicken pox, if they've never had it, or if they have a weakened immune system (such as a newborn infant). Note that the transmission methods for chicken pox and shingles are different.   Chicken pox can be contagious before symptoms even appear, and spreads through contact with bodily fluids, or from airborne virus spread from someone who is infected and coughing and sneezing.   Shingles is spread through direct contact fluid from the rash blisters, and not through sneezing, coughing, or casual contact. However, just because you've had chicken pox as a child doesn't mean that the only way you could possibly transmit the virus is through direct contact with a shingles rash.  While most people who have had chicken pox in the past have a lifelong immunity to it, rarely some people do get chicken pox a second time.  If you are one of those rare cases who get chicken pox a second time, you could be contagious without showing any symptoms (yet). Therefore, if you know you've been exposed to the chicken pox, even if you've already had it, do not go.  It simply is not worth the risk. While frustrating that you might have to stay away and can't see the little tiny baby, it'd be terrible if you made them all ill. I would suggest that you call the close friend and tell them.  If you are still worried, consult your family doctor or medical helpline. Some information on breast feeding and chicken pox: http://www.netwellness.org/question.cfm/8650.htm"
5-year old goes to pieces when talking about her/seeing pictures from when she was younger,"My daughter went through this, and it took a few years until she was old enough to articulate what made her sad about the old photos and stories. While we were all reminiscing and fawning over her cutest, most-precious photos and the priceless moments of days gone by, what she was hearing was that she was no longer so ""baby cute"" and how we missed having that baby around she no longer was. Give it time. It is easily fixed. Keep taking those family photos of those precious moments, regularly and often. But Invite her to add them to the family album with you. That will help her realize she's still the star of this running saga. The photos in those newest pages will only go back a few months. That's a good thing. Don't start paging back too far. Over time she will start to realize on her own that there is a long, unbroken line between those older family photos and the girl she is today. Then she'll start flipping back on her own. For the next few months-to-years, make a concerted effort to only talk about those old family photos and childhood stories in the context of how far she has come. Instead of saying ""OMG, how cute that you dumped those Spaghetti O's on your head!"", say instead: ""Goodness, remember when you didn't even know how to feed yourself?"" ""Wow, when you were born, you didn't even have any hair.""  ""It's hard to believe that only 4 years ago, you couldn't even walk!"" ""You are such a BIG girl!"" <big relieved hug> Of course, be careful that you're not delving too far into making fun of her as a baby… but at five years old, she should be able to start enjoying a bit of self-deprecating humor in the context of how far she's come. She may even come to enjoy hearing those silly little girl stories, and ask you to repeat them over and over. ""Daddy, tell me about the time I ran out with my poopy diaper. And tell me about how I spit milk out of my nose! Again! Again!"" Oy. When you find yourself telling these stories for the 500th time, try mixing in a variation on the theme: ""Not only that, but did you know that once you…?"" That's just another way to break out the old stories (and eventually, the old photos) in an amusing and entertaining way where she will always be the star!"
"Is the ""cry it out"" approach harmful?","Preface: If you are reading this page because you are trying to decide how to handle your child's sleeping, please go and read the link that Doug T provided in a comment on the question (http://www.parentingscience.com/Ferber-method.html), there is a lot of good advice and plenty of creative ideas on how to handle your children's (non)sleeping. At the risk of getting shot down for being subjective (I can't see anyone doing clinical trials on this topic...), I'll have a go: I'd say that mid-to-long-term effects are plausible if you consider that a person's psychological make-up is a continuum built from acquired experience. The child - and all their experiences - don't just cease to exist when they become an adult, even if they can't remember all those experiences. The idea that kids are robust little critters who can bounce back from anything has been around for a long time, and it's definitely got history on its side. But then, not so long ago, babies were operated on without anaesthetic because they weren't considered 'conscious' enough to feel pain. (Like fish, or something! I can't find a source that I like for this, but there are a lot of references out there). Obviously, it's easier for us as parents to believe that our kids are going to turn out ok no matter how much we screw up, but that doesn't make it true. And going to the other extreme is no good either.  I think kids can bounce back from isolated negative experiences - just like they can bounce back from a bad night, or a childhood illness. But the problem is with repeated negative experiences, which are far more likely to drill their own negative paths into the child's neurons... Here's what I suspect might happen in the case you outlined: What does it teach you when your mommy-daddy-come-help-me screams result in nothing happening? Well it could teach you that you are alone in life, and that the universe is a cold, dark, dangerous place*. I wouldn't expect that child to grow up into someone with a sunny and optimistic outlook. *Obviously, you may actually believe that this is true, so the child has learnt a valuable lesson: did you by any chance cry yourself to sleep when you were a baby? :) EDIT Found the book I was thinking of: ""Why love matters, how affection shapes a baby's brain"" by Sue Gerhardt. Note that it's too long since I read the book to assert that what she says supports what I wrote above. But it's definitely an interesting trip into the frontier between experience, emotion and brain chemistry."
How do I explain to a 4 year old that our family pet is sick and needs to be put down?,"I would definitely tell him in advance, to give him a chance to process the fact in time, and to say goodbye to the cat. Morah made a good point about leaving the sickness out of the explanation, that may be one strategy. However, my feeling is that telling that the cat just died, without any clear reason, may be equally frightening for the kid if he has a tendency to get frightened by such things. So I would rather explain that the cat died because it was very severely ill, and the doctors couldn't save its life; that there are different kinds of sicknesses, some just make your nose run for a few days, others may make you sick for longer times, and need doctors' assistance and medicines to recover. And sometimes even doctors can't help, and one dies, which means that it goes away, and we won't ever meet again. I think a lot more depends on your mood and internal feelings than the exact words you use. If you feel uncomfortable talking about death, your son will sense it and it will make him agitated or fearful too. In Western culture, there is a lot of fear about death, and this is the way we pass it on to our children. We don't talk about it, and we hide our own dying relatives and pets out of sight, into darkened hospital rooms or the vet's lab. But our feelings we can't eliminate, only repress. And the children sense them anyway. So if he asks, I would not hide the fact that all of us, people, animals, plants, will die one day. But for him (and us), it's going to happen many, many years after yet. However, I agree with Morah that there is no need to try to explain him too much. Give him the basic facts and then let him ask questions. If he asks a tricky one, like ""where does the cat go when it dies?"", you may ask back ""what do you think?"". Then continue the answer depending on the level and direction of his ideas."
Does it hurt my baby (developmentally) if she watches while I'm on the computer?,"Yes and no: Yes the rule of thumb is equally valid for computer screens as for TV screens.
No your daughter won't become a raging lunatic from watching you code. The recommendation against watching TV is not, as I understand it, because it shortens the attention span, but because it overloads the mind. A small child is not mentally capable of processing so much visual input and will be overwhelmed. Especially if the child is sitting too close to a big screen. If your child is far enough away that the screen is not a major visual object, and you're not flicking between apps that are visually wildly different (Outlook, MS Word, Firefox, Eclipse -- they all look the same from the other side of the room), then I see no harm coming from the monitor itself.  Baby mobiles are popular with infants because their slow visual changes are pleasing. I'm not saying your monitor is pleasing in the same way (but a screensaver probably would be!), but it does explain why she stares at it so much. Also, whatever engrosses you is bound to stir your child's attention too. Kids don't want to play with the parents' smartphones because they're smartphones but because the parents constantly play with them - so they must be intriguing."
18-month-old kicked out of church nursery,"Since you're talking about church, I take it religious beliefs should be on topic here. There are two commandments that supersede (and contain) all the others. One of them is You shall love your neighbor as yourself. If you have not put yourself in the shoes of the other parents, their children, and the nursery staff, that is where you should start. Would you have your own child repeatedly pushed, bitten, have their hair pulled, toys thrown at, etc.? If the answer is ""Yes"", then you're good to go (continue feeling unduly put upon/excluded.) He was kicked out for... trying to bite other kids and babies (I honestly doubt this part happens very often as we don't see this much at home)  I don't know how to say this delicately, but you're assuming bad behavior on the part of the nursery staff (misrepresentation/lying?) because you don't see it at home. On the other hand, you don't have a large bunch of babies and toddlers at home every week to see this interaction for yourself. Unless you can see into someone's heart, it's better to assume a fellow congregant is telling ""their"" truth until you have evidence to the contrary than to do the opposite. It's also a lot less embarrassing when you find out you were wrong. Would you enjoy volunteering to be responsible for 10-15 kids when one of them pushes over babies in carriers, bites, pulls air, etc., taking up most of your attention Sunday after Sunday? If the answer is ""Yes"", then, again, you're good to go. If the answer to either question is ""No!"", then you need to frame the entire question positively:  How do we solve this problem? It appears that your child is not ready for relatively unsupervised play with others. That is true of many toddlers of that age, and one-on-one play dates are a good place to start teaching rules of acceptable play (or more precisely parallel play) interactions, not necessarily sharing yet, but the idea of trading when conflict comes up, the no-hitting/pushing/other. It's possible that time outs aren't going to be terribly effective yet, but I would start them anyway. Removing the child from the situation of inappropriate behavior/hurting someone else if gentle corrections are ineffective is completely appropriate (as is getting the parent to come take their child from the nursery if the staff cannot control them). Toddlers react to frustration with anger or crying, since they don't have words to express themselves yet, power to change the situation, or enough impulse control. An emotional vocabulary will help with disappointments as the child gets older, and time outs help with better decision making. Power comes with age and good decision skills. When the child can play one-on-one without expressing frustration in the form of hitting, etc., then you can return them to group play to see how they do, supervising the first few times. For teaching time outs, I would like to recommend the book 1-2-3 Magic by Thomas W. Phelan. Read from cover to cover before instituting, please. About church attendance, it's usually members of the congregation who staff the nursery. They are usually volunteers, in short supply, and also miss the sermon, so they are not asking anything of you that they are not giving themselves. Many parents of the nursery age kids take turns volunteering in the nursery. Doing so might also help provide some perspective on how difficult it is when one child repeatedly makes it difficult for everyone. So, in dealing with your child, I'd recommend teaching ""manners"" during one-on-one play, and then moving to larger groups of kids. In dealing with the church, love your neighbor, asking no more of them than you are willing to do yourself. If you cannot abide by the idea of volunteering in the nursery, then ask the pastoral staff for guidance in helping to solve the nursery staffing problem. Edited to address new information: We have a five year old who does like to ""play rough"" with him, but we have tried to calm that down because we fear that may be part of what's causing the problem. Although jealousy between siblings is featured in works as old as the Bible (Joseph and his brothers; Esau and Jacob), the actual study of ""normal"" sibling relationships themselves is relatively scarce, so I will only present behaviors I have seen myself in my family, extended family and my practice. Many children (especially preschoolers) are jealous of their younger siblings, and since they (usually) can't just march up to them and punch them, they mask their aggression in ""rough play"".  I suspect this does have quite a bit to do with the toddler's behavior, so you need to work on changing this dynamic at home as well. For this, I would also recommend 1,2,3 Magic as a starting point. None of this means you have bad kids; it honestly sounds fairly normal for the situation. It's a lot to deal with. You have my sincere sympathy. An example: my first constantly ""accidentally"" bumped into the second, knocking them to the floor. In preschool, the first went from angelic to fierce biter immediately after the birth of the second. The second, in turn, was jealous of the first, at seven months crawling over to bite the foot of the first when they were seated on my lap. "
How can I convince my child to write?,"First, please know that I agree 100% with @David Hedlund's answer in its entirety. I just want to address one particular point that needs to be stressed. His teacher says if this type of behavior continues, his language base will be weak and create problems for him in upcoming years. Language skills aren't weak because a preschooler can't/won't write their letters. I would question (seriously) how that teacher came to that conclusion. Having said that, I would, as David suggests, have a conversation with the teacher as tactfully as possible about backing off from forcing the activity at preschool. Preschool should be a fun socializing opportunity, not a stress-inducing hurdle in life to overcome. Read to him about things he loves, about funny things, about animals and insects, etc. Reading (or listening) and vocabulary acquisition/comprehension are the basis for language skills. Babies learn language skills before learning the alphabet. If you want to encourage letter writing (after a period of backing off), make it fun. There are some suggestions in the link under your post. Making learning and doing a positive influence are far more likely to help him in the coming years than forcing him to do something that makes him cry."
How to handle an 11 year-old son who acts like a girl?,"First, I think it is worth noting that gender identity and gender roles are not the same as sexual orientation--liking girly things is not the same as being gay. As far as your specific issues go, I agree with Rhea that these are not big signs that your son is experimenting with an alternate gender identity. Hanging out with girls, using female avatars in video games, and playing volleyball are not unusual behaviors in heterosexual men. But I'll assume that there is something more going on here. Even so, adolescents and teens sometimes experiment with different roles, just to see where they fit in. Your son knows what things are girly and what things aren't, what he doesn't know is how he thinks and feels about everything in the world. He needs space and time to figure this stuff out.  He also might make fashion choices--for example, wearing makeup or nail polish--that are more about what music he likes than about gender identity. Punk fashion involved makeup, nail polish, and skirts for guys when I was in high school, and I'm sure there's some kind of fashion statement like that now. The important thing is that he needs to feel comfortable talking to you about whatever is going on in his life. If his behavior isn't dangerous to himself or others, and if he is still doing the things he needs to do like chores and homework, try just leaving him alone about this sort of thing. The important thing is that he needs to feel comfortable talking to you... if he is being bullied at school, for example, you don't want him to think that you'll blame him for acting ""girly"". You want him to trust you so that he'll tell you if he's having problems. Making him feel like you think he is gay–and that you think that's a bad thing–because he wants a diary is probably going to make it harder for him to talk to you about whatever is going on in his head. Of course it is possible that your son is gay. It's also possible that one of his siblings is gay and he is not. Being gay is not a lifestyle choice or the result of a persons upbringing, it's a sexual orientation, something people are born with. Stereotypes aside, gay men are not always effeminate, gay women are not always butch, effeminate men are not always gay, butch women are not always lesbians. You truly can't judge a book by its cover. But if one of your children is gay, the best thing you can do is to accept them as they are. This is difficult for some parents, so there are organizations out there that can help you adjust, notably  PFLAG (Parents, Families, and Friends of Lesbians and Gays). Overall, I wouldn't worry about this too much. As parents, the best we can hope for is to raise children who turn into happy adults with their own place in the world. Keep an open dialog and focus on things that matter."
How early should you teach children how to code?,"At age 4 I was given a ZX Spectrum 48k computer and a book published by Usborne called BASIC for Beginners. From that moment on I was hooked. The next year I was given Practice Your BASIC. By age 8 we had a PC in the house, and I started trying to teach myself C using the book The C Primer. Pointers really confused me back then, and I gave up after a while and didn't go back to C for at least ten years. I amused myself writing DOS batch scripts, and the occasional light dabble with very short bits machine code gleaned from computer magazines. My brother, however, had no interest whatsoever in programming. I would recommend you provide your child with the tools (a computer and reference materials) and see if it's something they're interested in or not. Note that I was never pushed into it, nor even supervised while I was doing it - it was completely self-driven, which I think made it more interesting and exciting for me. If I had to be sat down and shown then it would have felt more like a chore, and maybe then I wouldn't be the programmer that I am today? (The Usborne programming books from the 1980s are now available for free online, by the way: https://usborne.com/books/computer-and-coding-books )"
How can we 'gracefully' stop taking our 5yo for a late-night toilet visit every night?,"L is now so habituated to weeing at this time of night that she
  basically doesn't wake up at all during the process. When we talk to
  her about it, she denies any knowledge of it happening at all... So first step, stop carrying her. Wake her, as gently as you can, and make her walk herself to the bathroom. I would pick a weekend to start this process, as it's likely to disrupt her sleep before she becomes accustomed. Walk with her, keep her company, but do not pick her up. Then, once she's used to waking up to go pee, experiment with seeing if she will get herself up with your help, but then walk herself to the bathroom and take care of business. Then you can move to the natural next step of not waking her yourself, and see if she can learn to do it on her own. You could also try to manage her need to pee by witholding drinks after a certain time in the evening, and insisting on a 'right before bedtime' pee session. Good luck!"
Long-term preparations for becoming a parent?,"Learning about the mechanics of parenting and looking after a baby is not that hard. You have almost a year to learn about a newborn, then a year after that to learn about a toddler, then another year to learn about two year olds and so on. There are some skills you can learn now that will help you tremendously when you become a parent even though they are not technically parenting skills: If you do all those things, you and your spouse will be interchangeable and can spell each other off doing urgent things when there just isn't enough time in the day. You'll be able to fight off sleep deprivation and remain calm when things are hard. You'll need that because they will be hard at times. They will also be wonderful too. For extra preparation, get right with money: In other words, make yourself financially stable. Not having the money for emergency car repairs and having to take the bus for a week until you get paid is the kind of thing that makes your life so much harder when you have a small child or when you're pregnant. "
What is the least problematic age difference between siblings?,"I'm 27 (and male); my two sisters are 25 and 16. I'm speaking from that experience, and from observation of other sibling-sets I've known well. Basically, I'd say that two kids who are close in age will be in constant interaction with each other, while kids who are farther apart will be more distant.  Closely-spaced kids move in similar fields and circles - they're likely to be in the same school in the same time; to demand attention in similar areas at the same time; to constantly compare themselves to each other. The huge pro here is that this gives them a constant companion; the huge con is that it can also give them a constant competitor.  I know I spent a lot of my childhood playing with my sister; we're very close, and have always been mercifully spared the typical sibling-rivalry issues. I've seen vast variety in terms of relationships between close siblings - everything from ""bestest buddies"" to ""oh, that guy?"" to ""grrr I will not sit in the same room with you."" I really don't think there's any way to predict where on the spectrum any particular group of siblings will fall - but I think that's the spectrum to be looking at. The more distantly-spaced the children are, the less this will be true. With a wide enough age gap, you'll have less of a ""close siblings"" relationship and more of a clearly imbalanced ""assistant caretaker"" relationship. This removes a ton of the potential conflict in childhood and teen years - but later on in life, these siblings might not feel as close to each other, or know how to relate well to them. I'm very close to both my sisters - but I was babysitting my younger sister through high-school, out of the house when she was in elementary school, and married before she turned 13. So even though in theory a 27-year old brother could have a close and evenly-balanced relationship with his 16-year old sister, and even though in just a couple of years we'll both be Semi-Responsible Adults, our relationship is informed by a ton of time when that wasn't the case. If what I'm saying here rings true to you, bear in mind that I'm talking about small gaps vs. big ones, rather than precise numbers. If you're debating between a 2 year gap or a 3 year gap, that's really not enough of a difference to base a choice on. If you're debating between a 2 year gap and a 5 year gap, then that's already a major difference. An easy trick would be this: choose some gaps that sound reasonable to you, and run along the line, figuring out how that gap is likely to affect the kids at every stage. For example, if Junior is born 3 years after Senior: ...and so on. You've got a whole slew of considerations; getting a sense of how each option would work out over time might help you choose the considerations that are most important to you. Remember also that the sibling dynamic is also heavily affected by the number of kids in the family; that should be considered as well. 2 siblings 2 years apart might be in a toss-up between ""best buddy"" and ""fierce rival"", but 5 siblings with 2-year-gaps between them might be a rambunctious gang - with more people and a wide range of ages, competition might be less of an issue, whereas getting attention and breathing space might become more pressing difficulties. Hope this helps :)"
Are modern cloth diapers really cost efficient compared to disposible diapers?,"Cloth diapering can be much more cost efficient than using disposables - including the cost of washing.   There are many types of modern cloth diapers, and the cost of diapering largely depends on the type of diaper chosen, as well as the brand of that diaper. Most types are sold with an organic option, which will also raise the price of the diaper. There are more expensive versions of BumGenius that are AIO and are made of organic cotton, these are called BumGenius Elemental.  Fitted diapers are likely the most expensive option, as they are sold for specific weight ranges and will not fit a baby from birth to potty-training as many of the others have One-size options. Many fitteds do not have a waterproof outer shell, and also require the use of a cover. The classic BumGenius diapers are a pocket diaper, and there are many cheaper options for pocket diapers, including but not limited to AlvaBaby, Sunbaby, and KaWaii. gDiapers are an example of a hybrid, and are the most expensive of the hybrid diapers available. A cheaper hybrid option is the Flip System (offered by the Cotton Babies brand who also make BumGenius diapers). Modern covers, such as the Thirsties Duo Wrap, allow for parents to use flats, prefolds, or fitteds very practically and for very little cost.  The most cost effective way to cloth diaper is to use flats, but those are certainly not a modern option. Prefolds are also an older diapering technology, but the new version of covers developed help to avoid the ""plastic pants"" that were so terrible 25-30 years ago.   (Also, the Snappi helps avoid sticking the parents and baby with pins, making prefolds and flats a truly modern option.) We have a toploading HE machine that allows me to turn off the HE option. I wash our diapers in a conventional amount of water (they are harder to get clean with less water), and our water bill has only gone up about $4 per month. Our electric bill hasn't noticeably changed. The biggest cost advantage for cloth diapering is seen when the diapers are used for a second or any concurrent children. For the second babies and beyond, you do not even see the upfront cost of purchasing the diapers. This allows a family to diaper a child for about $5-$10 a month which is significantly less than purchasing disposables."
Should a toddler who weaned only a few months ago be allowed to see mom nursing younger sibling?,"I'm not speaking from either personal experience (my children were all spaced farther apart) or from academic research in this answer. That being said: I think that ""hiding"" the breastfeeding will eventually end up making the toddler feel more isolated and excluded by her younger sibling. It will require specifically removing one sibling from another's presence (whether the older must leave the room, or her mother takes the newborn out of the room) as well as preventing the toddler from talking to or interacting with her mother at all. That seems more likely to result in loneliness or even resentment. Instead, invite the toddler to see what's going on. Talk about the differences that happen as you grow up (""you eat big girl food now!"") and invite her to bring her own snack or drink to sit near mom while the baby nurses. Make sure that you set some boundaries (the older sibling can't climb on or roughly hug while the baby is nursing, and may need to wait patiently for attention), but those are inevitable parts of being an older child (the same restrictions apply during diaper changes, for example)."
Should children be encouraged to get themselves or their clothes dirty?,"My initial reaction to this question is no, I do not believe that children should be encouraged to get themselves or their clothes dirty. As long as their aversion to dirt isn't interfering with the pursuit of safe/positive activities that they want to participate in. As humans we often participate in activities that lead to dirt and other grime by default - cooking, washing dishes, gardening, taking care of animals, swimming, going to the beach, cleaning the bathroom, etc. HOWEVER, we also promptly clean ourselves afterwards, because in most cases not doing so is a health concern. Overall, the desire to clean one's self after becoming dirty is a positive trait.  On the other hand, it does sound like this boy's aversion is strong enough that he is prevented from participation in some normal activities, and he definitely needs reinforcement of the idea that sometimes dirt happens, and that is completely ok - it's a normal part of life. But I think activities undertaken for the sole purpose of causing grime would be overkill, and send the wrong message. I would say choose activities with a purpose: if you want him to get dirt on his clothes, plant some vegetables with them. They'll love that anyway, especially if they get to harvest them later. If they're root vegetables, they'll have to dig them up when they've grown, so they get dirty twice :) if you want him to wipe his hands on his pants, take them camping and explain that pants are a fine alternative when you don't have the sink and towels you're used to; maybe easiest of all - if you want him to learn that mud is fun, take some pie pans out to the back yard and make mud pies. Whatever you choose to do, make sure that the dirtiness is a necessary side effect of the larger activity. Maybe take them to visit a farm and pet the animals.  It might also be that the boy's fear is about being able to get clean afterwards, and not knowing how to do it himself. So I think it would also be important to walk him through the clean-up process. Show him how to get the mud off his shoes (even if you do it for him), show him where the dirty clothes go, and help him take a bath if necessary.  My son is also very particular about dirt etc, and has been periodically brought to tears since the age of about 6 months if he didn't have a napkin to wipe his hands on at the table. Now that he has a good grasp of language though, he is easily reassured when I explain to him that (and how) we can clean up after a mess (""it's ok for your hands to get dirty, we'll just wash them in the sink when we're all done""), and when I explain to him that the dirt is just something that happens when you're doing fun things like riding horses and collecting chicken eggs, and we'll be able to wash his clothes and take a bath later. He loves making mud pies, and experiences very little anxiety about mess at this point - mostly only when he's overtired. "
How should a parent react when their child comes out of the closet to them?,"I found the suggestions on this website to be helpful: Be sure your child knows you love him or her.A parent’s first response
  should be to remind their child that you are there for them, and love
  them, and support them. “I love you, you’re my kid,”  Reaffirm your values. If you do not feel that teens should have sex with other
  teens, this is still your value, and you should still guide your child
  as their parent.  Get support. One of the best resources is Parents, Friends, and Families of Lesbians and Gays Protect your child. Because of the social stigma that homosexuality still carries,
  the risk of suicide in Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgendered youth 
  is much higher. Parents can  help by doing the same things they would
  do if their child was straight. Have a connection with them, find them
  support, make sure they are able to feel safe and loved in their home. If you believe that homosexuality is fundamentally wrong, then
  remember these other values: PFLAG (Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays) also has this advice: The first thing you should do for yourself and your loved one is to talk to someone who has been through this process. ... The second thing you should do is educate yourself.  ..."
How do you manage free time when you have kids?,"This is definitely primarily about you and your wife communicating, and (hopefully) compromising. However, since you asked about what a ""normal"" evening is like, I'll speak to that first. I'll start by saying I don't think there is a ""normal"".  Evening routing depends on so many factors, I can't imagine that you could single out any one and say that it is more common than the rest. I know some families where the parent who stays with the kid(s) during the day turns over all parental responsibilities once the spouse gets home from work, until the children are in bed. I know others where the opposite is true: the parent who cares for the children during the day also watches the children at night, to let the ""working"" spouse (""work"" in quotes because I won't even attempt to pretend that staying at home with a child all day is anything less than work) get some quiet time. Families where the children are in daycare, school, or stay with a caregiver other than either of the parents (i.e. grandparents, etc.) will likely have a very different routine. In my case, my wife and I both go to ""office jobs"" during the day, and my 2 year old goes to daycare.  I pick him up on the way home, and take care of him until dinner time (unless I'm cooking dinner, in which case my wife helps keep an eye on him while I cook). After dinner, one of three things happens, depending on the day.  Either all three of us spend time together as a family, I get my ""daddy evening"", or my wife gets her ""mommy evening"".   ""Mommy evening"" and ""daddy evening"" simply means that one night, one of us takes full responsibility until our son is in bed, and the other can do what he/she likes.  My wife reads, plays piano, or goes out with friends on those nights.  I play video games, or go to my ""man cave"" to work on my hobby.  However it works out, we try to make sure that we each get at least one night where we don't have to entertain our son all night. After my son goes to bed, we usually have about an hour or so to watch TV or read before we go to bed. Maybe an arrangement like this might work for you and your wife, but you have to talk first. Perhaps one of the best pieces of advice I've gotten about having discussions like this is to avoid phrasing things around ""you"".  Instead, focus on ""I"".  For example, instead of saying ""All you want to do is sit on the couch, watch TV, and fall asleep"", saying ""I don't want to spend all my free time sitting on the couch, and watching TV until we fall asleep.""  It comes across as far less confrontational that way. Communicate what you want, but be sure to make clear that you also want to know what your wife wants.  The reality is that neither of you are very likely to get exactly what you want, but a good compromise will leave you both feeling like you're at least getting what you need."
How do you convince your son to poop in the toilet?,"A possible less-than-orthodox answer, provided you did all the standard advice already (e.g. usual behavior modification tricks and avoid hard/constipated stools as another answer mentioned). He may have a problem with the water splashing on him when the poop hits the water. Ours had issues with pooping on the toilet, but once they were resolved he started doing it... and then stopped and hated it. After a month of trying other things, I asked him if that was the problem. He said ""yes"". I told him I can show him how to fix, put a piece of toilet paper on top of the water, demonstrated that a piece of bread would splash when dropped on water bbut not splash when falling on paper.  BINGO. He had no issues from that day. As an extra treat, when he was good he'd be permitted to tear off and put in the paper himself."
How do you know when it is time to take a child to the Doctor?,"A good pediatrician should have an on-call service 24/7 - or there should be some type of hotline or service you can call, organized by the local governement, your health care provider or similar. First time parents especially may not always know when it's serious and when it's not. A good pediatrician (and nursing staff) also will say that you should at least call in rather than not. When in doubt, err on the side of caution! You may not need to take the child to the doctor, but one call can reduce concern. It is entirely justified to say that one of the roles of a pediatrician is to make the parents feel better, too. Call in more often than not.  Remember, even if your child is not sick, it is not ""wasting the doctor's time"" to call and ask. Also, you can ask your doctor when they think you should call them. It is a question they are very used to hearing, and they will give you guidelines. Go to the doctor when: Don't hesitate; it's okay. In the course of several visits, you'll gain more experience to evaluate which of the above 3 you're facing, and the last one will become rarer. Specific symptoms that are good signs to contact the doctor are: Changes in appetite (refuses several feedings in a row or eats poorly. Changes in mood (lethargic, unusually difficult to rouse, persistently irritable,or inconsolable crying). Tender navel or penis (umbilical area or penis suddenly becomes red or starts to ooze or bleed). Fever. ANY fever if younger than age 3 months, 3 months or older an oral temperature of 102 F (38.9 C) or higher, give your baby acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) and contact doctor if the fever doesn't respond to the medication or lasts longer than one day or is unusually irritable, lethargic or uncomfortable. Diarrhea (especially loose or watery stools.) Vomiting or spiting up large portions of multiple feedings or vomits forcefully after feedings. Dehydration (if baby doesn't wet a diaper for six hours or longer, the soft spot on top of your baby's head seems to sink, or your baby cries without tears or has a dry mouth without saliva). Constipation (fewer bowel movements than usual for a few days) Colds that interfere with his or her breathing, lasts longer than two weeks, or is accompanied by severe coughing. Ear trouble (baby doesn't respond normally to sounds or has fluid draining from his or her ears). Rash (covering a large area, appears infected or sudden unexplained rash — especially if the rash is accompanied by a fever). Eye discharge (one or both eyes are pink, red or leaking mucus). Excessive bruising Seek emergency care for: Bleeding that can't be stopped Poisoning Fits, convulsions or seizures Trouble breathing, fast breathing, grunting while breathing, or if your child is working hard to breathe, for example, sucking their stomach in under their ribs Head injuries A sudden lack of energy or inability to move Unresponsiveness, reduction in activity or increased floppiness Large cuts or burns Neck stiffness Blood in the urine, bloody diarrhea or persistent diarrhea Skin or lips that look blue, purple, gray, very pale, mottled or ashen a high-pitched, weak or continuous cry in babies, a bulging fontanelle (the soft spot on a baby's head) not drinking for more than eight hours (taking solid food is not as important) a high temperature, but cold feet and hands a high temperature coupled with quietness and listlessness your baby or child is unusually drowsy, hard to wake up or doesn’t seem to know you your child is unable to stay awake even when you wake them a spotty, purple-red rash anywhere on the body. (This could be a sign of meningitis) repeated vomiting or bile-stained (green) vomiting Specific advice regarding temperatures: If you're worried speak to your General Practitioner (or, in the UK, call NHS Direct on 0845 4647). If the surgery is closed, contact your GP out-of-hours service. If you're still concerned, or if your GP or out-of-hours service can’t come quickly enough, take your child straight to the Accident and Emergency (A&E) department of your nearest hospital. Always contact your GP, health visitor, practice nurse or nurse practitioner if: Additional Thoughts: If you're asking on the Internet, you should be asking the doctor or nurse. If you wonder if you should bring your baby in for a visit, then you should. If you have 1 question, at least call the doctor's office. If you have more than 2 questions, set up a consultation so you're not bombarding the doctor over the phone and have more time for follow-ups and note-taking. If you have any questions, it helps to bring a notepad with questions written down in advance and write the answers. If the doctor doesn't take you and your questions seriously, then it's time to find a new practice. People can give you general advice, but none of us have access to your baby's medical chart, and general advice may not work for some children for subtle reasons. For example: my baby had severe diaper rash. Ordinarily diaper rash isn't too much to worry about, and if I'd asked about it online, I think I would have gotten a lot of answers that consider it part of being a baby. But I have a strong family history of allergies, and my baby's diaper rash turned out to be the result of a milk allergy. We figured it out between my husband's and my observations, my parents supplying info about my medical history, and the doctor's expertise. No one on the internet would have been able to confirm it, even if they might have raised the red flag. Sources: Mayo Clinic NHS Choices - Temperature NHS Choices - Symptoms Pediatrics.about.com"
Is it okay for both parents to be asleep at the same time?,"Yes, it's okay for both parents to sleep at the same time, for several reasons.  The human mind is finely tuned to the sound of crying babies, you'll be surprised at what you can hear subconsciously while you sleep. Our pediatrician wisely commented that newborns have only one desire - to grow older - so you can be sure they'll tell you if something is bothering them enough. Another reason to sleep together is that parents need to take care of each other too. If you always put the baby first, then you'll burn out. You can only care for the baby when you're adequately reasonably sort of rested and balanced. The only situation where ""keeping watch"" might be sensible is if you're very worried about SIDS. The problem is that ""sudden"" really means ""science has no idea what causes this and there seem to be no symptoms"", so nobody can say if this child is more/less at risk. For parents that are worried specifically about SIDS there are products like Angel Care but mostly you've just got to accept that you can't prevent some things. 
Also, as KennyPeanuts points out, SIDS is very rare and often misunderstood to include suffocation from objects (teddys, pillows, blankets) so be sure to have a safe crib those first few months."
How to help a child accept when an activity is over,"Give the child an advance warning about the upcoming transition (as mentioned in the answer by Roger Vadim), perhaps even several advance warnings. For example: ""We will need to go home in 10 minutes"", then: ""Remember that we are leaving in two minutes, so please start picking up your toys"". Children do not like when they have to suddenly stop doing something that they enjoy. Speak in a calm voice and be polite. Say ""please"", etc. Harsh and impolite language are poor antecedents. Praise the child when they transition without a tantrum or with a milder than usual tantrum. Praise should be specific, immediate and enthusiastic. You should be close to the child when you praise them, plus use touch. Praise even baby steps towards the desired goal, in your case, a transition without a tantrum. If the desired behavior (see the above point) does not occur naturally at all, use games and simulations. Play a game with the child where they first pretend to do something and then they pretend to switch to something else. When they do the ""pretend transition"" without a tantrum, praise them. Repeat the game a few times per day for multiple days. SEE ALSO: REFERENCES: Alan E. Kazdin and Carlo Rotella, The Everyday Parenting Toolkit: The Kazdin Method for Easy, Step-by-Step, Lasting Change for You and Your Child. New York: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2013. This book has a lot of advice on handling tantrums in many common situations, and provides much more details than is possible to give on a Q&A site, for example: As you can probably tell, the “please” matters a great deal—both because it conveys a sense of choice to a child and because it serves to control your own tone. It’s harder to yell and speak harshly when you begin with “please.” Choice, a warm tone, and politeness all help to produce the results you want, as I’ll explain when I tell you about other sorts of antecedents. (p. 33) The program [simulation] would be repeated the next day, and the next; the child should have many opportunities within a fairly brief time. At the Parenting Center, we recommend at least a couple of such prompted trials per day, but there is no research to support any particular number and we have worked with parents whose schedules restricted them to just one per day. The general rule is: the more practice opportunities and trials in which behavior can occur and be reinforced, the better. (p. 104) After the simulations begin, there are likely to be unprompted occasions when the child does not have a tantrum or has a low-magnitude tantrum (a little whining). That is, the simulations also affect behavior in nonsimulated conditions. You should enthusiastically praise these unprompted mild or milder-than-usual tantrums outside of the Tantrum Game the first few times they occur. The effect of this is to greatly increase the likelihood of milder real-life tantrums. Yet the key to getting this behavior is several practice trials in simulated circumstances. (p. 105)"
What is a reasonable amount of time to wait before family visits your new baby?,"If you're having to describe this process as a ""negotiation"" then I get the impression that relations between your family and your parents/in-laws aren't always the most hospitable.  Perhaps I'm reading more into the word than was intended.  Are they the types of people who tend to over-stay their welcome?  Show up unannounced?  Have unreasonable expectations of you and your wife when they come to visit?   Before you have these conversations with your families, make sure that your wife and yourself are absolutely on the same page, and agree that changes can be made after baby arrives if necessary.  Sure, it sounds like a good idea to say ""No visitors until baby is 1 month old"" until you get to week three of no sleep.  Suddenly, having someone who could watch the baby for two hours so you can grab a cat-nap sounds like the best thing in the world.  And you can have different rules for different family members.  She might want her mom around more during the first few weeks than she wants your mom around.  Or vice versa.  As previous posters have pointed out, any ""routine"" you have within the first month is going to be tenuous at best on a good day, and the second month improves somewhat.  There will be days when baby sleeps most of the day and wakes only to eat and go right back to sleep and then is up most of the night.  There will be cluster feedings.  There will be days when baby is surprisingly alert during the day and sleeps pretty great at night.  And about the time you think you have a routine, something happens to disrupt it.  Parenting, in general, is all about having a general routine and then working around the disruptions. So I guess it's more a question of whose routine you are more concerned about disrupting?  You will more easily fall into a routine than your child will, and, for the most part, that routine will revolve around responding to what your child needs when he/she needs it.  In this case, it doesn't matter who's present.  When baby needs to eat, he/she needs to eat.  Or have a diaper change.  Or sleep.  But the likelihood of a visitor disrupting a baby's non-existent schedule is slim in the first month to two months of life.   Barring any of the things I mentioned in the first paragraph (over-stayed welcome/unannounced visits/unreasonable expectations), and assuming that everything is going all right with feeding (I'm assuming your wife is going to try to breastfeed, if she isn't then that's a different situation), then sometimes it's easier to gird your loins and just get it over with quickly (like, within 2 weeks).  Certainly with the grandparents at least.  Just because you allow close family over does not mean you have to allow the whole neighborhood in.  Remember that, for the most part, these people care about you, are happy for you, and probably want to help you in whatever way they can.  Surround yourself with the caring, loving people and disregard the malicious ones as best you can.  And remember:  YOU are the parent.  YOU call the shots.  If it's a bad day and you'd rather not have visitors, then don't accept visitors.  No rules are set in stone unless you make them so."
What would be a effective way to explain pornography?,"My immediate thought is that a sex movie is like any other movie:
It's fake and make-believe, created only to provide entertainment to the viewer. Take Notting Hill as an example. Just like in any other movie, the actors are paid to follow a script. They must perform actions and pretend to have emotions and reactions. Just because it looks real in the movie does not mean that it is real: for instance, you can be quite sure that there is no real love involved, it's just make-believe.  Being an actor is quite simply a profession. It doesn't matter what the movie is about; it's just fiction. Some people like epic fantasy movies and other people like war movies or cartoons. Some people like sex movies, and pornography is made for them You don't have to like porn, but you don't have to hate those folks either."
Why do kids always do things which we tell them NOT to do?,"I'm not a psychologist, but I've often heard, that from psychological point of view the ""No"" or negation in the heard words is subconsciously overheard, so if you tell you child ""don't hold the knife"", what passes through to its brain is only ""hold the knife"". (I think I read that e. g. in the book ""The Secret of Happy Children"" by Steve Biddulph) The solution is to use positive expressions instead of negative ones.
This is often difficult and sometimes seems impossible to me, but very often it works:  I also heard about this kind of ""positive"" programming when talking to yourself (loudly or ""in your head""):
e. g. if your driving your car and you are tired 
and you tell yourself ""Don't get off the road!"", you will more likely really get off the road than if you tell yourself ""stay on the road!"""
"At what age should a child stop accompanying a parent into the ""wrong"" public toilet?","Aside from your comfort with the location and requirement to ensure to their personal safety, as soon as they don't need help toileting and washing their hands. This could be as early as 3 or 4, or as late as 6 or 7, or later depending on the location. As children approach puberty, mixed bathrooms become less appropriate. I avoid this awkwardness by using family washrooms or special needs facilities where available."
Ways to convince a teenager to quit smoking,"Different kids need to hear different messages. Many of the tactics, stratagems, and talking points that work on younger kids or non-smokers simply will not work if you are dealing with an older teen who already smokes (e.g. kissing a smoker is like kissing an ashtray). Some of what I'm about to suggest may actually be counterproductive for a non-smoker to hear. It boils down to this: BUT I'm sure she already knows that, but you or your mother need to have a talk with her. Encourage her to talk through some of her thoughts and feelings. What is the appeal for her? While discussing, don't deny her feelings and experiences. If she says she likes the taste, don't tell her nobody could possibly like the taste. If she says it calms her down, don't deny it. Smoking is a hell of a way to meet people, especially important during a time when hormones are racing. The shared ritual in the smokepit is the ultimate icebreaker. Figure out which qualities are important to her before proceeding. This helps you build trust and anticipate challenges. This is where you lay out the facts: long-term smoking is incredibly damaging to health in a wide variety of ways. Even if she already knows (or professes to know), don't skip this step entirely. Smoking has profound affects on each of the following: hair, skin, taste/tongue, teeth, voice, athletic performance, COPD, cancer, etc. Don't take a deterministic view (i.e. don't say smoking will absolutely give you cancer); any given smoker will probably not experience diminution in all of those areas, but pretty much every smoker will be affected in some of those ways. Teenagers have a wonderful ability to engage in magical thinking; the point of this step is to strip away the idea that it can't happen to me. By this point, she'll probably admit that she doesn't intend to smoke forever, it's just something she's doing now that she'll probably quit later. Truth bomb: quitting smoking is crazy hard because it is both psychologically comforting and chemically addictive. The longer you smoke, the harder it is to stop. Ask her if she feels stress relief when she smokes. If she has, ask her if she thinks that is because smoking is genuinely stress relieving or if she is merely satisfying a chemical craving. Let her be honest. If she hasn't experienced cravings yet, tell her that's good news because it may be easier to quit. The point is to get her to conclude for herself that quitting is difficult and that she is becoming pysiologicically addicted regardless of her intentions. If she denies this, you may have to go into more depth with testimonials or stories from people she knows (maybe even her own friends who are already struggling with quitting). Hopefully she's now ready to accept the fact that she should quit, but this is where you encourage her to quit now (again: the longer you wait, the harder it is). In light of all the things discussed in part 1, ask her what kind of replacement behaviors and habits she'll need to develop to compensate. In light of part 3, ask her what kind of strategies she can use to combat the chemical side of addiction. Let her know that even with replacements, it will be hard. There are many different strategies and tools, all of which work for differently for different people. The key is to recognize that a variety of strategies should be employed and she should be willing to swap out techniques that are not working. Tell her she can ask for support, then support her when she asks. Good luck in your efforts to help her, and good luck to her in her effort to kick the habit."
Should adults pay rent if they live in their parents' home?,"There are two possible extremes here--demanding rent as soon as they turn 18 years old, or allowing them to stay for free indefinitely regardless of their social, educational, or vocational status. I assume most of us will agree that the best answer is somewhere between these extremes, but determining exactly where isn't easy. And because family and individual situations are different, there is no ""best solution"" that is best in all cases. As long as staying at home is not preventing the child from progressing socially, educationally, and/or vocationally, I see no problem with them staying for free. If they just graduated and got a new job or just started going to school, staying at home (for free) can be a great way for them to save up for future financial independence. On the other hand, if they're not taking advantage of that opportunity to save and prepare, staying at home for free is a hindrance to them. So there is not a set age or social status that defines when a child should be required to pay rent (or even be allowed to stay at home any more). Make sure your child know what you expect of them in terms of their financial independence, and make sure you understand their expectations as well. Set some goals and guidelines and then determine how strict you will need to be with those guidelines. As others have mentioned, a lot of this comes down to communication."
(How) do you explain a 3 year-old that he has to stay at his grand-ma for longer than anticipated?,"Just be straightforward. Tell him what will happen and why in whatever way you feel makes sense to him. Then ask open ended questions to check in on whether he understands (or not) and what his emotional reactions are. Many kids are very comfortable with grandparents. There is a good chance that he'll be totally fine with with, ""Mommy and Daddy are sick. You will stay a few days with Grandma A, and then with Grandpa B, and then come home"". If that upsets him in some way, you will need to talk it through. Figure out why he is upset and then figure out together what can alleviate his concerns. You may get to a point where you just have to go with ""I understand that you don't like it, but that's what needs to happen"". Most three-year olds are perfectly fine with that approach."
Should I have the same bedtime as my sister?,"I'm going to interpret the question as asking how a parent can manage the bedtimes of siblings of different ages, as I think that's a great question, and answerable (as opposed to asking for an opinion). I have two children, and not only are they of different ages (though closer, a year and a half apart), but the younger one naturally needs more sleep than the older even age-for-age.  What's more, the younger one wants to sleep with the older one (in the same bedroom, often!), and definitely wants to go to sleep at the same time - it is ""unfair"" if the older one goes later, and on top of that it's just impractical given they (voluntarily, on both parts) share a room. There's issues here on both sides, that I think can be balanced - but you have to understand them both.  For the younger, it seems unfair that the older child should go to bed later, even though they probably do need a little less sleep.  For the older, it is unfair to have to go to bed at the same time as a much younger child when all of their friends are going to bed later. How we work on this is twofold.  First, we do technically have ""different"" bedtimes de jure, though they aren't different de facto - meaning, officially the younger has lights off at 8:30pm and the older has lights off at 9:00pm, but realistically they both go to bed at the same time.  Lights off for us means the e-readers turn off at that time; but we allow the younger to extend his time to 9 if he asks politely.  This is not just us being ""say please before we do something"" - it's actually a test: is he overtired?  If he is, then he won't be able to ask politely. Second, we allow them to wake up when they want - and so the older one wakes up earlier.  If he really is getting enough sleep, then he'll wake up on his own earlier - and then we allow him to do ""fun"" things in the morning, once he's gotten ready for school.  Wake up, get dressed, make lunch, do morning chores, and get breakfast; after that's done, he's allowed to play on his screens until a little while before school.  That ""makes up"" for the perhaps slightly earlier bedtime - because he wouldn't be allowed to play games that late in the day anyway. I suspect as a kid this answer doesn't really hit all of the points you'd hope for, but I would encourage you to think of things from both sides here - it will help you make your case for change.  Balancing things like this, when both kids have a reasonable argument, is hard - both for parents and, well, everyone else.  Having kids go to bed at different times who share a room is very difficult, because bedtime is the time where you have the least self control.  This is true for adults, also - ask anyone who's trying to lose weight when they're most likely to have snacks, the answer is probably late at night.  So your younger sister will have a much harder time being reasonable, even if it is entirely reasonable to tell her that she just has to go to bed earlier, just because it's late and it's hard to think rationally when you're tired!  So, parents have to find compromises - and sometimes the compromise is something nobody really wants. (That's how you can tell it's a good compromise - if nobody's happy...) The key to finding a solution that does make you happy, if the above answer doesn't work for you or your parents, is finding something that will actually work, and making the suggestion for how to make it work - and making sure it works for both parties.  Not just it ""should"" be fair, but that your sister actually thinks it is fair and is willing to do it.  If you want to go to bed an hour later, what can you do to help your sister feel that it's fair?  Find out what she wants, and see if you can come up with something that works - and that isn't going to require more work from your parents.  Parents (and anyone in charge of anything) tend to be very positive about changes that don't require them to listen to complaining or do anything extra!"
Is walking barefoot bad for my child's health?,"The reason being barefoot is linked to sickness is two things: people link being cold to getting a cold; and people see kids in developing countries and more rural locations in their own country barefoot and more often sick.  In the former case,  while being VERY cold for a prolonged time can lead to weakening your immune system, but the reason we get colds in the winter is primarily the dry air, not being cold.  In the latter case, it's the lack of nutrition and medical care that results in the sickness - not walking barefoot."
Teaching a 7yo responsibility for his choices,"Sounds to me that you are teaching him responsibility for his choices.  You let him make a choice, and then let him bear the consequences of that choice. It won't be instant that he stops complaining and pointing to you - he's spent years where everything was someone else's choice, so that's just human nature.  But as long as you gently remind him he had a choice of what to do, and this is what happens based on that choice, he'll get there. I like to talk to my children about their choices afterwards, and talk about it in the mindset of ""what would or could we do differently next time"".  Think ""growth mindset"" here - no criticisms for the choice, there is no wrong choice; just what do they think they'd prefer to do differently.  And no ""I told you so"" - reminders that there was a choice, but not accusations they should've listened. Not this: Ow!  My foot hurts! Why did you take me to that splash pad? It was too hot! I told you to wear your water shoes, now you see why! You shouldn't have taken me when it was hot, it's your fault. See how that immediately falls into ""your fault""?  It's not him doing the blaming - it's you, first.  Instead, do this: Ow!  My foot hurts! Why did you take me to that splash pad? It was too hot! Oh, that's unfortunate! What do you think we can do next time to avoid getting hurt feet? I don't know, it just hurts! What do you think about your choice to not wear water shoes?  Do you think a different choice there might have changed the outcome here? I don't know, maybe? And then they're thinking about it.  They might still blame you or yell or whatever; it's partially them expressing their feelings, and partially because they hold you as the all-seeing-all-powerful-parent, and so everything must be your fault.  Getting away from that, and training them to think about how they respond to things - particularly after the fact - helps a lot there."
How damaging is it for children to witness their parent's sexual activity?,"I think it depends more on the attitude of the parents and the child's disposition and age than on the actual witnessing (and maybe, how kinky things were when the viewing took place).  I didn't find any online aricles with a scientific study on the matter or anything (how would you even go about a study like that really?) but I did find This article which goes into a little more detail than I do here. My parents were always very open about things with me so when, on my twelth birthday a friend and I accidentally came across two adults in the act on the dock at the local swimming hole where I was about to have my party.  Mom knew just from looking at me that I'd seen something and simply said, ""You've just seen a matched pair haven't you?""  She didn't even bat an eyelash about it, just very matter-of-fact almost as though every kid runs into such a moment eventually.  Dad went and warned the couple (who were just the other side of the trees from where the picnic tables were) that there was about to be twenty some odd pre-teen girls arriving so they might enjoy another location more while mom simply followed up her first statement with, ""any questions?""  I think she must have called the other girl's mom during the party to let my friend's mom know what we had seen, but I don't remember her making a big deal about it at all. When my sister and I stumbled on some old nudie pics dad had of mom (which I'll grant you is not the same thing as seeing them in the act), I laughed about the matter.  My sister (three years younger and much shier by nature) was totally grossed out, but niether of us were traumatized and it is sort of a family joke now.   On the other hand, my husband's family rarely discussed sex at all.  So, when my youngest sister-in-law walked into her parent's house at the age of 20 and heard ""noises"" she dropped her bags, turned and ran from the house and spent the night at a friend's.  She is still freaked out enough by the whole thing that if her siblings bring it up she goes cherry red and pretty much clams up for the rest of the time we are together despite the fact that she didn't actually see anything and she was already sexually active herself.  My mother-in-law apparently hasn't figured out why this daughter's bags arrived before the daughter herself (yea right). So here is what I suggest: Kids will be grossed out (at least a little) because it is only natural to want to think of your parents as sexless beings who just happen to be the only people who ever actually got a delivery (or deliveries) from the stork.  I just don't think it has to be traumatizing unless you treat it as if it is. http://www.nbcnews.com/id/25936129/ also had some related info as did CNN: http://www.cnn.com/2013/04/24/health/kerner-kids-sex/ This question is about how to go about having the post- ""whoops"" moment talk with a teen."
Autistic child constantly mobbed by other children - what can be done?,"Very difficult subject... It's the most effective, and the point you have the most impact on. It sounds possible zen and overreaching, but the child need inner-strength, and, above all, inner-peace. It's going to be very difficult, but someone would need to help the child to be more passive about the assaults and not show an emotional reaction towards them. Obviously difficult in the general case, and even harder here, I know. And at the same time, the child will need to learn to resist them as non-aggressively as possible. It doesn't mean fighting back, it doesn't mean responding in kind, it means making it less easy. It's very hard and sad to say, but it's about making it less fun and more difficult for the attackers. I'd also think that if these things are routine enough and happen within your (or anyone's) sight, it's your responsibility to walk up to these kids and try to talk to them. As mentioned by w00t in his answer, they do it for the sense of belonging to a group, so it's a difficult dynamic to break. But it's quite likely some of these kids have someone in their close or remote family circles that have disabilities and that they wouldn't them to be picked on. They also wouldn't want any of that to happen to these relatives or themselves, disabilities or not. If you can get them to imagine what it would be like to live in the other child's shoes, if only for one day, it will it home. It won't be enough to beat group-effect in most cases, sadly, but it's a step in the right direction. Change one at a time. However, you can't handle other people's kids, and it means there are other people who need to get involved. Their parents, their teachers, or other educators or authoritative figures they look up to. I'd even recommend to go as far as to talk to educators and collaborate with them to build sessions to raise awareness, if that's what it takes. You will turn some around, and these will then be helpful forces in preventing the more die-hard bullies from keeping at it. Organize a presentation at school on the topic. Invite kids to a home or bring someone with experience to talk about the issue - and make sure the kids actually talk to this person, not the other way around, as they'll be force to create a bond. Maybe screen videos about the impacts of bullying on the life of people with these problems. These usually don't let people flat out cold. They may pretend to laugh about it and snicker while in groups, but they'll definitely get something out of it. It's also probably a good thing to make them understand that their actions can have consequences. Not just for the kid, but for themselves, as the child and the parents could press charges, and while it's fair to assume the bullies are juvenile they will still have some degree of obvious discomfort in that process."
How do you address sibling rivalry?,"If things are escalating to the point of physical altercation, you've already waited too long to intervene. Don't ""wait until it gets bad enough"" -- that's how kids come to think the rules don't really matter.  When you see an infraction, give a calm but stern warning.   Finally, all siblings bicker to some degree.  To be close as adults, they don't need to be conflict-free now.  Focus on ending the behavior that is disruptive (preferably before it becomes violent) and teaching your kids better way to resolve the conflicts that will eventually crop up."
How do you determine when to start a child on music lessons without pressuring them?,"""Too early"" depends very much on the child. My wife started banging on the family piano when she was five, until her mother finally convinced a teacher to give her lessons (normally the teacher did not give lessons to children under 6).  Since she had an active interest that she expressed without prompting from her parents, I'd say that 5 was not too early for her to start. ""Pressuring"" depends also on the child.  So long as you are going at a pace and establishing a disciplined schedule that does not interfere with your son's enjoyment, then it is safe to say you are not pressuring him.  The danger of pressuring a child is that you run the risk of removing their enjoyment.  For them to be successful at music (however you choose to define it), they will have to enjoy playing for their entire lives.  If they start off by dreading lessons, practice, and the pressure that goes with them, then their enjoyment will be stunted, if not altogether destroyed. The other component to consider is pace.  Generally speaking, a 5-year-old will learn at a different pace than a 10 year old, largely due to the developmental gap in motor skills.  So long as you are careful to make sure the pace of the lessons and practice don't exceed their capabilities, you should be okay.  If it becomes a struggle to get him to practice every day, consider cutting down on the practice sessions a bit until he's older.   But so long as he enjoys playing, and shows enthusiasm for practice, I wouldn't worry at all that you're going too early, or putting too much pressure on him."
How do you potty train for overnight?,"Our kids were ""night trained"" by the time they were about 4. If you can figure out when they are having their accidents, it makes it easier to help them. Here are my recommendations: First, get a plastic sheet; there are going to be accidents. Second, don't use pull-ups. Help her feel like a big girl so the accidents matter. Then, make the last drink at dinnertime. Be sure they go to the bathroom before bed. And get them to use the toilet before you go to bed and first thing as soon as you get up."
Should we tell our children that we 'spy' on them? When should we stop 'spying' on them?,"My first answer would be...it doesn't matter too much. By that I mean that there is allot of advice that could be given and different options, but for the most part I don't think the child's development or growth is going to be drastically changed by any of these options, so long as camera is not used to invade an expectation or privacy, leaving it running when he is 8 or something (see below). Having said that here is my general advice, make of it what you will. First, I would tell him about what your doing now in as much detail as he can understand, and continue to reference the camera often enough that he grows use to the idea, for a few reasons. The third option is the big one I would focus on.  Sure at 2 he doesn't really have an expectation of privacy, particularly when in his playroom; but that expectation needs to develop.  You don't want him at age 4 to think your still watching him when he uses the restroom (yes an exaggeration here, but you get the point).  Since at some point your need to define this boundary I think the easiest way is to make it explicit from day one, long before it matters, so it doesn't become an issue when it does start to matter. Tell him he can go play in his playroom and your turn on the camera, but also let him know that you turn it off when he comes out for lunch or before bed etc.  You don't really need to stress when it goes off, just tell him when it turns on and he will figure out that must mean it's off otherwise. This sets early on the expectation of privacy, that your only watching when you tell him your watching, and that the room is still his and private other times. As an added bonus by telling him your watching at some times he may feel more involved with you even when your busy out in the kitchen.  He can say ""mommy look"" and hold up something he drew to the camera and you can look at it.  He can know your watching him build that big tower etc.  By making it clear when you are watching he may still get a bit of the advantage of ""social time"" with his parents even while in a different room; particularly if you talk some while he is in his room.  Perhaps even throw in a baby monitor so you can easier talk with him without shouting.  This could be a good way to keep him feeling like your involved even when you need to do other things. I do think that the expectation of privacy aspect is important though.  Yes your child is still really young, but ground rules early are easier to grow into.  If he learns that the camera is off unless otherwise told now, when he is too young to care if your watching, then by the time he is a little older and just beginning to get a feel for a desire for privacy you can have the camera without imposing on that development. While even less of a ""must do"" then the rest I personally would remove it sooner rather then later.  At his current age being able to keep an eye on him is nice.  However, as he gets older you can safely leave him to run around the house without feeling the need to keep an eye on him.  As soon as you find yourself not feeling the need/desire to watch the camera I would remove it, since it's not needed.   In fact I would go so far as to consider making that something of an idea/option for him.  Tell him he is a big boy and you don't think you need the camera any more, does he want you to remove it.  Maybe he will come to value being able to play in his room and still have you around to interact with and will want to keep it.  More likely by the time your ready to remove it he will have no qualm with it going; but you can use it as a ""your a big boy, we don't need to watch you because we trust you"" moment anyways.  I like to give kids these moments of reminding them they are getting older and more responsible, it makes them feel good.  You can even tie it in with ""now were trusting you, make sure you earn that trust by being good"" or something along those lines; so long as you don't make a threat of adding the camera back in if their not good lightly. Edit: You asked about impact of 'spying', which I didn't address yet.  First, at age 2 there is little impact.  At this age the children expect you to be omnipotent so your being a little closer to that ideal then most isn't going to do any real harm,  At most it risks confirming the child's elevated views of your knowing everything which could cause some minor confusion; thus my second point about avoiding such unrealistic expectations, but this isn't too major.  I don't think it does much harm right now. Having said that, I don't think it does a massive amount of good either, unless the child likes interacting with you through the camera once he knows about you.  In general he is unlikely to do anything truly dangerous without your being aware of it even without the camera, most parent's dont have it and kids don't seem to be setting fires or anything.  Mostly what you would be stopping is annoyances, like his making messes you would need to clean up or breaking something by mistake; and even that won't happen most of the time. In terms of stopping annoyances, that's nice for you.  However, some mistakes are best made to learn from them.  If he makes a mess and only later gets yelled at to clean it up; well that can be as much of a learning oppertunity as being warned not to make the mess to start with, possible even more of one since it let him make a decision and then see direct consequences from it rather then having the decision made ahead of time. In the end I think it all evens out.  The camera is mostly about the parents peace of mind of knowing for certain the child isn't getting in trouble, and stopping trouble they don't want to clean up.  It doesn't do much harm to not have it, but it doesn't do much harm to have it either, so it seems the covenience of catching a few of those messes ahead of time and, more significantly, your own peace of mind of knowing he is fine when he was suspiciously quite for awhile, is worth having. What age to remove it is a little more complicated, since this gets into emotional development in many ways.  I would say the moment he starts to dislike the camera; not in a ""mommy just caught me being bad"" way but in a more general ""do I really need that?"" sort of way it may be time to get rid of it.  I'm personally a believer that kids are more capable then we often give them credit for and as such should be given more freedom to make decisions and learn from their mistakes.  As such I personally would err on the side of removing the camera sooner, to give a child freedom.  This is actually less about privacy, and more of...agency?  Giving the child an oppertunity to feel they can make their own decisions, and mistakes, without their expecting their parents to be watching them and fixing everything. Having said that there is allot of flexibility here in terms of age.  besides, as I alrady said, I think the difference is pretty minor either way.  Rather then giving you a set age I would say it's time to seriously consider removing when"
What are these? Received from children's centre in free pack,Those look like something for wrapping up and securing draw cords on blinds.  You would wrap the cord between the diamond shaped piece and the long piece.  You can then insert the cord into the holes in the diamond piece to keep it from coming unraveled.  This way you can shorten the strings so kids can't choke themselves on it.
My son refuses to celebrate. What should parents do?,"I don't know what culture you are coming from, but in the U.S., a birthday celebration is for the celebrant more than it is for the attendees.  From that point of view, it would be pretty lousy to force/coerce/argue your son into attending a celebration that he is fundamentally not interested in.  As parents, you have the responsibility to ask your son to do necessary things he does not want to do (e.g going to the dentist).  A celebration is not a necessary thing. That said, I would suggest a few things. Understand what your son objects to.  Is it any celebration?  Would a quick private celebration be OK with him, but not a big to-do with lots of guests?  Ask, then listen. If you and your son find no way to have a celebration that is acceptable to all of you, then don't have one.  It's that simple. Your son is at the age where he's going to be learning how to be an autonomous person whose own needs and rights matter.  If you force him to do something that is not necessary and that he does not want to do, you will be sending a powerful message to him, that his needs are not as important as the needs of people who have power over him.  You may get what you want now, but it may not be a good lesson for him later, when he's out in the world and advocating for himself in matters of importance."
My daughter just turned 13 and confides in me she wants to be a boy [duplicate],"You bring up many points that show that your relationship with your kid is not the best at the moment. But I'd like to focus on your kid presumably being trans. Yes, there are more people openly living trans these days than ten or twenty years before, especially in the younger generation. But this doesn't invalidate these trans identities. It's just like gays and lesbians in the 1980s and 1990s: Growing acceptance leads to more visibility, more people coming out of the closet. I cannot talk about your kid, but in most cases people - kids and adults - take a long time before coming out. It may appear as a sudden development to outsiders (which includes parents in this case), but the sudden development isn't the being trans, it's the coming out. Maybe it's only a phase, but you shouldn't hold your breath. The important thing is, that you are there for your kid, and there are a number of things, that are important: I don't know where your come from, so I don't know the legal and medical rules, but in general: The first step normally is social transitioning (living in your new identity) and in your case (at the or after the onset of puberty) puberty blockers. Both are completely reversible. When the time comes for testosterone, you will know if it's been a phase, this isn't your problem right now. And in many jurisdictions surgeries will be done only on adults or - depending on the country - much older juveniles who have shown that they know what they are consenting in. Selected sources"
Daughters refusing to go home with my ex their mother,"Your priority has to be the safety of your children. They are not safe living with their Mom. So if at all possible you need to get them moved in with you. You don't say what kind of a place you now have, and whether that is feasible. But even sleeping bags on the floor would be an improvement on where they are now. It would also be a good idea to have a talk with them (if you haven't already) about good and bad touches, what the right words are, and what to do if someone tries to touch them in a bad way. Horrible that you have to do this, but it sounds like they might need to know."
What is the impact on kids of having two working parents?,"From all the classes I have taken (I have a Bachelor’s degree in Human Development and Family Studies), we learned that the primary factors influencing child outcomes when both parents work is the happiness of the parents with their roles. Looking back through one of my textbooks (Child, Family, School, Community: Socialization and Support 7th ed. by Roberta Berns), it states that when a working mother is happy with working and her job, she has similar relationships with her children as a mother who does not work outside the home. However, if a working mother does not enjoy working, whether the job is stressful or she would rather be at home, it has shown to have a negative impact on the parent-child relationship. Better relationships between parent and child lead to better child outcomes. The same can also be said for the other way around. If a stay-at-home parent does not enjoy staying at home and would rather be working, this will have a negative impact on the children. So in sum, each family has to figure out what works for them. All of this though is assuming that children have high-quality care outside of the home and quality time with their parents like you state.  "
Disclosing parent separation to all children together or each one separately,"I am not sure there is a right answer, but to me, it would make sense to do it together. The reasoning for this is the following:  So, I would say: all together is easier for all concerned... hopefully including you, not having to do the same hard talk several times."
How can a father teach his girl child about menstruation?,"As a male who previously worked customer service for feminine care products, I think I might be able to provide some advice here. Get familiar with the different feminine hygiene brands.  Assuming you are in the US, that's Kotex, Always, Stayfree, Tampax, Playtex, etc.  Don't just assume that having the talk is the end of it.  There will be an adjustment period (no pun intended) as the daughter gets accustomed to wearing pads and finding which one works best for her flow needs.  In the meantime, there may be some embarrassing leakage incidents which will need to be handled with understanding and maturity.  Don't make this any harder than it already is for her.  If he's the primary launderer as well, make sure that he can identify and properly launder the staining and adhesive residue that will likely occur with some of her clothing during this process. Spend some time in the feminine care aisle.  Understand the difference between the different products.  You're probably going to end up in this aisle trying to find the one product your daughter says that ""works"", and it isn't fun to get back from the store with the wrong ones. The internet is your friend here.  In addition to lots of product information, some feminine care product websites like Always and Kotex brands also contain information about different women's health issues like menstruation, body changes during puberty, as well as suggestions for parents that are bringing up the subject for the first time with their daughter.  Some of this information is printable so you can use hand it directly to the daughter and allow her to read it at her own pace.  The Kotex site also has period planners and message boards for asking questions that the girl isn't comfortable enough asking face-to-face. If the internet isn't your thing,  pick up the phone and call the consumer services departments of these companies directly.  There are people there whose sole purpose is to make you feel comfortable with choosing, buying and using feminine care products. Don't try to do it alone.  There are people around that would be happy to help."
How do I prevent my grandchildren from throwing a big fit when I leave them after playing with them for a few hours?,This happens often and they will sort it. As you say they are always happy to see you so it is not something that lasts long with them. Have you tried telling them “Nana has to go shopping now and will see you later (or tomorrow) ” or other simple reasons. Had this when dropping kids off at nursery. Tough for a week or so then they got used to it - it’s often just due to a change in routine. Even the nursery staff helped by asking them to get a game out. It is always tough at the time though.
Foster care for a friend's kids,"Experience: former foster parent (certified in CA) At least in my state, friends and family are considered first, and are not required to be officially certified (in fact, to my knowledge, many rules that apply to official foster parents do not apply to them). If you talk with the social worker for your friend, you should be able to put yourself in line to have the children placed with you."
What can I do to get my wife to be more involved?,"My wife, almost two weeks after a C-section, is able to do practically all work related to baby care. Only baths are left to me, and even then she does assist me. I'd like to think we do 50% of the work, but actually she probably does more. I am currently on a leave and soon I will go to work - and during the day she will have to take care of our baby on her own.  This does not seem like a physical problem. I'd say it's entirely psychological. And as with most psychological problems - you should try to talk it over. Try to learn what she feels, just let her talk - if she is willing. Listen carefully. It is possible that she feels ""unnecessary"" - since you were handling the baby so well. I would try to ask her for help, even when you are perfectly capable of handling a situation on your own, so that she would feel more needed. That's just an idea. Postpartum depression is a well documented and quite often happening illness. Consider seeking professional help."
How much should I interact with my newborn?,"Yes, the more interaction you and your wife have with your child, the better! Babies are learning at a phenomenal rate, and the more stimulus they receive, the more they are able to pick up about the world around them.
Studies have shown that there is a link between parents reading to young infants and reading habits: Shared book reading at 4-months was not predictive of later expressive language, but it 
  was related to shared book reading at 8-months, indicating a reading habit can be 
  established and persist until the infant is more ready to benefit educationally from shared 
  book reading. Increased interactions with your child help teach the infant to recognize you and your wife.  These interactions will also lead to your child giving their first true smile sometime over the next few weeks, and trust me: that is not something you want to miss! :) Touching and massaging your child regularly can have significant benefits. Even though you aren't going to see huge levels of response from a 2 month old, the more you interact, the better you will become at recognizing your child's body language and other cues as to whether they are happy, content, hungry, uncomfortable, or just plain bored."
What harm is porn?,"""Porn"" runs a wide gamut of idealized or fantasy scenarios.  Many, if not most, of pornographic materials, portray intimate relations in a way that is not typical. I would imagine a pornographic movie that depicts the awkward ""getting to know each other"" phase, dating, and the social and emotional intimacy that most parents would hope their children would seek prior to sexual activity would be pretty boring. Instead, at best you'll get scenarios which encourage casual sexual encounters, which increase risk of sexually transmitted diseases.  At worst, the material could depict sexual scenarios or fantasies that could include BDSM, rape fantasy, or general physical aggression.  The main dangers of this is that the child could confuse these behaviors for ""normal"", and try to replicate them during actual situations. In other words, pornographic materials are based upon an implicit level of consent that may be obscured by the fact that they are fake portrayals by actors or actresses, and a child viewing the materials may not be aware that the acts seen in the materials should not be engaged in without explicit consent by their partner. Edit
I included the following references to highlight that there are other areas of potential concern.  However, please note that the Psychology Today blog entry does not list its sources, and the 2003 survey is just that: a survey.  Surveys aren't the most effective method of scientific research, although that doesn't mean it should be dismissed out of hand. Still, take the conclusions from both these sources with a grain of salt.  In my opinion, the primary concern is the unrealistic depiction of intimate relationships, as described in the previous portion of my answer. This article in Psychology Today raises several areas of concern (articles linked are possible matches found): Early Sex A 2012 study shows that movies influence teens’ sexual attitudes and behaviors as well. The study, published in Psychological Science, found that the more teens were exposed to sexual content in movies, the earlier they started having sex and the likelier they were to have casual, unprotected sex. In another study, boys who were exposed to sexually explicit media were three times more likely to engage in oral sex and intercourse two years after exposure than non-exposed boys. Young girls exposed to sexual content in the media were twice as likely to engage in oral sex and one and a half times more likely to have intercourse. High Risk Sex Research shows that children who have sex by age 13 are more likely to have multiple sexual partners, engage in frequent intercourse, have unprotected sex and use drugs or alcohol before sex. In a study by researcher Dr. Jennings Bryant, more than 66 percent of boys and 40 percent of girls reported wanting to try some of the sexual behaviors they saw in the media (and by high school, many had done so), which increases the risk of sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancies. Intimacy Disorders research shows that early exposure to pornography is a risk factor for sex addictions and other intimacy disorders. In one study of 932 sex addicts, 90 percent of men and 77 percent of women reported that pornography was a factor in their addiction. Sexual Violence According to some studies, early exposure (by age 14) to pornography and other explicit material may increase the risk of a child becoming a victim of sexual violence or acting out sexually against another child. A 2003 survey of youth exposure to unwanted sexual materials(original if link breaks) highlights another risk: a child may simply find pornographic material disturbing or upsetting.  Without the hormonal changes and normal desires driving them to explore intimacy in a ""normal"" context, sudden exposure to pornographic material can be... well, gross.  According to the survey, about 1/4 of the youth exposed to unwanted sexual materials were actively and extremely upset about what they saw.  17% avoided the Internet as a result of the exposure, and 6% thought about it and couldn't stop."
Will reading the same book in two languages confuse my daughter?,"Don’t worry. I have 3 kids who are now fluent in 3 languages... When the youngest was learning to count we were giving her the numbers in either of two languages - because she was also at nursery where she only got one language. One day she was asked to count so she did in French. Then her brother asked her to count in English - she did and then it seemed to dawn on her that she had two ways of naming numbers ... So, upside is kids will assimilate two languages with ease. Downside is that because they are processing double the vocabulary then progress can be slow at times. Just don’t worry and it will get sorted. She was slower than her peers at reading for a while, but then caught up and was reading in two languages in front of the class... At school her peers are now learning English and she is coasting...  Have just remembered a book that we had in both languages - but the format and pictures were the same: Big Hare and Little Hare discussing ""How much I love you"" (answer all the way to the moon ... and back). She loved it in either language -  good bedtime read. One issue I did face was my kids pointing out my limited vocabulary in my second language as theirs increased, as well as my pronunciation.. :) That is a good indicator of their progression though."
How do I tell my parents I'm no longer Christian?,"I'm not sure you do have to tell them, at least not now. What seems to be the urgent issue is this job. If you really think you can't stand doing it for a little while (I assume it's temporary?), which may look good on your CV (resumé), then you have to break it to them seriously but gently. I would suggest avoiding the theological issue if possible. These debates quickly get messy, especially when family are involved. You can let them discover that naturally, much later. I suggest you phrase it something like, ""I've been giving this job some serious thought and I really think it isn't right for me."". Try to avoid accusing them of pushing/bullying you into it and understand that they probably had your best interests at heart. I think they will be much more likely to accept this if you: Both of these will show that you've given it the serious thought you claimed and that you're not going to spend years bumming around at home. You're an adult now, so as well as making your own decisions, you need to begin to manage your parents, humouring them or avoiding certain topics in order to keep everyone happy. If you avoid telling your parents about your rejection of Christianity, that may seem dishonest. However, considering the amount of pain it may cause them to think their child is going to hell, maybe keeping the full truth of your opinions from them may be the kinder thing to do. Keeping off the topic may be difficult. Often these differences of opinion can be like an insect bite that people can't help scratching, even though it makes it worse. Perhaps instead you could work on doing something non-religious, which you feel motivated about and would still make them proud of you. A good job or some charitable endeavour perhaps? Ultimately you have to use your own judgement, as none of us know your parents/grandparents and how they would react. Good luck."
Is it ok to let my 3 month old drop her head a few inches during 'tummy time'?,"This is the result of a normal developmental stage, perhaps made more noticeable in your case by having a baby who started rolling earlier than average, and your baby isn't likely to get severely hurt by just leaving her to it.  On the other hand, I have seen babies get a bruise  on their forehead from doing this, and I personally couldn't really bear to see my son hitting his head (although he didn't seem a bit bothered). I solved it by putting the playmat on a carpeted area, or I put down a thicker quilt or several bath towels under the matt to provide a little cushioning for his head, and that worked well for us.  You can also use those dense foam interlocking 'tiles' that are sometimes used in playrooms or workout areas, or the version sold specifically for a baby play area. (For the same reason that you shouldn't use quilts in the crib, don't leave your baby unattended with stacks of thick blankets or quilts.  It's a potential suffocation hazard.) The stage where your baby keeps letting her head 'drop' will pass quickly as she strengthens her neck muscles, masters rolling and learns to move her head up and down with more precision and control, so it's definitely something that will become less of an issue regardless of if you do something or nothing. For now, let her keep on 'bopping' as long as she doesn't seem unhappy, but with some extra cushioning for her comfort, and yours."
How and when should I teach my children how to swim?,"I'm just going to give a bit on swimming lessons first, even though its not the answer you want, it can provide some answers to the ""when"". Then I'll talk about some of the things we do in the classes which you could do on your own, as lessons are a good guide. I live in Australia, where its very common to start taking your children to swimming lessons from 6 months. Even though obviously they won't be able to swim until later on, its very important to teach them about water, water safety, understanding to hold their breath when they do go underwater. I have a 2yo who has just finished her second term of swimming lessons (we started her at 12 months, intended to start earlier). She can now swim with a floating device on her back (not for long and I would not be much more than an arms reach away from her. The classes for 3 year olds+ I believe they start to learn to swim on their own. As I mentioned we started our daughter at 12 months, so I'm less aware about the routines they do in the youngest classes. Some of the beginner things she's done from 12-24 months are: With all these things, as they get better you can support them less, and get them to do more on their own. I know you said all under 6 years old, so some of the activities may be too basic for them. I'd really suggest getting some sort of floatation device, (floaties, lifejacket) and assisting them until they feel comfortable on their own. But I don't have the experience with older kids yet, so its just what I'd imagine would be good. I should also note as I did in my other answer. Learn CPR for kids!"
How can I stop my toddler from playing with electrical outlets and plugs?,"There are two general strategies I know of: Out of sight, out of mind
Try to make the outlets and power-bars inaccessible. Move them out of sight, use coverlets to prevent the sockets from being exposed, hide them where the toddler can't reach them. This will likely not prevent eventual contact, but it might prevent it for long enough. Get power bars which are too complicated for children to operate - such as ones which come with electronic timers and off switches. Use plastic plugs and covers on all outlets in the house, ensuring nothing can be put into them.  Surrender - Embrace the fascination
Teach your kid how to handle the devices safely. Use simple words and exaggerated facial and body language, and show him exactly which parts are dangerous. If you can, show him exactly why they are dangerous - relying on a book maybe too abstract for him at this young age. If possible, have him follow along with your proper handling procedures, on a toy, as you do them with a real device next to him. Go through the explanations several times in a row  (6), and repeat them, daily, for several days. Refresh the explanation regularly after that, such as, for example, on every occasion that you are handling a power bar near him."
My 7 year old daughter is the team cry baby...how do I help her stop?,"The problem here is finding a positive non-crying reinforcement strategy. Statements like ""other girls don't cry"" or ""don't humiliate yourself"" are unlikely to work, since they're rather negative. You have to make her want not to cry. Have you tried a small bribery? Keep it positive, like ""if you are strong and brave the whole game I'll get you the football you've always wanted"". Or you can start with ice-cream, or watching a good movie. You can also try watching some games with her and pointing out (not too strongly, so that she doesn't realize what you're trying to do) players which have done something badly, like: ""this shot was absolutely terrible, he must feel really bad about himself; he does try harder though, see how fast he is running now?"". You can also record a game and watch it (or at least check the score) and point out players which have made something really terribly, only to later show that they have scored a magnificent goal."
How do you discipline someone else's child?,"You don't. Your issue is with the parent, not the child. If the parent is not willing to step in and do their job, then why would you put up with either of them? Unfortunately, disciplining an adult is rather more difficult."
How can a parent encourage their child to talk more about what they did at school?,"Yeah, normal. Some things that work in our family: Appreciate that they're tired straight after school and might need some quiet time and space. Ask them specific questions about things that you already know a bit about, e.g.  This shows that you listened to them last time they told you about stuff, and it shows more specific (and therefore more believable) interest than a blanket ""how was your day?"", which can seem perfunctory, and so gets a perfunctory answer. They're pretty interested in the adult world - and I'm trying to provide them with an example for them to copy of how to talk about the things that happen in our lives.... which things are considered important, things that I enjoyed and things that I had trouble with, and how I dealt with problems (if I did) and what I'd do differently next time. I feel that if I tell them about that kind of thing in relation to my life, then they'll be more willing to tell me about that kind of thing in relation to their life. Sometimes we end up trading information: I tell them what I had for lunch and they immediately pipe up wanting to tell me what they had for lunch; I tell them about the best/worst thing that happened in my day and they immediately want me to know the best/worst thing that happened in their day. So I'm not actually asking any questions at all - this can work quite well. You might find the classic book ""How To Talk So Kids Will Listen and Listen So Kids Will Talk"" (Faber and Mazlich) useful. Sometimes if I've taken them on a trip and we've left their mum at home, then on the way home we think about what things we'll tell mum about the trip: what did we each like best (eg dinosaurs, lunch), whether we want to go again, who do we know that would really like it, was it scary/exciting/interesting etc ... So I'm trying to give them some practice in summarising the salient details of a larger experience. Also, their mum actually wants to know how the trip went. ;)"
How can an older brother fill the parenting void of an absent father?,"Anger is part of the grieving process, and everyone works through it in their own way and at their own pace.  Specifically, the ""suck it up"" approach might work for you, but girls usually need someone to vent to who will listen, sympathize, not judge, and not try to tell them how to ""fix it"" until they get it all out.  They are probably acting with more maturity than you think, but are letting loose at home where they feel safe so they won't lose it at school or elsewhere.  The faster you let them get it all out, the faster they will recover.  Trying to stop the anger in its tracks only prolongs it. Also, don't try to replace your dad, just be a brother.  Don't tell your sisters what to do, show them and be there for them.  Good parenting requires years of practice and building a large foundation of authority and trust, usually starting when it's much easier because they're too small to run away and too young to talk back.  However, you are already well qualified to be a brother."
How do you teach a toddler rhythm and melody?,"You might consider starting with clapping games, like pat-a-cake. These games are effective because you know when you are out of synch because of your partner. Success is being able to play the game smoothly. The speed can be increased to make it more challenging. I started teaching my kids by having them press the back of my hands as I was clapping. To them, it felt like they were making my hands clap while I was controlling the rhythm. Lots of singing and clapping, banging, and dancing to music will naturally support their rhythm development. EDIT: Ever been to a powwow? There are lots of drums and people are encouraged to clap and stop their feet. Children usually play a role in the festivities. "
12 year old with major tantrums that I have no idea how to control help needed,"Oh wow, what a lousy situation for all of you!  It depends on where you live, but one resource I'd suggest is whatever social services you have available.  She could probably use the services of a professional to help her unpack all the things going on in her life: father with a history of violence towards family who is also in-and-out of her life, the usual sturm und drang that comes with adolescence, a mom who is stretched to the limit and who she seems to feel she can only interact with in a loud and threatening manner.  Poor kid sounds like she's acting out, trying to get someone to fix things in her life.   Talk with your local social services, and see if you can get a recommendation for free or sliding-scale professional help. Since you say she was better once her Dad lived away, and worse when he moved closer and she could see him every day, I'm cautiously hopeful that once she's not interacting with him on a daily basis she'll feel a bit better too.   Hang in there, remind her frequently that you love her and aren't going anywhere (I'm sure part of her frustration is losing her father again to a new family), and be kind to yourself. And do look into getting some help with the situation; you can't be expected to fix EVERYONE'S problems, and you have a lot on your plate. "
Email and social media for pre-teens,"First of all, Gmail will allow you to 'delegate' email to another address. my 10 yo daughter has an email address that i delegated to my main gmail address. Dropdown at my name on the screen and i can open her mailbox. I do it regularly. Secondly, if you notified those services, they would delete or block the accounts. Not personally sure that would be my decision, but that's up to you. Personally, it would depend on how pissed off I was about the lying part. Which is what I think you should focus on: lying and subterfuge. My MAIN OVERARCHING concern with my kids is keeping them safe. I tell them what I tell them to keep them safe. ""If you don't do what I tell you, then I can't keep you safe. If you're LYING to me, then you're purposefully putting yourself outside of the things i can do to keep you safe."" These are my words, but i've never met anyone that disagrees with it. So in that same vein, I think you should pull out some Scared Straight. Even tho you've apparently already had the big reveal, you can still do this to drive home the point that you, as the parent, occasionally know what you're talking about. ad nauseum Do some creative googling and you can come up with IMO too many of these sad stories. TBPH this is the thing that keeps me up at night. Now your girl is going to tell you she's had it all under control, right? She's only talked to kids from school? yeah . . . ask her if she's ever talked to a friend of a school friend, or someone that says they met her at, say another school or at someplace outside of school... while it's likely harmless, it will absolutely put the Holy Crap question in her mind. And that's what it's all about. Because as a parent, you've outlined rules for her to follow to prevent these things at a very low level. You probably didn't even think about specific scenarios when putting the rules in place becuase you knew the rules would take care of it. So beyond the interaction, afterwards don't try to put the genie back in the bottle. You simply cannot delete unfettered computer access from her life, and trying to do so would only serve as a wedge. But you can certainly give her enough knowledge to 1) build her own boundaries and 2) come to you when something seems fishy. You might also lay down the law ""you can keep the email, but only if i get access"" . . . which, of course, is based on a certain level of trust. These are technical solutions. Social solutions are going to require conversation and negotiation. And with an 11 yo girl, I wish you all the best. I've denied my own need to have these conversations, so I'm quite interested to know how this turns out for you."
How to create learning opportunities for the toddler who is already *extremely* interested in books?,"Pretty much every page of every children's book we own has new learning opportunities for our two year old! It's a pretty awesome time. You can always go into more detail about the illustrations and the story. In general, these are the subjects I ask questions or make comments about: I'm sure there's more! For instance, I'm sure it won't be long before I start working on texture with my son (smooth vs. rough). A tact I usually take is to pick a certain subject I want to focus on for the story time, and teach about that. I usually only pick one or two things, because I don't want to slow down the pace of the book and cause disinterest. So, if I decide to work on counting, I'll only do one or two counting examples per page, and otherwise read the book as normal. What's great is that your toddler loves to be read to! My son does, as well. He has plenty of books, and they've all been read to him dozens of times. Nevertheless, we are able to make each reading unique. It's also helped me to have had some foreign language education. When you start to learn a different language, you realize just how many types of words and concepts you need to know! So when I teach my son, I take the approach that anything and everything can be explained in more detail. Think of how you'd explain it to somebody just learning English as a second language, because you're actually teaching someone who is just learning English as a first language.  An introductory textbook or website (such as DuoLingo) for foreign languages, may give you ideas on what topics to focus on. I think the best way to explain this is with an actual example. So, here's a page from a Little Critter book by Mercer Meyer, titled When I Get Bigger.  These are things I can ask/explain to go into more detail: To me, this page is actually pretty sparse, but it's just one page."
Why is my baby suddenly screaming in the bath?,"Something happened. What, nobody knows except him. Probably he is now reminded of this when you give him a bath, and he starts screaming. If you now force him to have a bath even though he is screaming, this will just keep on making it worse. For every bath you give him while he is screaming, the association between horror and bathing will be stronger. You'll need to reverse that process, by ""amateur behavioral therapy"", ie, you will have to make bath time fun, and you will have to make him slowly get used to bath time again, making sure you keep it fun and happy at all times, and that you also take him out before he want to, so that he longs back to the bath, and remember that the next time. I've gone through several spells like this with my daughter, the first one cause by her not liking the bathtub we used at my grandmas, one by her having to take a baths in the big tub at her aunties, as there was no small tub there, and one or two others of unknown origin. Patient, calm and gradual approaches to bathing worked, starting with a patient, calm and gradual approach to the bath tub. Make sure he doesn't scream when he sees the bath tub. Let him play in it without water. The next day you fill it with water and let him splash, but do not put him into the water. The next day he might stand in the water and splash. Then next day wash him, while he is standing. The next day he can sit and play, and soon you'll be back to happy bath times again! I used the same approach to get her used to using the big tub, which she originally was scared of."
Would it be bad to only speak to a child  in a language in which you are not completely fluent?,"I grew up in America, but my parents are both from Iran. My Persian is not terribly strong (probably 3-4 grade level as well), but I try to exclusively speak it to my kids. I find it challenging at times, particularly because there is much more English around them than Persian (friends, in-laws, TV, my wife). But the benefits for my children are worth the effort for me.  For me the goal is not necessarily to get them to the point of fluency (even though that would be nice). Language proficiency is a sufficient goal. They may not be able to carry on a technical discussion, but as adults they could perhaps know enough to carry on simple conversations.  Aside from my personal goals, there are linguistic and cognitive benefits to learning multiple languages from an early age. The cognitive benefits of learning multiple languages from an early age are explained by The American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages:  Children who learn a foreign language beginning in early childhood demonstrate certain cognitive advantages over children who do not. ... Additionally, foreign language learning is much more a cognitive problem solving activity than a linguistic activity, overall. Studies have shown repeatedly that foreign language learning increases critical thinking skills, creativity, and flexibility of mind in young children. Students who are learning a foreign language out-score their non-foreign language learning peers in the verbal and, surprisingly to some, the math sections of standardized tests. This relationship between foreign language study and increased mathematical skill development, particularly in the area of problem solving, points once again to the fact that second language learning is more of a cognitive than linguistic activity.    Another study finds: Italian psychologists Agnes Melinda Kovacs and Jacques Mehler have found that part of [bilingual childrens'] skill lies in being more flexible learners than their monolingual peers. Their exposure to two languages at an early point in their lives trains them to extract patterns from multiple sources of information. Here are some things you can do:"
Is it normal for a husband to sleep significantly more while his wife is pregnant?,"This is documented, and is known as Couvade syndrome: Couvade syndrome, also called sympathetic pregnancy, is a proposed condition in which a partner experiences some of the same symptoms and behavior of an expectant mother. These most often include minor weight gain, altered hormone levels, morning nausea, and disturbed sleep patterns. In more extreme cases, symptoms can include labor pains, postpartum depression, and nosebleeds. The Wikipedia article has some interesting information and links to additional reading."
"8 month old not babbling, when to worry and what to worry about","This is a clip of the Denver II Developmental Milestones checklist:   If you draw a vertical line from the slash in dada/mama specific and the ""c"" in dada/mama non-specific, you'll have the 8 month old line. The white rectangle is ""average""; the blue one means ""late but still normal"". Falling off the blue box means ""possibly prudent to follow-up"". There it is in black, white, and blue. Your baby is fine, because he says ""aaaah"", which is a syllable. You're asking for a black and white answer (exactly where between 8 months and 30 years), but the truth is, there is no black and white answer. There is only the whole picture.  One study tried to correlate infant language acquisition milestones (as well as the other three categories of acquisition) to later cognitive ability, and failed pretty spectacularly. The age of reaching developmental milestones was associated with intellectual performance at ages 8, 26, and 53 years; for every month earlier a child learned to stand, there was, on average, a gain of one half of one intelligence quotient point at age 8. Speech development had a small but statistically significant effect on subsequent educational attainment (later developers were less likely to progress beyond basic education); this effect was not apparent for motor development. Effect sizes were reduced when the slowest developers were excluded, but many effects remained significant. Here, ""significant"" is clearly in the eyes of the researcher; the truth is there was no conclusion except this may be important, but we're not at all able to prove it. There is no age-specific correct answer to your question. Fortunately or unfortunately, it depends on all the other pieces of information available. What some causes are for lack of communication is, I think, a separate question. Infant developmental milestones and subsequent cognitive function"
Cleaning bathtub toys that squirt water,"Whenever possible, throw them out. You can't, unfortunately always do that (well you can, if you're ready for the consequences of being responsible for ducky's untimely demise).  I did this, which worked. When done, the toy should not smell like anything at all (well, aside from the smell of the latex / rubber). Again, this works on something that isn't completely crusted inside with mold or mildew. When possible, just pitch the toy if it starts to reek. You can always do it on the sneak, after getting a replacement. "
At what age can/should a child be able to clean themselves after bowel movements?,"Our Kindergarten, in Northeast US, required potty training to be complete - so the kids can go and take care of themselves.  Kindergarten here begins at 5 years, in my area, so I would expect most kids be capale of doing this by themselves.  In our DayCare when my son was 4 years he was expected to know most of this, and did pretty well with it, we did put toilet training off a bit but he caught on quickly.  The important thing was to make him think it was natural and we needed to be clean afterwards, but when it was messy it became a challenge. We instituted hand washing for pretty much anything, although my wife goes overboard on certain things more than me, but I still have a rule that if you have gone into the bathroom you don't come out without washing your hands.  Mostly due to my time working in restaurant kitchens, but I like to prevent issues. If your son has loose bowels like you mention it may be a bit much for him to clean up by himself, we've learned to deal with it as adults but often kids think its more gross than it is.  My son has the same reactions, and at home sometimes calls us in to wipe himself - even at 6 years old.  I may give him toilet paper but it has be a real issue for me to do anything, and that is mostly when he is sick.  Since my oldest is now able to take care of himself and did a fairly good job around 3 years old we are going to do the same with our youngest (18 months) and hopefully have him ready about the same time. The way I looked at it, once our child could reach ""back there"" and knew what was going on, then it was time for him to be able to do it.  Maturity level in many things of course matters with most kids, but they should be able to start doing it on their own, and I know plenty of 3 year olds than can handle the job by themselves.  Considering many of our day care and pre-schools also have the requirement that by 4 years old kids should be completely toilet trained, to know when to go and clean up, then I don't think this is unrealistic either."
How does one address Christianity with their children in a mixed faith marriage?,"First and foremost, make sure your husband is okay with whatever you share.  Even if you are certain he won't object, I suggest you still check with him, if only to keep him feeling like he has a say.   My wife and I are in a similar position: she is Christian, and I am decidedly not.   Unlike you, my wife has belonged to her church for her entire life, so she has resources available that may not be an option to you.  However, you mentioned that you don't feel comfortable taking your daughter to any of the local churches on a regular basis... but how would you feel about taking her to selected events? My wife's Church has various family- and children-oriented special activities scheduled throughout the year, ranging from pot-luck dinners and chili cook-offs to children olympic-style events and ""bible camp"".  Some of those might be good introductions to the community aspect of Christianity, and frequently (based off of my admittedly limited exposure), the focus on the activity precludes the more heavy-handed messages that may demonstrate intolerance. Selected holiday services may be an option, as well.  I can't say I've ever attended a Christmas service, but perhaps that might be focused enough that you could find a church you were comfortable enough bringing your daughter to see what its all about. Be sure to make sure that you clearly communicate to her that she can ask you whatever questions she might have.  Ideally, the materials you would use would be the ones you already use, if any.  If there are books (including your own copy of the bible), videos, activities, etc. that you use, even occasionally, share them with your daughter.  I wouldn't put too much faith (if you'll pardon the pun!) on books, videos, or activities designed to ""teach"" a specific faith to a child.  Especially a game!   The best way to teach a faith while leaving room for open discussion, and informed decision by your child, is to simply model what it means to you.  This may mean that you should become more active about the things you believe, but which you may have set aside for various reasons. By way of the example, I have started performing the blessings and the ceremony of the lighting of our menorah, so that my son will grow up with those being a part of our family traditions, even though I am not a practicing member of the Jewish faith (my parents were both raised Jewish, though, and self-identify as such). Similarly, I plan on taking my son to my ""church"" (parks and areas of unspoiled wilderness) when he's older, and explaining why those locations are so important to me."
How do you discourage a toddler from hitting people?,"At some point, in the myriad parenting books, articles, and magazines my wife and I read, somebody said that the best way to discipline a child under 2 is to do the following: Of course, sometimes they still go back to the same activity, at which time, the recommendation was to remove them from the situation and distract them with something else. You can do this by walking them into a different room and doing something different with them. This has worked very well for us with all of our children."
Introducing my children into my disbelief in a Christian environment,"This is a concept that took me some years into my adulthood to really understand. In my youth, I was fervently anti-theistic agnostic. Then I spent time as a very devoted member of an almost fundamentalist sect of Christianity. Now, I've comfortably settled into a comfortable ambivalent atheism. It's only been in this latter stage where I've realized how to disagree with someone else's beliefs without trying to tear them down. Keeping a respectful, accepting tone when speaking of other belief systems is of tantamount importance. You don't want to be condescending, incredulous, or even skeptical in your tone. Likewise, when talking about your own beliefs you don't want to sound superior, cocky, or aggressive. Using non-neutral tones is divisive, and may actually make actually be counter-productive. If people are praying, you can participate by being present and being silent while everyone else is doing the prayer. In this way, you're respecting their beliefs without disrespecting your own. If asked to pray, you can politely decline. If your children need to study religious material, you can help them study it. What you're doing is spending quality time with your child that's also educational. Some schools teach about Greek myths (or other myths) or other religions (Judaism and Islam), but I doubt you'd feel hypocritical helping them study those materials.  Helping your child learn something that is important to them, and doesn't teach them values you find abhorrent, is something you should strive for regardless of the religiosity of the material. At this point in time, they may be putting what they're studying into practice, but you'll need to mentally separate helping your child learn and be successful from what they're learning and how they're being successful. While you hope that the school will teach critical thinking skills, and maybe some level of skepticism, it's ultimately your responsibility to do that. If you want your children to be aware of other belief systems, including non-religions, then you'll have to teach about them. The best way to do this, of course, is by being educated about the different belief systems yourself. When your children ask questions that may have a religious answer, you can answer with a variety of options. For example:   ""What happens when we die?""
  ""Well, Catholics and some other religions believe you may go to Heaven. But, some religions think you may come back to Earth as someone else. And some people don't think anything happens at all.""    Granted, these are simplified versions of complex beliefs on the matter, but they'd do well to answer a child's question and maybe inspire some curiosity. It'd be up to you as to whether or not you'd wanted to introduce more structured teaching about other religions. Personally, I think answering applicable questions with two or more beliefs is an adequate way to handle this. Your child learns there are other beliefs, and can dig deeper into them if they desire. If you're presenting all alternatives with the same accepting tone, then your child will pick up on the fact that it's okay to have those other beliefs. At some point, I think it'll be best if you have a family meeting and explain mom's and dad's beliefs, and how they're different. There's no reason for your children to know only your wife's beliefs. If you're made to be uncomfortable sharing what you think, then the relationship is not equal. The meeting could go something like this: You'll obviously need your wife's full support for this meeting to happen. She has to be willing to allow you to share your beliefs, but also agree to abide by the idea of supporting the children if they choose not to continue in Catholic beliefs in the future. Please note, I'm not talking about school. Children can get a fine education at a Catholic school without necessarily taking Catholicism to heart. There's no real reason that changing schools needs to even be discussed. You also have to agree on the when of this meeting. It shouldn't be held off for any reason, but it's not immediately pressing. Ideally, your children would have reach their current ages already knowing this stuff. (Ideally to me, that is.) However, if you're worried this may affect your son's commitment to his First Communion, then it may be best to wait until after that. Not because that belief is more important than yours, but your son's mental health is more important than your beliefs. Lastly, you'll have to agree to answer questions in a way that takes into account both parents. You'll need to try and answer the relevant questions the way your wife would and the way you would. She should also be trying to answer such questions for herself and for you. This way, you're presenting yourself to your children as a team that understands one another and works in unity, even if not together. If one of you isn't quite sure how to answer in a way the other parent would, then it'd be a great time to say, ""I'm not sure what your [other parent] would say, so you should ask them."""
Making the child finish their food even if they are already full [duplicate],"Advantages....
None Disadvantages...
It creates unnecessary conflict with the child, and it compromises the child's natural ability to self-regulate food intake based on nutrition requirements. As long as children are offered healthy food (no junk food) they will naturally eat what they need and no more. Forcing them to finish their plate can potentially lead to eating disorders, and/or obesity later in life. It teaches the child that they should eat food because it is there, not because they need it. This notion that it prevents food from being wasted is complete nonsense. If the child is eating more than they require, then the food is wasted anyway, as the body can't effectively use it. It either stores it as fat, or simply passes it through not properly digested."
When is physical punishment appropriate?,"I'm trying to think of a case, and I can't. So: Never? Update: I think my answer is less helpful than some that got less votes so I'm updating it to be more helpful and also to show that the question may not be subjective, and that it shouldn't necessarily be closed, but that it should be fixed. Here goes. It is a well established fact that hitting your kids is a bad idea and may make your kids more aggressive. Corporal punishment doesn't make your kids more well behaved, they tend to make them less well behaved. And if you want more links, I refer you to philosodads answer. Since this is well established and uncontroversial, the question can reasonably be interpreted as asking when it is appropriate with physical punishment with the basic standpoint that it in general is not appropriate. In that way, the question is about if it ever is appropriate, but badly formulated. This is how I first interpreted it. This probably shows a naivety on my side with respect to the average level of ignorance on these issues, which I started noticing from an answer here that actually advocates corporal punishment for discipline and instilling respect for adults. In this interpretation, the question is indeed subjective. But the debate, I think, has clearly shown that this is not how the question in general is interpreted. Instead it has generally been interpreted to ask how and when to use corporal punishment for discipline. I don't know if that was the OP's intention, but that is clearly how may others have interpreted it. And in that case the question is not subjective. In that case there is a clear and objective answer, and it is: It is not appropriate  with corporal punishment. The links above and in philosodads answer shows this with little doubt."
How do you teach morals and values in non-religious households?,You raise them with morals by being good parents and instilling your own values upon them. Morals don't require some form of sanctioned text books. 
Learning to play an instrument: Should we insist that our child practices each day?,"The key to getting a reluctant practiser to practise anything (a musical instrument, reading, physical exercise, whatever) is to change from: Time for you to go practise X! to OK, time for us to do your X! I don't mean stand over him with a timer and glare to ensure he doesn't stop at 9 minutes 30 seconds. I mean you show your enthusiasm for the starting of the task. You listen intently to what he's doing. You talk to him about it. You point out where he's noticeably improving - that passage is so much smoother now! - and directly tie it to the work he is putting in. You smile and react and show your involvement. You turn the pages of the book, or suggest what to play next. You really intensely care about the piano practising, or the kata repetition, or the reading. And when it's done, you praise the work that was put in.  Long term improvements like learning the piano or becoming an A student are hard to see progress on. But being able to land a jump or play a passage that you couldn't do last week is a huge motivator. Seven year olds (and twelve year olds, and some thirty year olds) may not notice - but if you're there to point it out, they will. You will come to enjoy those ten minutes a day together, and the chore will become something not quite so chore-y."
How to avoid corporal punishment?,"We've recently read Positive Parenting, and it has several suggestions we're going to implement. First, no TV within an hour of bedtime for either child.  This is from me, not from the book-- TV is just too stimulating, even the most simplistic programs, so once one kid's going to bed, shut it off for the other one to get him to calm down.  I have our TV plugged into a power strip, and I'll just trip the switch when I want TV to be off.  No ifs, ands, or buts-- if it's off, it's off.  If it really becomes an issue, I'll trip the breaker to the living room.  Also, we only have one TV, rather than multiple TVs spread throughout the house. Second, make a chart detailing the bedtime steps using pictures featuring the son in question.  So, for us, the photos are: That way, we can point to which step we are in the process, and get him through from one step to the next.  Making the chart is also fun, and is a project that involves the older child and at least one parent.  We have a printer, so printing the photos and then putting them on a larger piece of paper using a glue stick is pretty straightforward; otherwise, a trip to the local printer or library or something similar may be necessary. The idea is to engage him in bedtime, make it a process he can be a part of by making the chart and walking him through the steps. Third, I'd suggest that the two of you swap off, if possible, between putting one or the other child to bed.  If you're both present and able, one parent should be sufficient to put one child to bed.  If you're not both present or not both able, then that could be a tricky issue as it is.  I've noticed that our son is much more responsive to helping out (ie, ""I need your help to do this!"") rather than being ordered."
Can my 6 years old daughter be my business partner?,"As others have said, the primary thing is that you make this a fun activity that the two of you do together, not a chore. That means that you will wind up doing the bulk of the actual work; do not expect her to sort half the bricks, handle a camera competently, or anything else. As a rule of thumb children under 10 have an attention span in minutes roughly equal to their age in years, so she won't stick at a boring job like sorting blocks for more than about 6 minutes. Also I would suggest being a bit less ambitious about how many business concepts you throw at her initially. A loan is probably too complicated a thing for now; start with the idea that you buy the bricks, put in some work, and then sell it for more. OTOH telling her that you are partners so she gets half the profit (as long as that isn't silly amounts of money for a 6 year old) would be a very good idea. And the idea of doing the marketing together (again, you are going to do the bulk of the work) is good too. One thing to avoid; if she does an Ebay advert or similar thing then she is going to be proud of her work. Avoid the temptation to improve it; that just sends the message that nothing she does is good enough, so she shouldn't bother trying. As long as the advert is honest, let it run. If the item doesn't sell, then discuss how to make it better and try again."
How can I handle a daughter who says she doesn't want to stay with me more than one day?,"I upvoted @Arno's answer because the advice is sound. I'd like to take a different approach. It will sound harsh, but please know I don't mean it to be harsh. I just mean it to hopefully be a better way to look at it. I don't want her to grow away from me. Two things about this statement: 1. although it's perfectly understandable and a normal reaction, first, it's only about you (I understand it's not everything you might feel) where it should be about her as well. 2. She will grow away from you, which is also normal, and while it does hurt, you need to make your feelings your responsibility, not hers. ...it should be about her as well. A different way to look at it is ""I want my daughter to feel good about being at my place, too."" What would that take? It means a conversation (or five or ten) about what makes her happier to be at her mother's house (without your hurt feelings being on display) and any adjustments you can (both) make to make it easier to be at yours. While it may be more complicated than breakfast cereal or toothbrush placement, it should be doable. How much time does she spend in her room at her mother's house? What is her room set-up like there? What are her favorite activities at her mother's house? They may or may not have anything to do with her mother. They might be time on social media, they might be playing games (irl or on a device), etc. If you know your daughter's interests, you can plan accordingly.* She will grow away from you... Kids become adults, and depend less on their parents as they age. It's called independence. They like autonomy and are seeking it out. The vast majority love their parents as much as ever, and they aren't doing it to hurt them; they're doing it because it's an innate desire they have, and it's practice for adulthood. At some point, many kids do become disrespectful (hopefully temporarily) towards their parents, but that's yet to come. Handling this behavior well will prepare you to better handle that behavior if and when it comes. ...you need to make your feelings your responsibility, not hers. She feels what she feels, and whatever you feel (not think) about that, both of your feelings are valid. But how you act on your feelings, your response/behavior, is your responsibility, as is her behavior her responsibility. So you don't tell her her feelings cause you pain. It's fair to tell someone that their behavior upsets you, but not their feelings. For example, if she spends all day in her room on her phone, it's fair to say, ""I think it's okay to spend time on your phone, but I would like to see you more when you're here, since I don't see you everyday. Can we spend more time together?"" (Then explore options.) That's much different than, ""I'm hurt that you prefer to spend time on your phone instead of with me, since I only see you four days a month."" That's making her responsible for your feelings, implying that her preferences are bad and her behavior needs to change in order to make you feel better. It's blaming her for your feelings. Reserve that for only the most serious violations, those where her intent is to hurt you.** I hope that if you try hard to see things from her perspective, the empathy-deficient words she says will cause you less pain. *It would be perfectly normal to want to restrict screen time on her visits with you. But if you do so, make the time irl interesting to her. Find out what she likes and do things oriented towards that. Be creative. My kids liked nusic, so we went to a lot of live performances, both locally and sometimes on a trip to a big city. Etc. **If she tells you you're an idiot and a complete failure as a father, it's fair to tell her that her words wound you to the core. Then, what you do about that is your responsibility. One of my kids picked up on my despair at my failure in a medical case I had spoken with my then-husband about. At a later time when I was discussing their behavior with them, they compared it to my medical failure (e.g. ""It's not like I killed my best friend."" ([not the case but the same intent]) Since that was such a departure from their normal behavior, my response was surprise and a simple recognition: ""You're trying to hurt me."" My child burst into tears, and I comforted them. What they felt - defensive - was normal, however what they said was not kind. But I knew my child to be a kind soul, so I was not hurt. That was a good day. (They weren't all good days.)"
How can we get our son to stop sleeping in our bed?,"Children have all kinds of reasons for feeling more comfortable in the presence of their parents at night. I can respect that. But you need your sleep and your time with your wife.  One option people rarely mention is putting the kid to bed in their parents' room. After months of struggling with our (2.5 year old) second child, I bought a thick foam rubber pad at a fabric store, covered it with sheets, blankets and a pillow and put it on the floor of our bedroom against a wall. That stopped a world of pain and suffering on all of our parts. No more crying in the middle of the night, trying to settle them back into their beds just to start the whole process again. And no sleeping in our bed. Bedtime routine was in the big bed. Reading, cuddling, etc. then time to move to their beds. No muss, no fuss, no cajoling, no asking for water, etc, Sex? There were other empty bedrooms; never in front of the kids. But cuddling and talking in a low voice- or even reading, for that matter - was not a problem.   Sometimes we had two mattresses on the floor depending on the ages of the children. But eventually they all preferred to move into their own bedrooms. If they had a bad dream or other reason (e.g. bad thunderstorm), there was usually a spare on the floor.  We called it the family bedroom. As I said, I haven't seen it proposed here before. But it was so much easier for everyone involved at our house. "
How to teach a toddler to identify colors correctly?,"You should also consider that 2-year-olds often don't react as expected when quizzed.  My son (almost 3) is pretty intelligent for his age, but if I ask him what he did today, no matter what we did, he ""played cars and trains"".  If I ask him what he had for lunch, it was ""macaroni and cheese"".  He seems to find an answer that is a valid answer sometimes, and uses it every time that question is asked, because he doesn't really understand the concepts being discussed (in particular, he doesn't really understand 'past' and 'future', as most kids don't at that age).  He knows what he did, but he doesn't know how to discuss it. So your daughter may know the colors, but not know to correlate the idea of a green thing being green to being asked 'what color is this?'.  To help that along, I would recommend having multiple identical objects of different colors - for my son, it was colorful wooden alphabet blocks with pictures on one side of animals along with alphabet/numbers - and then just talk about how this is the 'green' block and this is the 'blue' block, etc.  Differentiating objects by their color helps to explain the concept that objects 'have' colors."
"Can a son share a bed with his girlfriend, at 27?","I see two aspects in this, summed up in these words:  In the end, the parents are the hosts, and therefore their rules are final. But it is worth a try to discuss these rules before accepting them! This son and his girlfriend are adults. They will be expected to know how to behave themselves (or be quiet about it). For this to be a problem in the first place, it seems to me that the parents have some issues that need to be either addressed, accepted (sleep on the floor), or knowingly ignored (hotel, or sneak upstairs after lights-out).  If I were that son, I'd present my arguments to my parents in the hope to convince them to let me share a room (and bed) with my girlfriend. Frankly, if the parents can't handle two grown-up guests sharing a bed in their house, then the son should take his girlfriend to a nearby hotel for the night. This would likely not be popular with the parents, but that's their problem. If I were those parents, I'd have to realize that we have control issues. Our son is a grown man, and we need to accept that. We could discreetly request him to keep his hands above the covers while he's a guest in this house. But come on -- demanding him to sleep on the floor is nothing short of silly."
Are prenatal classes worth it?,"Our eldest was born almost 3 months premature, before we had a chance to attend our prenatal classes.  We had absolutely no idea what was going on.  By the time we figured out what was happening, the baby was already born.  We spent the next 3 months in the hospital with her until she was well enough to take home. Even though we had already parented 5 children, including our son we later adopted and 3 foster children, taken 40 hours of parenting classes to become foster parents, knew CPR, read a ton of books, and had spent more time in a hospital than anyone else we knew who didn't work in one, we still took the prenatal class when my wife became pregnant again.  I'm glad we did. One of the classes talked about cesarean sections.  Despite everything, it was a possibility my wife had never even considered, and it terrified her.  Having it discussed in the class brought that to the surface and allowed her to come to terms with those feelings and know what to expect.  She turned out to need a C-section due to some complications and was much better prepared for the experience. If everything goes perfectly, the class will likely feel like a waste of time.  If not, you will be glad you attended."
How to tackle sugar addiction [duplicate],"There is an old Indian story: A lady and her son went to a monk asking about her son's sugar problem. The monk said, ""Come back here in 10 days."" After 10 days she went back to the monk with her son. Now the monk says to her son, ""Kid, do not eat sugar. It is not good for your health."" Surprised, the mother asked, ""Why did you not say it before?"" The monk replied, ""10 days ago, I was eating a lot of sugar."" First you must change you eating habits and soon you will find he will start copying you. If you eat fruits and enjoy them, your son will believe they are delicious. Moreover, your son can learn that there are lot of delicious things that are actually healthy for your toddler."
My 9 year old son regards life as meaningless [closed],"Take him to a psychologist. Not because he has a disorder, but because he is highly intelligent and both you and he need to learn how to deal with this gift. Your son needs peers who share his intelligence. I don't know where you live, but any psychologist worth the name knows of local organizations that help highly intelligent children socialize with other highly intelligent children and find for them the special teaching that they need. Where I live, there is a special school for highly intelligent children. If such a school does not exist, your son could skip some classes. Everyone – no matter if they are alcoholics or gay or highly intelligent – is relieved once he finds others who are like him. That is the single most important experience for anyone who is ""different"". The fact that you can talk to someone who knows how you feel is healing in and of itself. And making friends and having people that are interested in the same things will make him happy. Do not send him to the internet unsupervised. He might be highly intelligent, but he still lacks the experience and maturity to deal with some of the more dangerous aspects of the net. There are places where nihilistic people gather and encourage each other in their negativity. Some of this turns to crime, some to suicide or drugs. Despite his intelligence, your son probably needs some kind of social life, and the lack of adequate peers makes him vulnerable, and his negative attitude makes him even more vulnerable. Even if life is ultimately meaningless (which I think it is), you can still have fun with it. My argument to your son's argument is: If you have two hours to live, why would you actively want to be miserable during those two hours? Purely from a logic point of view that seems like a stupid decision. You'll be dead long enough and there is no need to act dead before you die. Your body feels good if you provide it with tasty food. So quite obviously the fact that your body will eventually die, does not prevent it from experiencing pleasure. The same is true for the mind. All you need to do is find pleasant experiences for your mind. It is meaningless that life is meaningless. Life is what you make of it. You can choose to eat sand and feel awful. Or you can choose to eat (whatever tastes great to you) and feel well. I understand that with everyone being different from you and doing things that bore you, you might not know what kind of ""mental food"" you would enjoy. So maybe we can try to find kids who are like you and maybe you'll enjoy their company. It will cost you nothing to try, and you can go back to being miserable if you find that that's what you prefer. (Well, obviously you shouldn't say that verbatim ;-) Give him autobiographies of other gifted people. Or do an internet research and find adults alive today who had been gifted children. Some have had difficult lives, others have found happiness. Show your son the adults and how they are not unhappy but have found something to do with their talent. Maybe some example of what your son might make of his gift will give him a perspective. But most of all you all seem to be completely overwhelmed by the situation and need to get some professional support to help you out of it. It is common that highly intelligent children are depressed, but they quickly become happy once they find the appropriate peers and a schooling that addresses their talents. A psychologist will test your son and find out what his special talents and what his weaknesses are. With this understanding he will help you tackle the problem. Good luck!

I can vouch that most of these people are highly social and very friendly and will certainly make time for an hour to meet with your son. The people at MIT are people. They, too, have families and friends. I would be extremely surprised if no-one there would want to meet your son, especially since he might have real talent in their field. But do not expect an immediate solution. That talk will help you to get feedback on the level of his abilities (make sure you have a few minutes with that person without your son, to get an honest assessment) and for your son to learn what I described above: that life can be fun through his talents. But since the laws of your country probably don't allow your son to skip school and enroll at MIT right away – or, as Steven Gubkin pointed out in his comment above, your son might overestimate his own abilities –, you still need a strategy. If your son is not willing to see a psychologist (which I can understand), find one yourself or find whatever organization there is to help giften children in your area (or nationwide) and contact them and go there alone. Your son is not the first of his kind, and these people will have some practical ideas for the next steps you and your son can take. (If you chose to see a psychologist, don't visit some random psychologist. Call them and ask who they would recommend in your situation. Or contact your local university's psychology department.) There are programs for giften children to visit university while still going to school, or there are special schools or after school activities, and these organizations will know the steps for you to take to get your son to where he will flourish. For you and your son to understand which of the many possible options are best, a psychological assessment will be necessary. You can explain to your son that this does not mean that anyone will want to push him from the path he envisions for himself, but to help him find the best approach to get on that path. Many professionals make use of tests to understand themselves better and better be able to manage themselves. But he is still nine, emotionally, so you need to be the mother and nudge him a bit, if he is afraid or disinterested. Note: Schizophrenia is related to high intelligence. For example, the twin of a highly intelligent person has schizophrenia more often than that of persons of average intelligence, and vice versa. The fate of your husband, who probably was highly intelligent as well, makes it important that you also consider the medical and psychiatric implications of high intelligence. I'd be very happy if you would come back and let us know how this all goes."
How much time is too much time playing educational computer games?,"The American Association of Pediatrics suggests 1-2 hours of all screen time--regardless of content.  The following link sites some of the effects it can have:  http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/children-and-tv/MY00522 Also, beginning more than 1-2 hours of screen time at age 3 makes it more difficult to limit it when they are older-as it becomes something they are used to doing for 3 hours a day (to pick a random amount of time) and don't necessarily know how or want to find a way to occupy themselves after school, for instance if they get used to it. Another study to read: http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/07/100706161759.htm
Although it is done on older children, habits are formed from an early age... and continue into adulthood.  So, it is better to be wary than to find out in 3rd grade that had you done something differently it might be different now.  Also, as one of the studies cited states: model good screen habits-don't spend too much time watching TV/playing video games either... that way as they grow up, they don't expect the amount of time to increase. I found one more link which specifically addresses tv, video games of educational varieties in toddlers (which, imho is closer to preschoolers than grade 5-but the grade 5 studies show what can happen if it continues)... http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/19/health/19babies.html
This study also says to limit it.  Note that the video industry says that a parent is the best judge... of course, they might just be biased (wanting parents $$?).  "
Exam results for 9-year-old do not reflect his real skills,"I've seen this a lot, both in my kids and in their friends.  My youngest went through this at the start of the year, and got a ton of help from his really excellent teacher on this - maybe that would be helpful here too.  All of the below is from that experience and from discussions with teachers on the subject - I'm not an education expert nor a child psychologist, but I am a very involved parent who usually talks to the teachers much more than average. In particular, from what I've been told when discussing this with teachers, it helps to recognize that not all of the skills you learn in school are ""reading writing arithmetic"" - in fact, in elementary school it's more important to learn the meta skills.  ""How to learn"", ""How to take an exam"", that sort of thing.  Once you learn those, you are set up for more success later. For my child, the teacher recognized early on that he was far ahead material-wise; he's in third grade, just turned 9, and tests a few grades ahead in terms of material.  But as you describe with your son, he was making skills mistakes, disorganized, and not good at explaining himself, along with poor handwriting for grade level. As such, she recognized that she needed to change the focus.  In his work, he received feedback based on how well he explained himself, on how well organized the answer was, and in particular on handwriting.  The concentration seemed to come along with this - I'm not sure if she specifically worked on it or not, but I suspect the focus on organization and explaining the answers helped that a lot.  Work with the teacher on this, and ask them if they can work with your son on these elements - and also explain to him why they're important. I found that he would check his work and sometimes correct mistakes during this process of explaining, and this might be the first place to start for your child.  If he's finishing first always, perhaps he should be going back and re-doing the problems.  Or, if he's just providing answers, he should add some explanation for how he gets to the answer in the exam (if that's not already asked).  Perhaps also explain how to check answers by reversing the problem - especially if he's making mistakes on things like addition/subtraction, those are easy to do (23+14=37; 37-14=23) or multiplication/division (9*5=45; 45/9=5). For very bright kids, it's pretty common to just write down the answers to the problems they know are easy, and not work them out.  That however leads to these silly mistakes.  19+43 = 52.  Right?  Of course, it's not... but it's easy to forget that carried ten.  Explaining how they do the math can help that, because either they show the carried 1 on the paper, or if they do it like I do in my head (43+20-1) they can write that down also - and maybe if they do it wrong (say 43+20=53-1=52) they might spot it on paper when they don't spot it in their head. Really anything he can do to slow himself down a bit will help - and also perhaps a talk about if he's feeling stress from the exam might also be worth having.  Does he have pressure to succeed on these exams, either internally or externally?  Does he feel like his self worth is defined by getting a good grade on the exam?  That can be tough for a 3rd or 4th grader, and it isn't necessarily anyones' fault - though as a parent it's always worth considering whether you're contributing to that positively or negatively.  I catch myself adding pressure sometimes to my kids, who frankly are doing far better in school than I have any right to complain about - but when you're ""smart"" you feel extra pressure to get even better results, and when your kids are ""smart"" you think they ought to get better grades, also... Perhaps if you talk to him about it, and see if he does have too much stress to perform well, it might help you find out if that's the issue. Some relevant reading, perhaps: on test anxiety, on gifted students testing poorly."
Should I stop pirating TV in order to better role model for my toddler?,"If you want her to have a strong moral compass, you'll have to explain (when she is old enough) why you do it and let her make up her own mind. As you say, a lot of people do it. Often, this means that a lot of people don't consider it to be much of a crime. That also means it's a very interesting way for children to learn about how to judge moral choices. When she's old enough, have a long discussion with her on why exactly it's illegal to pirate, on who it hurts, on what the consequences of pirating might be for the pirate, the creator of the content, and other people, on when it might be justified to pirate something and when it definitely is not, etc. You can't instill much of a moral compass if all you do around her is obey the rules without questioning them or talking about them or having an opinion about them. The fact that you pirate today means you clearly have an opinion on pirating. Denying your daughter the chance to talk about would be a wasted chance."
Is an expensive stroller worth it?,"Going through strollers for 5 kids (2 of which are twins), we've been learned quite a bit about what is good and what isn't. When it comes to price, here is what we've learned: A few additional stroller tips:"
How do you explain World War II to young children?,"The nice thing about one on one discussions versus a classroom lecture setting is that kids that age are pretty good about letting you know they've heard enough.  Start vague and answer his questions with more and more detail.  At some point his attention will start to wander, so you give him time to process it and he will ask again another day. I studied the holocaust extensively in extracurricular work when I was 13.  Even at that age, I understood what happened, but not why it happened or how it could have been allowed to happen.  I think the best you can explain about the ""why"" and ""how could it"" is something like: Hitler was a very bad man who thought
  of certain groups of people as no more
  than pesky bugs that needed to be
  squished.  Just like you have trouble
  believing it because it is so
  horrible, people at the time had
  trouble too, and Hitler was very good
  at tricking people into thinking
  otherwise.  Also, people tried a lot
  of diplomacy with Hitler at first
  because WWI was so bad they wanted to
  avoid another one if at all possible. 
  By the time they decided to stop him
  with war, Hitler was already powerful enough that it was very difficult to make him stop hurting people, even though they wanted to. Anything deeper than that I think you have to go with the lame parent excuse of, ""You'll understand when you're older.""   There are adults today who can't wrap their heads around it.  "
How can I potty train a 12-month-old?,"Many parents find that the ""elimination communication"" method, also known as 'natural infant hygene' is a simple approach. It is important to clarify that this approach is not 'potty training'. Rather, it is a two-way communication. Children know how to potty when they come out of the womb, and most will let you know. The basic principle of this approach is that children communicate when they need to go, and that the most difficult part of toilet training is un-training the diaper training. Typically, a parent waits for a child to finish pooping and then changes the diaper. This trains the child to poop in their diapers. But the fact that children pee when their diaper comes off may be evidence that they would prefer not to pee and poop on themselves. The 'elimination communication' approach starts when the child makes a pooping face - often when feeding early on. The parent removes the diapers and holds the child over a toilet. There are toilets that a 3 month old can use (figure 1). When the child poops/pees, the parent makes a 'cue' sound ('sss' = pee;  'mooo' = poo). The child learns to associate the sound with eliminating and will eventually learn to poop/pee when the sound is made. This approach focuses on communicating with the child and allowing them to put their waste in a receptacle. It is not important to catch all of the poops and pees, but it does reduce the number of wet or poopy diapers that that need to be purchased, changed, and discarded or washed. And when the child is old enough to go to the toilet on their own, it will seem natural to them it will not as necessary to train. "
When (if ever) is it appropriate to spy on your teenager's texts?,"Spying is a slippery slope.  It's so much easier for me as a parent to spy on my daughter (with things like txts, emails, phone logs, etc) than it would have been for my parents to spy on me.  That doesn't make it more right.   I have chosen to never do this.  I am quite sure she will make mistakes and stupid choices at some point, we all do, I just hope she makes mostly good choices, and can trust me to help her if she screws up.  I imagine if I was to spy she'd just be smart enough to delete her communications, and then she would in turn trust me less when she actually needs help... What is gained by that?"
How can my toddler learn to stay under the blanket at night?,"Until she was 5, my daughter would sleep on top of her blanket with her pillow on her feet. She knew about sleeping under the blankets (having seen us doing it), but just wasn't interested.  Dress them warmly and let them figure it out on their own."
How do you stop a child from using bad language and profanity?,"Definitely don't let it slide, but also don't overreact. We used a consistent timeout policy (warning, ultimatum, timeout) with our teenager when he was younger, and despite the fact that he cusses like there is no tomorrow with his friends now, he will almost never cuss in front of us. With our four younger kids, all under 6yo, we also use a consistent timeout policy. They have just discovered that ""poop"" and ""stupid"" get quite a rise out of many people, but we just model when appropriate use of those words are and discipline when they try to use those and other words inappropriately. Listening to a child use curse words is difficult, but if you emphasize it too much, it becomes more of a mysterious thing that they want to explore further (and will when you least want them to). Model good language, but also try to find the source of the bad language and eliminate it. Just to mention my philosophy on teenagers cursing amongst their friends, I think that many people fear that cursing teens will grow up to be criminals or thugs, but really cursing for teenagers is just another way of exploring vocabulary that they've (hopefully) been exposed to very little previously. I'm living proof that a teenager can go crazy with cursing in his younger years and still grow up to be successful. :)"
How to help my son to be himself?,"This really resonated with me. From my own experience, and speaking as someone who danced ballet for a number of years (in point shoes), wore girlish clothes and make up, etc... –– it's impossible to know who your son is going to ""be"" when he's an adult. People tried this a lot with me. It was always painful when I was sat down and given the ""talk"" that ""it's okay to be yourself and be gay."" (It is.) However, I wasn't gay. And when I told family/friends/teachers this, they laughed and said I was in denial. Everyone tried to tell me that I was gay, and so I began to believe it. Because of this, I dated NO ONE seriously or intimately until I was 25. You son is 8 years old. All his actions which seem like sexuality/gender defining things are just actions and things to him. Pink sparkly things are cool. Women's clothes are BY FAR more interesting visually than men's. That said, society will simply assign labels. It's what people do. It sucks. But the only label you need to worry about is being a parent to your son. You son will learn all about labels and what he wants assigned. I still wear pink underwear, but I like to have sex with women. I don't care if that confuses/upsets other people, who shouldn't be looking at my underwear anyway. But what I wear and what I do are my business. Your son's too. If he's confused by other people's actions/attitudes, it is your duty to explain why. And it's up to your son to decide how he'd like to be perceived. EDIT: I realize a big part of the question is a paraphrase for 'how to prepare your son for a cruel world.' The only thing you can do is tell the truth. His older brother is taking on this mantle and trying to protect his younger brother in the only way he knows how: to let him know what behavior is acceptable social standards. He isn't wrong. Children aren't complex. Society judges us all quickly with little regard for personal complexity. The older brother's reasoning is likely -- Behavior ""A"" == receive bullying; solution: stop behavior ""A."" Also, what I tried to illustrate from my own life is that sexuality isn't determined by any other action than sexual intercourse and what stimulates you to engage. At 8 years old, it's unlikely he has made any decisions regarding this. When your son is older and begins asking more questions regarding sexuality, the one conversation which helped me was with my (dearly departed) grandfather. When I was about 15, I asked him if I was gay. He very seriously responded with, ""when you walk into a room, who do you to look at more?"" My answer was ""girls, but I [dress the way I do and like makeup, ballet, etc.], and besides, what does that have to do with who I like to look at?"" His response, ""then who do you like looking at you?"" (Girls.) While it wasn't obvious at the time, it was a life-changing conversation in very cut-and-dried terms, which would echo into my future. Again I want to note that it was helpful to learn that my actions cast specific judgment on me, and yet I still found ways to rebel which make me happy being me. (Awesome pink underwear.) But I've also learned how to live in society and not aggravate total strangers or coworkers to irrational behavior. (More or less.) PS: I realize my answer now seems to have drifted from the question slightly, however, the OP originally tagged it ""homosexuality."""
What to do when a 6-year-old expresses suicidal thoughts?,"It's possible that she is just being dramatic and doesn't actually intend to hurt herself. If so, great, but there's likely still some truth to what she said: she feels like she isn't getting attention, and/or she feels like she isn't valued and loved. The fact that she's been increasingly sensitive to criticism indicates this if nothing else. However, it's also possible that she is truly depressed. Young children do attempt (and succeed at) suicide (ref. Suicidal Behavior in Children Younger than Twelve: A Diagnostic Challenge for Emergency Department Personnel) So be glad that she is reaching out for help, because it's a chance to figure out what's going on and intervene. Things I would do as soon as possible: Consult a professional. Don't dismiss this as ""just a phase."" A child psychologist knows the right questions to ask and what to look for. Regular appointments with a therapist can provide her a chance to talk with a non-critical adult (she can complain about your or her mother, for example, which she may not want to do to you directly) and a professional can teach coping techniques to help her deal with the root causes of low self worth. Talk to her. Be honest about why you want to have this conversation (""Child's mom heard that you told Child you're unhappy and you don't like yourself""). Offer her the chance to open up. Focus on your concern for her, and avoid any suggestion that she's done something wrong by sharing her worries, fears, and/or depression. Ask her what brings on those feelings of low self-worth. Be prepared to hear that it's something you do (my son gets intensely miserable and self-hating when he feels neglected), and be open to changing yourself. This doesn't mean you're a bad parent, or that this is all your fault (or all her mother's fault, or all whoever's fault), and blaming is counter-productive. Include other adults. Her mother needs to know about this. (Depending on your relationship, it could be a tricky conversation -- just avoid blaming and focus on your daughter -- but advice on that is outside the scope of my experience and this Answer.) Depending on how severe underlying issues are, teachers and school counselors may also need to be brought in (especially if there's a bullying or she's overwhelmed by schoolwork). Some general ideas for how to increase her sense of self-worth on an ongoing basis: Focus on positives. Praise effort, not ""her"" (for example, ""Great job on your homework, you clearly put in a lot of effort"" instead of ""Your homework is correct, you're so smart""). Thank her for doing chores or little helpful things around the house (""It's so helpful when you [set the table, tidy your room, fold your laundry]""), even for things that she is expected to do. Show your appreciation for the difference she makes in your life. Remind her she is loved. Hugs, praise, and including her in your life, both in special and everyday ways. Taking her out for a daddy-daughter dinner date is a great occasional treat, but everyday things are just as important. Ask for her help with miscellaneous tasks you're doing. Find age appropriate ways she can help, even if the overall task is not something you'd want a 6 year old to attempt solo. Listen to her. Pay attention to her interests.  Use constructive criticism. Kids need guidance and teaching, and we don't expect them to know everything. Unfortunately, some kids take this badly and as evidence that they Just Can't Do Anything Right. Focus on things she's doing right, concentrate on the goal, praise her effort and eventual success. Ask leading questions ""Hmm, is that the right way to do it?"" to help her examine the problem herself and self-correct, rather than you doing all the critiquing and correction. There are a couple other Questions that may be useful to look at:"
How do you respond when a child catches his parents having sex?,"If he is 12 then it is a PERFECT time to have the sex talks with him. When my boy was 4 he walked in on us in the middle of the night, should have still been asleep. He is now 12 and still remembers but he doesn't seem to be any more or less interested or disturbed about that subject matter than other kids his age. He talks about it as if it was mater of fact yet still treats it as a taboo subject like kids should. Not talking about it might have kept it ""exciting"" and that isn't what I think would have been best in that situation. We don't talk about it all the time, but when we do, I think it is easier to get to the heart of the matter with him. Now I have to worry about how to talk with my 7 year old daughter..."
How much pressure should I put on my kids to learn?,"There is an analog here, I think in focusing on anxiety to achieve specific external goals -- a high test score, a high GPA, a high SAT score, admittance to a prestigious university, etc. Pressure might (or might not..) make children anxious in working towards these goals. How would that anxiety affect them? 155 3rd and 4th graders were divided into low test-anxious (LTA), middle test-anxious (MTA), or high test-anxious (HTA) groups on the basis of scores on the Test Anxiety Scale for Children. Students were then tested in small groups on age-appropriate arithmetic problems either under time pressure typical of current achievement testing or under no time pressure. HTA boys displayed poor performance under time pressure compared to their less anxious peers yet improved significantly when time pressure was removed, with HTA and MTA boys matching the performance of LTA boys. LTA boys and HTA girls performed better under time pressure. (Source: Children's achievement strategies and test performance: The role of time pressure, evaluation anxiety, and sex) So as expected, anxiety generally has a negative effect on performance. But there's a huge divide in sex, at least in this study! High test anxiety girls performed better under time pressure, whereas HTA boys did not. And what determines whether a child has low, medium or high anxiety toward a test? Certainly parental pressure would tend to make them more anxious overall, but what if the child has a naturally relaxed personality? So already you can see the old adage being borne out, every child is different. As for the parents, perhaps the balance between internal (intrinsic) and external motivation is something to consider. There are tons of studies that document how dangerous it is for adults to focus on extrinsic goals; pursuing such goals often actively harms the much more powerful intrinsic motivations that drive people to succeed in life. When asked to write down their definitions of academic success, 56 percent of all parents' definitions included external standards like the following: performance beyond one's peers or attainment of socially recognized achievements such as college admission and employment in a high-status job. Emphasis on external standards may have its advantages, such as encouraging students to demonstrate high performance in school because it can lead to good grades and test scores, future college admission, and eventually employment in a prominent career. However, excessive or exclusive focus on these external indicators can pressure children, sending the message that academic success is important, not for personal reasons, but to please others. Although many of the parents evaluated academic success by external standards, one-half of this group simultaneously emphasized internal standards. In other words, they also defined academic success as relative to the individual: enjoyment, setting and attaining personal goals, motivation, working toward one's potential, being curious and inquisitive, and trying one's best. By emphasizing both internal and external standards of success, parents convey to their children that outstanding performance is important to success, but personal satisfaction and trying one's best are also important -- a balance that should help to alleviate feelings of pressure.

How can we discipline our toddler?,"From you description you are not doing timeouts right. I did the Supernanny method (not sure if she is known in your part of the world). 
Basic rules: After that the incident is over.  It is very important to follow through: once you gave a warning there is no way back. You have to be calm and don't get angry. But if warning worked just let it go. There are several things you are achieving when you do timeout this way: Also it looks to me that your child has a lot of energy:  going to the playground or park will take most of the energy out and also will give him the opportunity to do things he can't do at home.
Yes, it is difficult to get anything done with the toddler at home. That is why you have to help your wife with cleaning and cooking and don't assume that she can do everything just because she is at home all the time. "
How to deal with others' children who do not respect my authority?,"I'm sorry. My son (2 years) is one of the wild ones. He's rough, aggressive, has a high tolerance for pain, and is nearly fearless. What's more, he loves to break things, tackle people, wrestle, and test his limits (over and over).  I am sorry that he is jumping up and down on your son. I'm sorry that he just head butted your daughter in the face. I am not excusing his behavior; I'm apologizing.  Please don't be angry with him. I don't think it will help anything. Feel free to intervene. I don't want him to hurt your child. And he really doesn't either. He'll probably say that he's sorry if you give him a chance.  Here's a good strategy to deal with him. Approach the situation with his best interests at heart. Approach him with loving-kindness. Physically stop or prevent the wild or bad behavior. Don't display anger. Just separate him from your child and stand between them. He may think that you are joining in the rough-housing game he just invented. He might try to push you back (presumably you just pushed him to move him away from your child). Don't let that provoke you. Just expect it. You are doing exactly what he thinks is the funnest kind of play. Make it clear that you are not playing. Tell him, concretely, not to do the thing that concerns you. If you are not concrete he will not be able to follow your direction (even if he wanted to). He will likely cry for being admonished, for being prevented from playing the way he wants to, for being embarrassed in front of everyone. That's fine. That's part of the feedback loop he needs to learn not to do certain things. He may throw himself on the floor in a tantrum. Please try to catch him and prevent him from hitting his head on the ground.  You're going to have to do this over and over. I do this about 30-40 times an hour while I'm around him. Every day. Whenever he's awake. Don't ever hurt him. Don't scream at him. Don't intimidate or scare him.  Another thing to consider is, some of the times, letting him be wild with your child. There will be bumps and bruises, crying and fits. But there is a lot of evidence that both of these approaches are needed to let children develop the skills they need to thrive when they grow up."
How can I get my 4.5-year-old to stay in bed at bedtime?,"It's difficult for everyone when a child is fighting sleep. Everyone is tired, which makes it hard to be patient (for parents) or obedient (for children). Parents are desperate for even a few minutes of quiet, private, intimate time, and that time is quickly evaporating as the child keeps bouncing around. Recognize that alarm clocks and strict scheduling of life are not natural, and are particularly difficult for children to adapt to. (And for adults, too; how many of us love the snooze button?) Our ancestors usually slept until they were done sleeping, instead of letting a machine tell them when to wake up. Can you adjust your mornings to let people sleep as long as they want? Most people can't, but if you can... It's great that you have a rich bedtime routine. This ritual helps a child know what's going on. The world is a complex place, and a familiar routine can be reassuring. This will work greatly to your favor when your child decides to go along with your plan. And that will happen; this trouble will pass in time. Children aren't born knowing how to go to sleep. Falling asleep comes naturally, but putting yourself to sleep is a skill. I teach my children the ""three C's of going to sleep"":  (The 'q' is a joke that they can laugh at when they're older.) I've noticed that when a tired child does all 3 of these, they fall asleep very quickly. So teaching this lets them know what to do, and helps them recognize what they're doing that is preventing sleep.  Third, when I restless kid in the evening, I find it usually helps to snuggle up with the 
child. Kids love snuggles, so this is attractive to them, and gives them a reason to stay in bed. If a child continues to fight sleep, I am right there to remind them ""calm, quiet, and comfortable."" Having taught them the ""three C's"", that works better than ""stop hitting yourself; stop whistling; stop kicking the covers off."" Remember to take it easy on yourself. You will get through this. Good luck."
"Baby always rolling over and ending up sleeping on his stomach, is it dangerous?","According to the US. Department of Health & Human Services brochure on sleep positioning for infants: Studies show that, during early infancy, it is unusual for a baby who is placed in the back sleep position to roll onto his or her stomach.20 However, once infants are more developmentally advanced, they often roll over on their own. In this situation, when infants roll over on their own, there is no evidence that they need to be repositioned. The American Academy of Pediatricians's Task Force on SIDS published the following in Pediatrics in 2011 (emphasis mine): Parents and caregivers are frequently concerned about the appropriate strategy for infants who have learned to roll over, which generally occurs at 4 to 6 months of age. As infants mature, it is more likely that they will roll. In 1 study, 6% and 12% of 16- to 23-week-old infants placed on their backs or sides, respectively, were found in the prone position; among infants aged 24 weeks or older, 14% of those placed on their backs and 18% of those placed on their sides were found in the prone position.112 Repositioning the sleeping infant to the supine position can be disruptive and might discourage the use of supine position altogether. Although data to make specific recommendations as to when it is safe for infants to sleep in the prone position are lacking, the AAP recommends that these infants continue to be placed supine until 1 year of age. If the infant can roll from supine to prone and from prone to supine, the infant can then be allowed to remain in the sleep position that he or she assumes.  There is, however, no information regarding an infant who can roll over from supine to prone, BUT NOT from prone to supine. You should consult your pediatrician in this case. So the take-away from these expert sources is that you should always place a baby on his or her back to sleep. Once your baby can move allow your baby to sleep in whatever position he or she assumes. Just keep the crib mattress firm, the fitted sheet tight, and keep items other than your baby out of the crib."
How to help a tomboy not dread puberty,"First, puberty and all the emotions that go with it, include trepidation for even the ""girly-girls.""  The arrival of breasts is also highly troublesome for girls that do a lot of dancing (changes center of gravity and REALLY messes with spins and turns).  The whole thing has a lot of negatives for anyone that is choosing to look at it that way.  It might help her to know that even though she may be unique, her feelings aren't all that different from what some others are feeling too. Second, being an athletic girl, no longer really qualifies as being a ""tom boy.""  There are plenty of very ""feminine women"" as well that are highly athletic.  Instead of labels, start seeing your daughter as just being her wonderful, amazing and unique self.  It is the very best way you can help her do the same for herself.  Your attitude and thoughts about such ""labels"" will come through in how you speak with her about things as well as your actions, even if you never use the label directly with her.  Labels like ""tom-boy"" are highly limiting because they tend to psychologically put the person that believes they are the label into a ""box.""  Try thinking of her as a human being with a set of qualities - she is athletic as well as a few other things:  Highly intelligent?  Empathetic toward others?  Just and Fair?  Humerous?  I culled some of these qualities from your own question, so I understand you recognize them - but does your daughter?  Adolescents tend to put themselves in boxes where they think of themselves as ""fitting in"" and they need our help to be free of stereotypes and limitations.   None of the qualities you listed in your question are strictly ""male.""  Honor them as qualities rather than part of a label. One of the next best things you can probably do for your daughter is to look for adult role models she can look to as examples of women that took their femininity and embraced it while also succeeding athletically (ESPN's Top 40 female athletes).  What about the likes of Mia Hamm, Misty May Treanor, and Bonnie Blair?  Their breasts (and all that comes along with them) didn't get in their way - why should your daughters?  Start talking about them, watching biographical sketches and interviews, reading biographies . . . How did each of them use their femaleness to be better athletes and public figures at the same time.  She certainly isn't the first ""tomboy"" (if she must be labeled that way) to go through this and she won't be the last. I seriously would like to stress taking a look at these women as feminists as well as athletes.  Try to look at the advancements women have and are making in the world of sports. For example, check out this article about baseball and women in it today - in professional baseball.  Puberty does not mean the end and she needs reassurance that it doesn't mean the end for her.  Yes, it is a fight, but check out this list of women's firsts in sports - everyone of them was up against nay-sayers that thought women weren't strong enough or focused enough, or (whatever) enough because they were women.  Don't teach her to buy into it!   My Grandmother desperately wanted to play baseball and wasn't allowed to at all.  Instead of a ball and bat for her tenth birthday (what she wanted) she got a doll.  She tore its head off and used it as a ball and used the body for the bat so she could practice in secret.  In fact, you might even take a look at history and see how far we've come in general - let alone sports.  It used to be standard belief that men had mental advantages in terms of their workforce abilities and that was why women should be kept at home - bah!!  Make sure she knows who Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Sojourner Truth are (among others) and what they were up against (especially Sojourner Truth!).  Yes, there are biological advantages for the boys in terms of musculature - so what!  Maybe she is smarter and more driven - that matters too.   In regard to friends - she can still hang with the guys (I did) there is a lot less drama with them.   While I wasn't passionate about sports, all my friends were guys (I think I had one girlfriend) and I can say from first experience that doesn't have to end either.   This is an exciting time for women in sports - get her excited about the prospects of being a part of it**!  Maybe she'll make a little history of her own while making things even better for all the girls to come after her."
At what age can you leave the child in the bathtub?,"The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends the age of 4 before children are allowed to bathe alone; a quick Google search will tell you that many parents start around that age. However, usually parents who leave their kids alone make sure that they have no music on and can hear the child clearly wherever they are. They also check in on the child every few minutes. As a parent, I am sure you'd agree that if the kid is making noise, it's probably fine. I wouldn't recommend going to answer the phone — it is quite distracting and you can ""forget"" about how quickly the time passes or fail to realize that your child is no longer making noise. Also, note, that children are quite capable of turning the water tap on (unless it is really high or something). They might not know how to stop it or be too scared (suppose if they turned on scalding hot water). As a personal story: my mother left our 14-month old daughter in the bathroom alone. My mother had just finished bathing her and clothing her, when she realized that she had forgotten her diaper. She went to get her diaper - and did nothing else - to come back to find that our daughter had locked herself in the bathroom. Our bathroom is quite small, and the vanity drawers, when open, prevent the bathroom door from being opened. Our daughter had closed the bathroom door (she does that sometimes) and then proceeded to open the vanity drawers. Our daughter freaked out because she could not get out anymore, and all we could see of her was from a tiny little crack. She is well aware on how to close the drawers (on a normal day anyway), but she was scared enough that she just stood there and did nothing. It took us a full 15 minutes to make our way in to get her out. Had she been old enough to get in and out of the tub, or to turn the water on, she easily could have drowned or seriously injured herself. Kids do the darnest things and get into the strangest messes. Don't test them. No phone call, not even the one to tell you that you've won a million dollars, is worth your child. "
How to explain to your child why a grandparent isn't around,"I feel for you, I had a bad relationship with my father for a long time. Fortunately we managed to patch it up but that's not always in the cards.  I wouldn't sugar coat too much or lie to your child. He's asking a fair question and it deserves an answer. Life doesn't always work out how we want and he's going to have to learn that sometime. That doesn't mean you have to tell the unvarnished truth either, you may want to take the really hard edges off in places. Talk about your feeling about it.  What I would think is most important is what you say after you tell him about your father. You are about to tell him that not everyone had a father that cares about him and he may worry about him and you. Make sure he knows you care about him, and that the same thing isn't going to happen to you two. Maybe do something fun with him to reinforce that. "
5yr old Addicted to Mobile Devices - Need Advice!,"I completely agree with you about it being the challenge for this generation. In my classroom I used to have to teach low-functioning children how to do tasks and to increase their attention span. I am not saying your child has a intellectual problem, but that the way to increase attention span might work for this as well. We used a three token system. When the child earned three tokens they bought time for their chosen activity (freetime). Each token represented a work task, in the beginning -- very short tasks of less than a minute each. (If, the child did the work of course.)  The three tokens never changed but the length of the tasks did -- gradually over time. So in the beginning of the school year a child might work for 4 minutes and then play for 15, but at the end of the year, they'd be working for an hour and earning the same 15 minutes. At five, tokens might not be your preference, but the core of the idea still works. He earns time by accomplishing the other things you want. You subtly increase the accomplishments and decrease the earned device time. That might work best by not actually decreasing the set time earned  on the device. The earned time is always the same amount -- whatever you decide -- but the 'work' time is longer and longer. At five he understands choices and consequences. I suggest that you tell him that every time he asks or bugs you for the device, he adds a task to the 'work' side. Be careful though -- if the 'carrot' gets too small, he won't do the things you want. (Do not reduce the earned time.) As for TV and so on at dinner -- if you as a family watch TV or Youtube over dinner and you are thinking this isn't great -- make dinner time device free for all of you. It's really only 15-20 minutes. The only excepts are emergencies... and parents cannot 'cheat'. Talk about your day. This is a great time to talk about family matters. (Finances, goals and so on.) Model the behaviour you want. If Mum or Dad is always on the computer, phone or whatever -- then you cannot blame the child  for copying you. You also model earning time. You do your chores and contributions and you earn free time to spend as you choose. Use language that shows your son that you also have stuff to do before you can play. Don't complain. We all have things we have to do to keep our homes and family working. You do not want to teach resentment or make looking after family look like a chore.  I also suggest that you do homework as a family. I resented being sent to my room, so we all sit at the dining room table and work for the time it takes to get homework done. Reading a book is fine. It's quiet time but your child can ask questions and you can comment on the book you are reading or the sketch you are drawing.  Your motto becomes: ""This is what we all do to make our family work."""
How can a young child be taught not to bully?,"When you are talking about babies and toddlers, bullying is a lot simpler than it can be with older children.  At this age, it's pretty much one of three scenarios: Someone taught the child bullying behavior. If the child's parents encourage the behavior, it's unlikely you'll be able to un-teach it.  Better to just stop spending time with that family.  If it was something picked up at daycare, etc. and the child has been removed from the source, continue per below. The child gets something he/she wants through bullying behavior. The child doesn't grasp that the behavior is naughty. In either of these cases, normal behavior modification techniques (details below) are the answer.  Children under two generally can't grok (I tried to find a source to link, but all the good studies seem to be paywalled) that others have feelings.  A ten-year-old can look at the child they hurt and see the effect on that child.  An 18-month-old likely isn't yet at the level of cognitive development to do that.  If it gets them attention, or a toy the smaller child had, or a feeling of control, they will repeat the behavior over and over.  So, that leaves the question of how to fix it... Watch closely.  Until the behavior has been ended, don't leave the little ones alone.  Every time the behavior repeats without immediate consequence, it is reinforced.  (By the same token, you can never let it go because it's ""not that bad yet"" etc. -- that teaches that the behavior is okay.) When the child does something inappropriate, the nearest adult should immediately pick him/her up and return anything he/she has taken to the other child.  (Hint: if the smaller child is already hurt, you have probably waited too long.) In a firm, low voice, tell the child ""No. We do not $whatever.  That is naughty.""  And plunk him/her in time out, then walk away.  Everyone should basically pretend the naughty kid isn't there.  Even looking directly at him/her is attention that reinforces the behavior.  1.5 - 2 minutes is a good length of time-out for a child that young. Lavish attention on the younger child, make sure he/she is having fun without the bully (and more importantly, the bully learns that time-out is a not-fun place, and being out there is fun). When the time-out is over, the person who put the naughty child in time out should pick him/her up (make eye contact at eye level) and repeat what the child has done wrong, and have him/her apologize.  If the child is not yet verbal, use the sign for ""I'm sorry"": the right fist circled over the heart one time.  Demonstrate if this is new, but the child does not get out of time-out without an apology to the child he/she was bullying.  (Hugs are good, too) Let the kids try playing together again, and if it's going well, make sure there is lots of positive attention for both. This will take a while to work -- first, the 18mo has to grasp that the consequence is causally linked to the behavior; then he/she will test different behaviors to see which ones get a time-out; finally, he/she will experiment with not getting caught and/or test occasionally after the lesson is learned just to see if anything has changed. You'll note that this is a little different than the normal time-out routine I recommend for older children (2+), in that there is no warning.  This is because a lot of 18mo (I'd guess most of them) don't grasp punishments that are separated, even a little, from the behavior that prompts them.  The no-warning approach is also good for 2yos that have trouble connecting it all, though almost all older 2yo kids and 3-and-ups will grasp it and should get warnings."
How to deal with a teenage daughter who refuses to dress modestly,"There are at least 2 sides to every issue.  There are also at least 2 sides in every war.  By destroying what she considers hers b/c she did not comply with your orders, in her eyes, the ""issue"" has become a ""war"" and you launched the first nuclear weapon, but it was a dud. Did you change her mind? No. Did you adjust her clothing style? No. (She will find a way around draconian methods of control.) Did you achieve anything you wanted? No. So what can be answered with ""Yes""? Is she now pitted against you? Yes. Does she now know to hide everything she does from you? Yes. Will she trust the most stupid person in the world instead of you? Yes. She is not a toddler -- she's a young adult.  She violated no laws and was conforming to what she perceived as the standards for her generation.  You distanced yourself from her and, in her eyes, from her generation.  The chasm has been declared. Is all lost?  I am grateful to say resolutely, ""No."" Our daughters are and will always be our babies... whether they're 4 months, 4 years, or even 44 years... we'll remember every nuance (as we ought). They clearly change over time, sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse, but as parents we must always be there for them -- in the good and bad.  So you disagree with her choice of clothing -- does it really matter?  So you disagree with her hair style -- does it really matter?  So you disagree with her choice in _ _ _ issue -- does it really matter? At her age you can give advice, suggest alternatives, help with her thought process, and support her growth, but control, dictatorship, supremacy is no longer yours to be had.  She is a free-willed spirit now, beyond your control in anything but the minor issues. Women voting?  Non-whites speaking as free people?  Indentured persons being treated as equals?  Just decades ago, the answer to those questions would be, ""Are you crazy!?"" If I had made a mistake as significant as yours, I would sit down with her, apologize, tell her the reasons, accept my error, and correct it... and then make damn sure she knows that I am willing to do so because I care about her so much (and for that very same reason I took the initial actions.)  It will show what a true adult will do: admit their mistakes and take responsibility for it. If you don't (as is your choice), then you are choosing to accept the consequences of a daughter who will no longer be with you in spirit, but still serve as your daughter. Since your actions serve no constructive end, please ask yourself this: Did I raise a slave? If the answer is ""No"" (it is a firm ""No"" to her!), then your choice has been laid out before you to make. 4745 Greater than the number of days she will be under your control and a timer to when her control over her life without any non-legal interference begins. While you were reading this, that number got smaller."
"I want my son to tuck in his school uniform shirt, but he does not want to. What can I do to get him to always tuck it in?","You have already seen that you cannot make him do it. So what can you do? There are two distinct goals in your question: You want your son to learn dressing appropriately, and you want him to tuck in his shirt. I think the former is the one that is actually important. So the objective is that your son understands what messages we communicate through our clothing choices in various social situations, and can use this communication channel. A great thing you can do towards this objective is having open conversations about dress codes (in a general sense). An open communicate goes both ways, this is not you explaining to him what is right and what is wrong. This is you explaining your views, and dress codes you are familiar with, but also you listening. How are 14 year olds dressing these days, and why? How does different clothing indicate group membership, etc? You want this conversation to be non-adversarial, and ideally connecting. Can you find common ground? Some fashion you both detest? Some actor in a movie that you both agree dresses totally awesome? Hopefully, this will get you to the point where you can talk about clothing choices in terms of ""what are the norms for the given context?"" and ""what do I want to communicate with my clothing?"", rather than mere ""proper"" vs ""improper"" terms. It is highly plausible that your teenager will occasionally want to communicate attitudes you wish he wouldnt, but as long as he is aware of what he is doing, he can code-switch when needed. [Example: Wearing your trousers at knee-level when hanging out with friends vs doing so at a job interview.] Ultimately, you will probably have to compromise. Your son is quite likely the better judge of how dress codes work in his friendgroup (at least after having examined this a bit). If ""shirt is not tucked in"" is an important component of ""I'm cool enough to hang with you guys"", then that's how it is. On the other hand, if you trust his judgement here, you are in a good position to ask that he in turn believes you for stuff like ""having your shirt tucked in when we visit Aunt Judy is an essential part of showing her baseline respect""."
Two year old son sometimes using female verb endings - grammar issue?,"Important caveat: I don't speak a word of Russian, so I'm using Google Translate for my examples. I own a cat. Naturally, we always refer to the cat by her name rather than as ""cat"", so my son has made the logical assumption that all cats are called [CatName]. So, when we are out and about and he spots some random cat and says ""[CatName]"", my response is to say ""That's right [Son], that's a cat"", because I know what he means, I'm just correcting him at the same time. Therefore I suggest you do the same with verb forms. This is where my non-existent Russian knowledge comes into play: If you son says ""
я сделала..."" (""I've made..."" with the feminine suffix), you can respond with ""That's right, ты сделал (you've made, masculine suffix)..."". This way you affirm and praise him for what he did, whilst also providing an example of the correct way to say the phrase."
How do I approach my 13-year-old daughter's confusion regarding her sexuality?,"Is the psychological therapy a direct result of only this event? To an outsider without more information, that sounds like more than necessary. Your daughter's therapy is private but you should take the opportunity to discuss your role with the therapist. Get an urgent appointment with the therapist and get professional advice on how to handle the situation as an involved parent. There are things you can do, separately from managing the immediate crisis you are facing. Most importantly, show her that you love her and that you support her unconditionally. Her sexuality as well as every other detail that makes her her does not change that you're her loving parent and you want to help her be a wonderful person. Try to support her in a way that she best likes (don't bulldoze over her with your own style). Give her hugs and support if she needs it. Give her space and quiet if she prefers that. Also, we have a few related questions on this site, and this answer in particular seems useful."
What can we do? Teacher assigned a book that will be too upsetting to our child because of the anxiety she’s facing during the pandemic,"First, a note: I am not speaking to whether this is a correct choice on your part on her behalf; I would encourage you to ask that as a separate question. If you have concerns about a particular assignment, you have a few options.  Your first and best option is to speak to the child's teacher.  Bring up your specific concerns, as to why you believe this will negatively impact your daughter.  This is the best option, both because the teacher is the person who can most easily change the assignment to a different one, and because the teacher can give you information as to what else to do if the teacher cannot modify the assignment (such as due to curriculum requirements). If this does not work, and you still want to pursue this, you should then follow up with school administration - usually the principal or similar role depending on the school.  This person nominally supervises the teachers, and may be able to override curriculum requirements.  Beyond the principal is usually a school board or similar governmental body; I don't recommend going that high, as they aren't really suited to handling individual student needs. A different route would be to consult your child's medical professional, particularly if she is seeing a therapist, psychologist, or psychiatrist.  If she is in such severe state as you describe, I hope she is; if she isn't, please consider having her see one.  A medical professional such as these would be able to discuss the issue with you, and if they agree that the book is harmful to her condition, could write a letter to the school informing them that in their medical opinion this would be harmful.  At that point, the school would be required to make a reasonable accommodation (in most countries). Either way, though, I think the teacher is your first point of contact.  I as a parent try to have a good relationship with my children's teachers, and one of the advantages of doing so is precisely this: being able to talk to them about concerns I have, and having them be addressed.  They're human, and they can understand issues like this; they might not agree, or might not be able to, depending on restrictions placed on them, but they can at least empathize and give you tips for how to proceed if they're unable to help you."
At what age should a child be introduced to the Television?,"According to the AAP not until two. In fact, the American Academy of
  Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that
  children under two years of age avoid
  watching TV entirely. Experts say that
  babies and young toddlers see
  television as a confusing array of
  colors, images and noises. Children
  under age two won’t understand much of
  the content they see on TV and it
  takes time away from more productive
  exploring, such as interacting with
  others. The reality though is that this can vary. While recommendations exist; reality also exists. If under the age of two limit exposure as much as possible."
At what age does a toddler stop being a toddler?,"I don't think there's a universal definition. Going by the American Academy of Pediatrics: Clothing manufacturers, on the other hand, consider toddlers from 2 - 4, which is why you see 2T - 4T clothing sizes.   I would say the real test is based on developmental milestones rather than age.   A child is a toddler once they begin walking/toddling around, and ceases to be a toddler when they have met a number of milestones such as communication, toilet training, and motor skills."
How do I teach my baby to not touch my computer?,"While I agree with Torben's answer, the core of this question applies to situations other than just working vs. babysitting. Sometimes a parent may want to check email, do some shopping, or participate in a wonderful online parenting question and answer community.  The issue of a baby wanting to play with technology isn't just limited to computers/laptops/tablets.  A smartphone can easily fall into the same category, particularly if, like me, you use it to show your child entertaining and/or educational vidoes, or play music.  It becomes much less of a clear-cut issue when it comes down to ""how can I answer a phone call without my child demanding to play with the phone?"". While it is still true that the baby needs more attention than you might give to such tasks, including phone calls, there are still situations where it may be very valid to want to use these things in front of a child.  For example, when my wife and I are both with my son in the living room, one of us can surf the internet or do work while the other keeps our son entertained, and we prefer to have us all together as a family rather than have one of us have to leave the room. So, how do you actually handle this without it becoming an issue? One possible solution is to give your child their own version of the item to play with. I'm not suggesting you get your child a laptop, or buy them their own iPad.  However, there are plenty of toy laptops and cell phones that are age-appropriate.  Children love to emulate their parents, which is probably why your son is so intent on playing with your laptop.  Giving him his very own laptop will not only channel that energy into something that he can't damage (okay, a 10 month old can probably damage anything up to and including diamond, but at least we're talking a plastic toy that is easy to replace!), it also lets him feel like he's ""being just like mommy/daddy"". This can be extended to lots of other items.  Toy lawnmowers, ovens and cooking sets, car toys that have steering wheels, etc..     If you don't want to/can't invest in child versions of every item that you don't want him playing with, the only other options I can think of at that age are to either have something else that the child will see as ""better"" (which can be difficult, given how quickly ""favorites"" change at that age, coupled with the fact that the item in question is forbidden may only make it even more attractive), or, as Torben suggests, keep anything you don't want him playing with entirely out of sight."
Why should children be rewarded for good behaviour?,"They should be rewarded for good behavior in the process of learning the good behavior. Then after a while when the child understands that the ""good behavior task"" is expected, you can gradually stop rewarding for that behavior. It is important that this kind of rewarding is just praising, and not giving gifts like toys or treats as rewarding. I don't consider star charts as gifts, because this is more symbolic action that is a more of a practical praise method than just telling. While doing this, you must at the same time make sure they understand that it is the way to behave, and take discipline action if they don't behave as expected. You said: Is it better to limit rewards to behaviour that exceeds expectations? Yes, but when you think about it, behavior that we normally expect to be the normal behavior, will always have to be learned by the children. Until the child have learned it, it is not understood to be expected from the child's point of view, and praise needs to be given when doing things that has not yet become a natural part of what the child understands to be expected."
How to remove Toddler's attraction for iPhone /iPad?,"First, set up ground rules about how much he can play on these devices each day and be clear with him about them. Next, in order to help you follow through with your rules, lock your IPhone/IPad with a password.  That way, you won't have to worry about hiding your devices from him, plus this will help accustom him to being in the same room as your ipad without being able to play with it.  Here's how to do this:   Also, be sure to follow through on your rules.  When he wants to use it, tell him ""Ok, you can use it until x O'clock"".  As that time approaches, give him fair warning so he can finish up what he is doing.  Once his time is up take your device away from him.  He might put up a stink but stick to your guns and eventually he'll learn to accept it. Last, when he sees you using it and wants a turn, remind him that his time for the day is up.  This will likely be tough for the little guy, so you may want to gradually ramp up your use in front of him.  However, if you stand firm, eventually he'll eventually learn to share, and that is a very valuable life lesson :)"
How do we teach a pre-schooler about money and shopping?,"I suggest a simple habit. Never buy toys on impulse; no matter how difficult the merchandizers make it for us. (Toys in the check out lane, really?) Each time explain that the child can think about getting the toy and give reasons on the following day. Let them know that if you approve of the reasons, on the next trip to the store you will get the toy if they remind you.  All of the above hinging on their ability to hold the desire for the toy over time.  Remember to demonstrate this in your own behavior. This is primarily for combating impulse buys. Budgeting and scarcity will necessarily be handled differently. But if you are not truly in a financial bind, avoid making your child feel an imagined/false financial insecurity. They don't need that added stress."
How can I motivate my 16 yo daughter to do something valuable with her life?,"The thing to worry about most is poor performance at school, only because that has the possibility of really cutting off her options in the future. One question you might ask yourself is why she isn't interested in other things. Rather than complain--which clearly isn't helping--do what you can to start a dialog. What is she getting out of facebook? Do her friends have similar performance at school? Why is she interested in Tumblr? Are there things she is interested in?  You might also consider that social networking is a sort of addictive behavior, and it is hard to give up something that keeps triggering your reward centers. She needs to find something else to trigger good feelings, and complaining at her isn't going to help her do that. If you feel like she needs time away from pretty much everything social network related, is there something that she would like to do to do that? When one of my younger cousins was feeling similar ennui, I recommended that she go on an Outward Bound expedition (and argued her parents into paying for it). She came back feeling empowered and started taking control of her future. She was a little more defiant, actually, but she was defiant in better directions--she gave up the violin, which she hated, and started focusing on academics and physical fitness, which she loved. You could send your daughter on a sailing or mountaineering course in late July... she wouldn't have internet access for three weeks. That might help her clear her head and give her a chance to think by herself for a while, which may be exactly what she needs."

How can I teach my child not to be greedy?,"Show them how to have fun without gifts/stuff What did I enjoy most when I was a child? Going camping: making fires and climbing trees. At home it was Lego, or those wooden railways. My sister and I would make a layout and then play make believe games with the little people. p.s. I am only 18, so it's not like this harks back to another time, this is possible now with the right attitude. Also, Don't tolerate greediness Chastise your children for wanting gifts. It is a bad trait, although it is NOT their fault. Do not say that they are bad, just say that they shouldn't expect such things and let them find or show them something else fun to do. People want things for a reason, most often boredom, but also social acceptance (everyone else has it). I think limited 'everyone else has it' cases should be tolerated, but if you can find other activities that are fun then they will be too busy to bother about stuff."
What to do when parents disagree regarding their parenting,"How to disagree and still come to an amicable resolution (aka Negotiating for Parents 101) Péter Török makes good points about each parent explaining the impact of certain decisions on the family. I am going to elaborate on Swati's note to pick your battles. In our house, when things become contentious, there are usually three types of dispositions on an issue: When the mix is neutral/neutral, then it's not an issue. Our kids don't take music lessons because neither one of us cares enough about it. No problem. When the mix is important/important or opposed/opposed, we both care and are in complete agreement so there is more consistent follow-up. For example, we both think it's important that our kids can swim. So, the kids are always at their lessons and it doesn't get forgotten. Another example, the rule in our house is that ""you hit; you sit"". Crime and punishment are both clear by both parents. When the mix is important/neutral, generally the person with interest takes the lead. For example, it's important to me that clothing be put away. So I take charge of that. Sometimes I enlist the help of my spouse, but generally he is not leading that task.  This is when explaining how doing this task impacts me and the family has the best results. One of us gets talked into caring. Re-motivation is required because there are more slip-ups. The parent who cares generally needs to ask for help when they want it. Arguments happen when the mix starts involving opposition. The violent TV/movie issue is a good example. This is where we start invoking veto power. Either parent has the right to forbid something that they think is wrong. This is a firm ""drawing line in the sand"" kind of approach and is used rarely. Restricting is easier to enforce than banning because as your children mature you can loosen the restrictions. The things that are banned in our house are banned for everyone (i.e. smoking). Another example is helmets: ""thou shalt not ride a bike without a helmet""...until you are legally responsible for yourself; same rule applies for parents. Note that these examples don't involve life-saving decisions, like blood transfusions or transplants or surgeries. This is where you and your spouse have hopefully discussed your values and come to terms with your differences before deciding to (marry and) have children. For contentious issues, trying to go about the decision logically rather than emotionally helps. Then when you still have a problem, the person opposed can feel better about agreeing to what previously unthinkable. A good book on negotiating that fits most situations that don't involve money is ""Getting to Yes"". Law schools use it. The premise is that there are 4 elements to negotiation and how you should deal with them: People:      Separate the people from the problem.
Interests:   Focus on interests, not positions.
Options:   Generate a variety of possibilities before deciding what to do. Criteria:    Insist that the result be based on some objective standard Most of all, regardless of the situation, be sure to address the idea and not the person. If you can avoid personal attacks, finding a mutually agreeable solution is more likely."
How to help children cope with a parent's suicide?,"I have no idea what any kind of ""best"" action could possibly be. What I would want to make sure of is that no matter what interaction I have with my kids about the death of their other parent I want to be clear what is happening inside me (and deal with that) from what is happening inside them (and help them deal with that). They are two different aspects of what's happening and they're easy to mix up... I would want to make sure I get lots and lots and lots of support from friends that I trust know how to listen - and I mean REALLY listen the way I like to be listened to. That means people who can sit in silence while I open my heart and who don't give me lots of advice as to how I can 'fix' myself (like they think I'm broken???) nor do they try to shut me down (you know, stuff like - ""there, there, I'm sure it will be OK"" - when of course I can't possibly see that). I want support from people who know how to listen and can help me validate what's going on in my world because that will help ground me (life for example the friend who can hear how upset I am and say to me - ""Shit... you must be really, really bent outta shape about this... you must be lost and confused...""). After I get to talk to these kinds of people every day as long as I need it, then I'll have some kind of space to sit with my kids and offer them the same... When I sit with my kids I'd really want to offer them something they're not likely to get from the rest of their world - a space to just be themselves - whether that's really upset, really sad, really confused, or numb... And I'd want to listen and validate what's going on for them. I'd want to be super honest with them about what's going on for me (""wow... when I hear you say how confused you are I get all torn up inside. I know how tough it is for me and imagining that it's going on for you it must be even tougher...""). I'd sometimes get ideas about advice or things they can do to make things ""better"" - and I'd want to hold off sharing any of those things until I'm completely sure they've shared all they want to share with me. And then I'd ask if they'd like to hear of an idea I have that might help them. And if they said ""No"", I'd respect that and bring it up again later if it was still important to me or drop it if it wasn't relevant then. And if they said ""Yes"", I'd share my idea and ask them what they thought about it - and I'd listen again for what's going on inside of them. My son is now 18 and he went through about 6 years that were pretty black and dark and tough for him. I found out he was really depressed and had a lot of suicidal thinking. He was living for a lot of that time in another country with his mother and when we talked on the phone and I asked how things were he didn't share with me the dark stuff. Last year he moved in with me and we began talking a lot about how things were for him. Now, after about a year with me listening to him in this way, he's a lot more open and shares a lot more of what's going on inside of him. He's faced a lot of what terrified him around other people and especially meeting new people and especially meeting young women he was attracted to. He shares these things now very openly and he seems genuinely much happier..."
What can I do to a 6-month-old child so she ends up smart and has a high IQ?,"At six months old, the key is to talk a lot, and to give the baby lots of opportunities to explore their environment. One approach that worked well for us was to follow the Montessori approach to organizing our house and what our children played with. One example for that approach is on this site, which gives a good overview of the concepts.  Key things to consider: This is a key time to help develop her mind and body, and take advantage of every minute you have with her.  Don't focus on ""IQ"" - and these wouldn't be any different for any child, no matter their potential.  Focus on interacting with her and giving her as much stimulation as she wants, and she'll be well set up for success!"
How to get toddler to eat eggs?,"Let him help prepare the eggs with you.  That way, he can be part of the process of making the food itself, and can see where everything comes from.  He can also suggest ridiculous ingredients (Honey! Cheerios! etc) and see where those experiments take him.   We sat our toddler up on the counter and let him see the entire process of making the eggs.  He was much more interested in both the preparation and the eating once he got involved in the process, rather than just having them appear in front of him.  Yes, it's definitely messier-- especially now that he wants to crack the eggs himself-- but just have some towels and the like on hand to clean up, and you should be fine."
"Can I ""read"" from English books to my infant, but use words from my native language?","I have personally tried this. The only difficulty that I've found is that once your child reaches ""reading age"", these books can offer some starting points. However, if your child has consistently heard you say ""chat"" on a specific page, but the letters written are ""cat"", it'll pose a hurdle. Incidentally, I also initially did this with all the books that use ""he"" for unnecessarily gendered characters, where I read ""she"" instead. This posed the same ""memorization"" issue. Kids remember the words you say, and as they ""read"" the books in their early learning stages, they'll be repeating the words they know by heart. Because of this, when the letters on the page don't match, there's confusion and possibly annoyance. Of course, there's always Google Glass, which can change the words in real-time using augmented reality... but maybe a bit overkill. ;) Edit: I forgot to add, that I think your idea of rewriting the text in the book in your native language is a good idea. Use masking tape to fully cover over the words and write clearly so that it can be legible to your child as a young reader."
How to stop my preschooler from constantly running away,"To me, this is where punishment-centric parenting doesn't really work well.  It is indeed difficult to come up with good, immediate consequences or punishments that are directly related to the action (""Natural consequences""-based punishments), and other punishments at this age don't usually work very well. I see the issue as straightforward.  She doesn't understand that it is unsafe and inappropriate to go away from you or to go into a neighbor's yard.  If you teach her this, she will stop doing it.  And yes, this is possible - at a much younger age than that, even. My three year old and almost-two year old are given nearly free reign - we walk up the street without holding hands except at street corners, and my three year old reliably stops on every single corner if he gets a bit ahead of me (when it's me and the two of them, this happens periodically).  Occasionally he gets more ahead than I feel comfortable with, at which point I tell him that; he reliably stops when I ask. No, he's not a quiet child or a compliant child.  He's a rambunctious ball of energy who is very loud and runs around all the time, and in a safe environment like home he's a holy terror as often as any other child (or more!).  But we've taught him how to behave in these areas, because we gave him the necessary information, reinforced why he needs to do these things, and hold him to that level of responsibility. Some of this was easier to do as a younger child (ie, 1-2), and so for a 4 year old won't be as easy; but it should be possible.  This is largely what we do now (but adapted for 4yo reasonable limits). In either of the above cases, let her know that a further issue will mean she needs to hold your hand for a while.  Don't put this as a punishment, though.  It's necessary for her safety.  Explain why - she should be old enough to understand that being hit by a car is bad, that being lost is bad. Repeat this explanation each trip, and after the first time, encourage her to give you the reasons why.  My three year old can tell me why he shouldn't run off, and clearly understands it well.  He didn't at 1, but by 2 he started to understand, and was able to walk without holding hands.  (My second was even younger, but he's both more compliant and has a good example to follow.) It's important to keep this in the forefront: this is not a punishment. This is doing what needs to be done to keep her safe.  If and when she can prove to be safe without holding your hand, she doesn't have to.  For my older son, this is usually a very short time: if he's running off, it's because he's out of control.  Once he is back in control, we let him go, assuming he doesn't immediately run off again. You also should make it clear to her that as she proves herself capable of walking with you in control and within a reasonable distance, that distance will increase, because you'll feel safe with her being further away.  There are certainly times when my almost-2 year old doesn't get to walk without holding my hand, and some streets where he has to walk ""inside"" of me (away from the street) because they're too busy (though we plan walks to be on quiet residential streets whenever possible).  This will be less true as he gets older, and his older brother is much more free to walk on his own than he is. For the specific climbing into the neighbor's yard, the issue is the same - she needs to know why it's not okay, and she also needs to know how to make it okay. I would talk to her about why it's not okay; write out ahead of time all of the reasons.  There are two major sets in my mind: safety, and propriety. Then, find out why she's going over there.  Possible reasons: The first one may not be fixable, but you can make an effort to go out to parks more often.  The second? Get better toys (perhaps by selling the current ones to pay for them, or doing some chores or otherwise helping to make the money).  The third can be addressed by setting up playdates.  The last, get a playgym for your backyard, go to parks, etc. Additionally, you can let her know what she should do if she wants to go over there.  Instead of just going over (in which case it's a problem for reasons above), ask you.  Tell her why you may or may not say yes - for example, you may need to call your neighbor and ask if it's okay to go.  Show her how to do this with your cell phone, so she feels in some control (but remind her you need to be involved).  Your neighbor may not be there.  Your neighbor may have friends over.  Make sure she understands the answer will sometimes be no - but also sometimes yes.   Finally, if this doesn't help, you will need to restrict her leaving your sight until she can be trusted not to leave; again, this is for safety reasons, and not a punishment- just a fact.  If she can't stay inside the backyard without being watched, then she can only go out when you can afford time to watch her.  If she can't even stay in the house without leaving, then she has to stay in the room you're in; or get better locks for the doors that she can't operate (or get one of those chimes retail stores sometimes have that alert you when the door is opened).  This won't be easy for you, but there's not much you can do - except help her learn why it's a safety issue.  Then loosen the restrictions when it is safe to do so; don't make a big deal of it, just tell her you're going to let her outside today and remind her you need to know where she is if she wants to go next door. Ultimately, you want to encourage her to understand safety rules.  A child who knows why she needs to stay close to you or let you know when she is going next door will keep doing that as she gets older - and will not have the arguments as a teenager about telling you when she's at a friend's house, either.  Empowering her by giving her the tools she needs to understand why she should do what she does will pay off both now and in the future."
What do we do when timeouts are not effective?,"I don't know what you do, specifically for his timeouts (does he sit in a chair in the corner? Does he stand, facing the corner? Does he just sit on the couch or a chair somewhere?), but what I found works for my son is sit him on a stool in the middle of the room and ignore him for a few minutes. The stool is too high for him to try to get down, and he still has to watch everyone do things without him. Another option could be sending him to his room for a while. This of course, only works if he has no form of entertainment in his room, but the complete isolation could be unpleasant enough for him to think twice about misbehaving. What I also often do when my son is misbehaving (especially when doing something like hitting or something else to another person) is to sit him down on the floor (usually when my son does it, he's on the couch) with a firm ""no."" It startles him enough that he gets the picture. Doug makes another good suggestion - taking something away. If simply taking something away doesn't work, it may also work to put it somewhere that he can see it, but can't reach it, which eliminates the ""out of sight, out of mind,"" case.  The key is to find something that he finds unpleasant and make him learn that that unpleasant thing will keep happening if he behaves in a way you don't approve. It may require getting creative, so take a look at the things he likes to do or use and take that away from him. It may take some observation time, but will be something that only you can come up with."
Is it appropriate to force an almost-5yo child to do things (at school) when they don't want to cooperate?,"Your question is asking for an opinion, so it will draw a variety of opinions. The one most helpful will be that which resonates best with your personal philosophy. With that in mind, I'll offer mine. I believe that when a child is sent off to school, it's a big leap into society, and ""society"" (by definition the aggregate of people living together in a more or less ordered community) has rules/a code to live by. The teachers usually have everyone's best interests in mind, not just their own, and what works best for the entire class is what they codify. I think going to the bathroom on schedule and engaging in activities when the teachers want the kids to do so is good for the child, as at some time or another, kids need to learn that they don't always get to do only what they want to do. On the other hand, blind obedience isn't my idea of a healthy adaptation, either. Needing to guide how a child colors is (imo) inappropriate on the part of the teacher, and I wouldn't hesitate to ask that this be dropped. Gently seating her on the toilet is fine, but being upset with her if she doesn't then urinate is not. Having a discussion with the head teacher about cutting her some slack when possible is fine (put more diplomatically, of course.) So is discussing the difference between acceptable vs. unacceptable behavior at school with your daughter. Being in society involves some give and take. You say, ...at home, strong boundaries and natural consequences have done wonders. We don't shout or hit, and she is happy and cooperative most of the time. Should it be different at school? If she has rules to follow at home, it should be no different at school. They may be different rules than home rules, but that should not be confusing to her at her age."
Is a Rubik's cube an appropriate gift for a 15-month-old child?,"At 15 months old, a rubik's cube would not be appropriate. First, it's kind of a complex puzzle.  Most adults can't solve it.  A 15 month old is going to see it as a brightly colored cube and nothing more.  She will get entertainment value out of it by probably trying throw it or eat it (the stickers aren't good to eat and the individual block pieces are choking hazards).  She won't even understand the goal of a rubik's cube, much less be interested in accomplishing it. Second, most rubik's cubes I've seen are small enough the fit comfortably in an adult's hand.  Being so small, she won't have the muscle control to really handle it properly.  She won't be able to precisely turn the sides of the cube, much less line it up to be able to turn another side. Kids at that age generally need bigger toys that require less fine motor skills.  Go google toddler toys.  That should give you a better idea what to look for."
