How to deal with people who randomly go all-in?,"This is very much related to this question:
How big an edge can you have on a tournament field ? ROI vs edge question You have to balance the chance that your hand will win against a random hand with the actual advantage you gain from getting their stack. In general, I'd advise folding with less than a premium pocket pair preflop, and continuing on the flop with TPGK or better."
"In a private live game, how do you deal with severe violations of table etiquette?","When faced with these situations in my home games, we begin to institute a penalty of some sort for any recurring violations. I think that works for both serious and friendly games - it may simply alter what penalty you choose. Examples we have followed:"
Simplest Way to Explain EV to Beginners,"Say we have a $1 million raffle that has only two tickets: a winner and a loser. I give you a random ticket and tell you that you MUST sell it. How much money should you sell it for? (I.e. how much is it worth?) A. $1 million?
No, because it could just as easily be worth $0. B. $0?
No, because it could just as easily be worth $1 million. C. $0.5 million?
Yes. This is the expected value of the ticket.  Notice that the holder of the winning ticket will never actually get $0.5 million. They will either get $0 or $1 million. We just use $0.5M as the expected value. If you sell it for more than $0.5M, you made money on the deal. If you sell it for less than $0.5M, you lost money on the deal. Note: We got $0.5 million by multiplying the odds of winning (0.5) by the amount of money you would win ($1 million). You would use the same strategy in poker, where the ""value of the winning raffle ticket"" is the money in the pot, and the ""odds of winning the raffle"" are the odds of your poker hand winning. Another way to think about this is from the point of view of the raffle creator.  Say I am giving away $1 million in my raffle again with two tickets. How much should I sell each ticket in order to break even? Well, if I am giving away $1 million, I want to make sure that I am getting $1 million back, otherwise I will be losing money (if I sell it for less), or making money (if I sell it for more). A. $1 million per ticket?
No, because then I will take in $2 million total (2 tickets * $1 million each).
I would make money in this case. B. $0 per ticket?
No, because then I will take in $0 total (2 tickets * $0 each).
I would lose money in this case. C. $0.5 million per ticket?
Yes, because now I will break even by getting back $1 million (2 tickets * $0.5 each)."
"How do you recognize when you are playing ""on tilt""?",I can think of two tell-tale signs:
Is there a comprehensive source for poker terminology?,"One good place to start is the tags page on this site.  Any tag used on a post will show up there, and they should all have definitions.  If you see one that isn't defined, please add a definition to it. Some terms that may not show up as tags: Robert's Rules of Poker also contains lots of common definitions, and is available as a web page, downloadable web page, or Word document."
What is a 'wet board'?,"The term wet refers to the connectedness of the community cards. It's translatable to most all variants of poker depending on the game mechanics.  Specifically, there are three things to consider when judging the wetness of a board, There are nuances regarding wetness. Wetness is relative to the opponents range. This is important when considering how to proceed against specific opponents, as the same board isn't wet for all types of opponents. For example, vs a tight opponent, a board consisting of high, suited, connected cards is wet, but not necessarily so for an opponent who is very loose. This is after consideration of the width of an opponents likely range. "
Is it impolite to leave a cash game when I'm about to be the big blind?,"No, it is absolutely not rude to leave from UTG. Frankly, it a crazy suggestion. What right does anyone have other than yourself to compel you to spend your own money against your will! From any position, it's still your money. I'd suggest they were the rude one for proposing it. Not only is it fine, it's strategically best as it minimizes the cost per hand relative to the blinds, by seeing the whole round."
What can I do  to calculate my odds in a hand?,"The simple case, for making your hand on the next turn, is to add up the number of cards that can give you the winning hand on the next turn, and divide by the total number of unseen cards left in the deck.  This means that, in games like Stud, you need to remove any potential outs that have been folded by others from the cards that can give you a winning hand. In general, if you have seen 5 cards, and you have 4 to a flush, there are 47 unseen cards, and 9 that will give you a flush.  If you think a flush is the winning hand, you have a 19.14% chance.  If you are playing a flop game and you are up against a set, you have to discount the one flush card that would pair the board, which means you have 8 outs out of 47, or 17%. So, for the ""next card"" solution, you have: When there are multiple cards left, more advanced statistics become involved.  You have to consider cards that may give your opponents the best hand, as well as conditional probabilities.  In flop games with only the turn and river to go, and shared board cards, an approximation of the formula would be: In that case, opponent outs are outs that will give your opponent a better hand than you.  Depending on the hand you are drawing to, and your opponent's hand, the formula can be simpler - in the case of a flush draw against a set, you have 8 outs twice, but your opponent will have 6 cards on the turn that give him a full house, and 9 cards on the river that will do the same."
"What are Pot Odds, and how do I determine them?","What are Pot Odds? Pot odds are the value of the pot (how much you stand to win) in comparison to the cost of you calling, and are most often used to evaluate the value of making the considered call.  Calculating Pot Odds Pot odds are a ratio, Pot Value : Call Cost To convert this ratio to an equivalent percentage, divide the Call Cost by the sum of the Pot Value and Call Cost: To convert a percentage back to a ratio, subtract the Pot Odds Percentage from 100, and divide the remaining number by the Pot Odds Percentage: Using Pot Odds to Calculate Value of a Call Example: If the pot is $50, and the cost to call is $10 your pot odds are 50:10 or 5:1 (16.7%) when reduced. If the odds of you drawing the winning hand are greater than 5:1 (16.7%), there is positive value in calling the bet. If the odds are less than the pot odds ratio/percentage, there is a negative value. Miscellaneous  Obviously, even if the expected value of calling is positive you may still lose the hand... but over extended sessions these value calculations will be true statistically. The trick often happens when using pot odds early in a hand (ex. Flop or Turn in Texas Hold'em) where the pot odds and chance of winning the pot may change again... this brings up the concept of implied odds and can be read about on Wikipedia and all over."
How are side pots built?,"Side pots develop from the fact that players can only win a maximum of the amount that they wagered from each of the players who call them. Thus any wagers above that amount are placed in a separate pot which is competed for by everyone except for the all-in player. As to your specific questions: The only way for x players to be all-in is for there to be x+1 players in the hand, or for at least two of them to have exactly the same amount of chips. Thus there will be a maximum of x-1 side pots (if all players each have a different amount of chips), in addition to the main pot. If any players have the same amount of chips, then there will be one less side pot for each time this occurs.  "
Minimum re-raise in Hold em,"In limit games, the only raise amount allowed is the big blind during preflop and flop play; double the big blind during turn and river play. The correct minimum raise in big bet games (no limit and pot limit) is to increase the amount of the bet by the amount of the previous bet (e.g. double the previous raise*), or to raise all-in if you do not have enough in your stack to actually double the previous raise. Reference: http://www.learn-texas-holdem.com/how-large-is-the-minimum-raise.htm Note that doubling the previous raise is different than doubling the previous bet. If I were to bet 100 and you raised to 300, someone could raise to 500, even though it would take 600 to double your bet. In the case of an all-in, there is a distinction between what it allowed for the raising player, and what constitutes a raise to the rest of the players at the table. If a bet is considered to be a full raise, it reopens the betting, allowing another player to raise again if they choose. In the case of an all-in for less than the minimum raise, the all-in is allowed, but it does not constitute a full raise, and as such it does not reopen betting. In many cases, betting will reopen for an all-in raise that is a fraction of a full raise as well, though this varies a bit from casino to casino. Typically, if this is the case, the most common amount required to reopen betting is 1/2 of a full raise. As noted in the comments on the question, one place where the definition of what constitutes a minimum raise is in the situation where a three-way pot occurs with the smallest stack acting third and shoving all-in for less than a true raise. That is: Player A raises to 300, then B raises to 500, then C shoves for 599. If A calls, then in most casinos the only options B has left are to call or fold; since no one made a full raise after his last raise, he is not permitted to raise again. Had C shoved for 600 or more, many casinos (but not all) casinos would allow B to raise again."
The state of the art of the pokerbots of poker academy," It's totaly about artificial intelligence issue. They read the poker table window as an image, and each part of the table with information specific to the hand is analyzed and recorded for computation. No matter how they were written well, no matter how they created in a good intteligence, no bots can be successful as such as a person. Because poker is not only a card game.  What is the truth about them ? The truth about them, they play in in poker rooms more than you think. But today's technology prevents a lot of them. ""I believe that poker sites should allow bots, but only on clearly defined tables. Players should know who the bots are, and have the choice if they would like to play them or not,"" says Barry Greenstein. How good are they in playing poker ? Giving an answer to this question is subjective but they are playing good. In the summer 2005, the online poker room Golden Palace hosted a promotional tournament in Las Vegas, at the old Binions, with a $100k giveaway prize. It was billed as the 2005 World Series of Poker Robots. The tournament was bots only with no entry fee. The bot developers were computer scientists from six nationalities who traveled at their own expense. The host platform was Poker Academy. The event also featured a demonstration headsup event with Phil Laak."
How good are the best poker bots?,"From what I've heard and read, one of the most advanced poker bots is PokerSnowie, an artificial intelligence built using a neural network. That's only being used in training software though. As for online poker bots actually playing, and avoiding detection, on PokerStars for instance... I'm not sure. Any poker bot not based on a neural network is liking just playing a static maximally exploitative strategy vs. population tendencies, with pre-programmed adjustments for certain player types and frequencies. They likely can grind out a profit, albeit not a large one. Certain Vegas casinos are also offering limit Hold'em machines where you can play against AI. These are built using neural networks as well. I can't find the article but a poker player/programmer spent years developing a limit Hold'em neural network that he fed millions of hands into, effectively teaching it the population tendencies. He then won contracts with some of the Vegas casinos for LHE machines. I don't think online poker bots are a huge problem yet. It's fairly easy to detect them and PokerStars is quite diligent in that regard. They will throw up captcha's if their system flags someone as potentially being a bot. I myself have had to do a captcha while multi-tabling a large amount of tables. And of course it's considered cheating. Once a computer program is taking actions for you, most poker sites consider it cheating. They'll allow software that helps you make better decisions, but anything that acts for you generally isn't allowed."
How do you hide your tells?,"Even though seeking to completely control one's tells is a good goal to aim for, it may be a good idea not to give them a chance of happening. One way of accomplishing this, noted in Phil Gordon's Little Green Book, is not to look at your cards until it is your turn to act (before the Flop in Texas Hold'em).
Or, to state it in a more general way:
The less we know, the less we can give away.  Of course, knowing less is often a disadvantage, so we'll have to weigh up carefully how much information we'll keep from ourselves in order to keep it from attentive opponents. However: Not looking at our hole cards before we have to means less time for our opponents to get a read on us, while we would probably not profit from knowing our cards at this stage. Furthermore, it prevents us from losing interest in a hand prematurely when we could be observing our opponents carefully, trying to put them on a possibly range of hands.  Another solid strategy (also taken from the Little Green Book) is not to vary the size of your bets according to the strength of your hand. This seems weird at first, but when combined with a tight-aggressive approach, this can go a long way in concealing your hand from your opponent. After all, the real reason we are trying to avoid tells is that we don't want our opponent to know, or have a good guess about, the actual cards we are holding - betting medium hands weakly and strong hands strongly while checking/calling when we have a draw will give our opponents a good idea about what cards we are holding.   Corollary: play less hands (tight), and do not vary your bet with the strength of your hand (i.e. bet the same amount with JJ, AK and maybe even occasionally T9 suited before the flop). However, once in every few hands, reverse your betting pattern by slowplaying a big or medium-strength hand, confusing those who are trying to analyze your play.  Every time we bet or raise, we are forcing our opponents to make decisions. The way they react to this forcing serves as an indicator of the strength of their hand and their willingness to play it - we are forcing them to give us information about their hand, while simultaneously representing a strong hand (whether we have one or not).  This answer contains just several small aspects of the big picture - a true answer to your question could fill books (and books have been filled with just that topic). However, I hope the above thoughts provide a starting point."
Is online poker legal or not in the United States ?,"Please, before you continue reading and make any decisions based on what I'm about to tell you, you must understand two important things: I'm not a lawyer.  I can't even say that I dabble in law.  I'm not an expert on these matters, and many people who are expert disagree with one another.  As simple as your question may seem, it is not easy to answer. Everything I'm about to say applies to the United States only. I've heard that online poker is not legal, and also that it is. Which is it? Unfortunately, it seems to be both in the United States. Bottom line: There is no Federal law that makes playing poker online illegal. There is, however, a Federal law (UIGEA) that makes some financial transactions to and from an online poker site illegal -- this law applies to the site itself, not the players.  If there are any laws against playing online poker (as is the case in some states) and you add money to an online poker site, or withdraw money from an online poker site and use a US bank to do it, the poker site has broken this federal law by facilitating this transaction. To get around this problem, these foreign poker sites use 3rd party processors and non-US banks to issue checks. Also, since 2015, all of the major sites have begun accepting crypto-currencies as these appear to be treated differently than USD in a legal sense, as well as offer a way to bypass the US banking system. Each state in the union has different laws regarding the legal status of gambling activities.  So, even though it might not be against Federal law to play online poker, it might be illegal in a particular state.  Do some research. The Federal Wire Act of 1961 is often cited as a law that makes online poker illegal. However, this too applied to the sites and not the players. Moreover, the DoJ in 2011 released a formal legal opinion that the Wire Act applies only to sports betting. The US Circuit Court of Appeals issues a similar ruling. EDIT - UPDATED 2017: I think still more needs to be said here.  Although there is no Federal law that says ""playing poker on the Internet for real money is a Federal crime,"" the legal environment is still a gray area. Many jurisdictions within the USA have no laws against online poker, but no laws supporting or regulating it either. The DoJ shut down 3 major online poker sites (PokerStars, FullTilt Poker & Cereus) and seized all the money held by the players there. After some time, one of those sites, PokerStars, was able to settle with the US DoJ for $700 million. This was a combination deal where in PokerStars paid off all of their own players as well as the players from Full Tilt Poker which it was found to have been using player funds for operational purposes and was thus insolvent. The funds were returned to players via the Full Tilt Poker Claims website. Not all players claimed funds however, and the remainder of funds were used to settle player debts from Cereus Network (Absolute Poker and Ultimate Bet), which were also found to be operating on player funds/insolvent.  Full Tilt was eventually purchased and integrated into PokerStars and Cereus Network went out of business completely. PokerStars has since re-entered the USA, via the regulated market of New Jersey, where it operates PokerStarsNJ, along side other regulated operators like Borgata, Party Poker, and 888 - see full list of regulated NJ sites at the NJ Division of Gaming Enforcement. Even after their success in getting a toehold in New Jersey however, PS has yet to succeed in their attempt to get a Nevada gaming license due to ""bad actor"" clauses and active intervention by other gambling trade groups.   In 2012, the Department of Homeland Security shut down another poker network (Everleaf Gaming). Yet very few people, even executives of purported illegal gambling operations have ever faced much legal backlash. For example, Calvin Ayre, the founder of the Bodog gambling brands was once wanted on the FBI's top 10 list. Yet after over 5 years hiding out in Antigua, all of his felony counts were dropped, he pleaded guilty to a single misdemeanor, and was only fined $300,000 USD. This was the founder of a billion dollar business and just goes to show that there is not much political will to stick it to gambling companies, much less individual players. Any American who chooses to play poker online for money is taking a risk with that money. However given the recent legal changes, i.e. the DoJ changing stances on the Wire Act of 1961, Federal judges ruling that poker is not gambling but a game of skill, Kentucky State losing a court case of seized domain names of many gaming sites, Black Friday players being reimbursed and sanctioned by the US DoJ and a slew of other pro-poker decisions, most people firmly believe that the risk is greatly reduced circa 2017. It is worth noting that the States of Delaware, New Jersey, and Nevada, all of which have regulated online poker and various forms of online gambling, have seen no intervention whatsoever from the US Federal Government. Some would say that you might conclude from this that the Federal government is of the opinion that playing online poker for real money is itself an issue of State's Rights. Even though there is nothing black-and-white that says that actually playing is illegal, the Federal government has appeared in recent years to be breaking down the hurdles for state sanctioned Internet gambling making it possible for Americans to play poker online for real money if their state agrees to regulate it and/or if they are willing to take their chances at offshore online poker sites."
A TAG LAG paradox?,"The books your are reading are telling you to play this way as it will help you to exploit these kind of players and its correct. Its not telling you how they need to react to counter your play style. If you are playing against a tight player you can definately open up your range a lot more and make aggressive plays. If they miss the flop then they are likely to fold and you win the hand uncontested. If you are playing a looser player then you should try and only call with your premium hands and when you get them play them aggressively. If you call with AA and there is an Ace on the flop, chances are that a loose player is going to try and represent that Ace not knowing that you have got him dominated. So you are going to get a lot more value out of them. In this situation you can just call there raises as they are likely to keep c-betting. Then on the river shove (assuming you havent let any draws in) and you are likely to get paid off. If they are an intelligent player and think you have a tight image, any sign of aggression should make them realise that you have a monster. The majority of the time though this isnt the case and you can take their stacks easily by sticking to your game. So in conclusion you want them to play loose against you when you are playing tight because that is how you will get the most value out of them. If they are tight and showing aggression then you know that you should let the hand go and wait for a better spot. Hope this helps in some way."
When should I use a polarized vs. a merged range?,"There is no time when an exclusively low value range is optimal.  The purpose of including low value hands in a range is to extract additional value from high value hands, or to play more hands in general against opponents that fold too often.  In the first case, you need high value hands in your range to make the strategy work.  In the second, there is no reason to limit yourself to low value hands. Against loose-passive opponents, who will play most hands and take them to the river, you will want to play high-value hands.  Since these players can't be bluffed, you need hands that can get to showdown and win.  Your ""high value"" range can expand to include some medium hands depending on how light opponents will call down (if they call down with any pair, hands that make second pair can be played profitably), but it will not include low value hands. This is the best strategy against a level 0 player. As your opponents become more able to fold hands in certain situations, it becomes profitable to start adding bluffs to your range.  When adding bluffs to a range, it is best to start with hands that have little-to-no showdown value - the 72o-type hands.  There are a few spots this can be applied.  A polarized range can be used when 3-betting in position pre-flop against a good opponent.  A good opponent will not call with many hands out of position - they may have some high value hands in their calling range, but for the most part they will 4-bet or fold.  In this situation, you will either want to get your money all-in, or fold.  You go all-in with your high value hands, and fold the rest.  So if you 3-bet with a hand like AJs, but have to fold to an all-in, that is a waste of a hand that can be profitably played in position.  This is why we polarize our range - when we get 4-bet with 72o, and have to fold, we aren't losing value. A similar place where a polarized range can be useful is a flop check-raising situation.  When the board comes out K 8 4 rainbow, and you check-raise, you are representing a very strong range - mainly sets, possibly AK.  To balance that range, you can add hands like small pocket pairs or missed suited connectors - these hands have little-to-no value against the range that your opponent will continue with. This will be the best strategy against a level 1 or level 2 player. A merged range comes into play when your opponent starts adjusting to your polarized range.  On the previous flop of K 8 4, an opponent may start adjusting to your polarized raising range by calling down with second pair, or a pocket pair like 99 or 77.  Suddenly, we can start raising hands like KJ and QQ for value.  A merged range will put opponents to many more difficult decisions, which will likely lead to them making more mistakes. This strategy will be best employed against higher level thinkers, where there are significant meta-game factors and constant adjustment of ranges as the match proceeds."
"What is the""Top Five Cards"" rule and how does it apply to splitting pots?","If you are playing a 5 card game (like Hold-Em) then only the top 5 cards play. So, in this case, there are 4 on the table (6-9) and you each have a 10, for the best possible hand a 6-10 straight.  It is also possible that you have AA, and friend KK, but the board comes out 3-4-5-6-7 and you split as you both play the best hand - the board."
How to detect tells online?,"In online poker the only tells you can get are: You should treat bet sizing as a FACTOR of the hand, and consider it and keep it in mind in EVERY hand, not handle it like a tell. Tells can help you win the hand, make better decisions, and are necessary to notice. Sometimes they can get you huge advantages, but USUALLY you can make optimal decisions without them. So, when someone make quick calls, usually it's a tell (it's not a tell though, if someone always makes quick bets); on draw heavy boards, a quick call is a draw most of the time. When someone waits an extremely long time before they raise, usually they have a big, nut-type hand. When someone makes a bet and starts talking, they are trying to make you either call or fold, but it's a general good rule that players who are bluffing try to avoid paying the other players attention, so it (might be) more likely that he wants you to call. (Again, if he talks a lot anyway, this could have no meaning at all.) It can be a tell also if someone never makes quick bets and now he made one; this could mean he already planned the hand, before the card came, or he had such a hand he doesn't need to think at all (maybe the best or worst hands can be these types of hands in situations). These are the types of tells you look for in online poker. But be aware! A quick change in the players behavior doesn't always mean something, if you don't know what the opposite thing means with this player. And it's obvious but when someone says ""I have to pee"" obviously it has nothing to do with the hand (except that you can steal his big blind on the other table :D) Oh and I almost forgot, you shouldn't always rely on timing tells because connection issues can cause them too..."
What is a proper starting bankroll?,"Now then... SoboLAN's answer was a great one for MTTs. For SNGs, you can probably start out a bit lower than that - around 60% of his recommendation should be ok if you are playing a relatively low number of games simultaneously and/or you are playing regular-speed games. If you are multi-tabling turbo SNGs, you should probably stick with the values he gave. For cash games, Toby's answer listed a lot of the factors that you should consider. I'll add to that with some specific recommendations. If you're willing to deposit more money into your BR should you encounter a bad run AND/OR you are willing to move down in stakes, then you should be ok to use 25 buy-in base. As you move up in stakes, your edge on the field shrinks while the money becomes harder to replace and more meaningful. That should, generally, cause you to require a larger bankroll. In mid-stakes, a 40 buy-in minimum is pretty reasonable. Some prefer more.  Then as you move into high-stakes, you should increase further. I have pretty limited experience with any stakes that would be called ""high"" (e.g. over $1k buy-in cash games), but when I was flirting with those games, I wanted at least 50 buy-ins. *As another posted noted in the comments on the question, the one exception to my statement that 200 times the big blind is never enough is if you are playing fixed-limit games. In limit, it is proper to use a multiple of the blind to determine your BR requirements, however big bets are a more common measure than big blinds. Typically a big bet (e.g. the bet size on the turn and river of limit games) is double the big blind and 200x the big bet is probably fine for starting out. As you progress to higher stakes, you'll want to move to 300x the big bet or more."
Positions in Poker,"When it comes to seat positions in poker, you have to keep in mind that it varies depending on how many players there are at the table. So, here they are: (There are some variations on this, from place to place. This is normal since these positions are not actually formally and officially defined; they're just based on intuition and informal agreement. For example, sometimes you'll find that, in the case of 5 players, there is no Cut-Off, but UTG+1 instead.) So the early/middle/late positions depend on how many players you have. Also, when it comes to the blinds, it depends on the context: if we're talking about pre-flop, then the blinds are part of the late positions; otherwise they belong to the early positions. You will find in most places that the blinds are part of the early positions. There are 2 reasons for this: All this matters from a theoretical point of view. When it comes to strategies and decisions, position is obviously a crucial factor. But the name of these positions don't matter at all at this point. All that matters is: You can see this tendency in advanced poker strategy: the complexity rises and the precision goes down. Everything becomes more nuanced instead of exact numbers. This includes all the odds. Suddenly, the difference between a 2.5 pot odds and 2.9 pot odds is completely irrelevant. You don't hear about UTG+1 and Hijack anymore; instead you hear about ""early position / late position"" or maybe ""in position / out of position"". The actual mechanics, hand ranges, mental processes and body languages behind the strategy are what's important, not the cold precise mathematics."
Should I call this river overbet with an overpair?,"I think the only realistic options for villain are a missed draw or Tx.  I think he'd have gotten more aggressive earlier if he had you preflop.  Your line looks a lot like an overpair to me, and as such, he would want to get value out of you if he had trips or a full house.  As such, I don't think he shoves the river here if he wanted a call.  He knows you are not thrilled about the river and is trying to get you to fold."
What's the optimum time to enter a tournament with late registration?,"You should enter the tournament as early as possible. Presumably, you're participating in the tournament because you have some sort of edge against the field. In other words, you should be playing the tournament because it is profitable for you to do so. Playing the earlier stages of the tournament lets you play more hands against your opponents, which (particularly in the long run) reduces variance (see the law of large numbers). Playing the earlier stages of the tournament also lets you play against the weakest players who are likely to make massive mistakes early on that get them eliminated quickly. Being able to capitalize on these mistakes and get a large stack early is a huge opportunity that you shouldn't pass up. Finally, the earlier stages of the tournament have deeper stacks. Instead of getting into lots of marginal spots where you're coin-flipping preflop you'll have more room to navigate postflop. Your skill over your opponents is more easily realized with deeper stacks."
Publicly available poker stats,"Not sure if it covers the games you're looking for but it's a useful resource to mention anyway. University of Alberta Computer Poker Research Group Database has something like 10 Million hands for free to download. Check it out. As a side note, their papers about Poker AI and decision making are always very insightful."
Classic Books for Texas Hold'Em,"The big four are definitely: I'd throw the Harrington on Hold'em books in there as well for No Limit Hold'em tournaments, but Al G already mentioned them, so there's no need for repetition."
Is Small Ball Poker In Cash Games A Good Strategy?,"Your second question is unanswerable. Estimating what the mix of styles in a tournament will be on average is too inflexible an assumption for any strategic use. Your first question is more interesting and problematic. Can we play small-ball poker in a cash-game? Yes, but it takes far greater personal involvement from the player, and frankly doesn't lead to vastly improved results. It's more useful against smarter opponents, but the poker community represents a bell curve of skill. Unless you're playing the top few percent, it's rarely going to matter. Seriously. Read on if you're interested in my reasoning. The short version Considering most game dynamics in cash games, I advocate playing slightly larger than small-ball, and don't overdo the aggression. That may sound arbitrary, but you'll soon know what I mean when your opponents won't let you play a small pot with any high frequency, and are constantly testing your weak bets and small raises with re-raises and all-ins when you inevitably have weak hands.  Big pots impact your win rate differently in cash, and small-ball will make it an incredibly difficult path to tread, where one mistake will be close to unrecoverable. If your opponent is too aggressive, it's not so bad to small-ball. Try to play a wider range, but stick to being aggressive when you have a value-hand. The long version Almost all things in poker come down to frequencies. Either you're doing something too much, or not enough. e.g. you fold too much, you call too little, etc. It's easy to call it balance. Small-ball, and conversely, big-ball strategies are about these frequencies. Small ball advocates you play a wider range, and play it more, perhaps very aggressively. Big-Ball poker advocates the opposite, tighter although not overly passive. In the linked article we see this... ""Small-ball poker benefits from players who call you down with
  mediocre hands because they do not give you credit for holding a
  strong hand."" We can flip that statement to this... ""Big-ball poker benefits from players who fold to you with mediocre
  hands because they do give you credit for holding a strong hand."" Both of these statements concern your image, and using it deceptively. That's not a narrow subject. Without maths, that's about all of poker! Finding the balance between them is good poker. Small-ball in my mind has its place, correctly, in tournament poker. The majority of anyones time in a tournament is short-stacked (less than 50bb). That's about all . How often do you have 100bb or more at a tournament table? How often does more than one player have that? At your table? The answer is rarely. There is a perpetual mindset of survival in tournament poker, which isn't there with cash games. Although it's useful to know who's scared of losing and who isn't at any table type, the result is definitive in a tournament. When you bust, that's it, game over. Extracting bluffs in this environment is more difficult than average. This pot-to-stack ratio issue, and this survival mindset, lead to inevitably poor implied odds in a tournament for each hand. Which is why playing a high frequency, high aggressive style will reap greater dividends in this case. The idea that you steal small pots very often, balances the negative effects of increasing blinds and dwindling stack sizes. If you get in a pot for stacks, it's unusual without two big hands showing up. Small-ball wins the day. If a tournament is about survival, then a cash game is about opulence. In cash, big pots are king. Implied odds are far more important.The small pots are just for positioning your image. Small pots are crucial, but they are not the desired outcome like in tournaments. Try this out. If you track your stats, filter for your own hands where you won/lost <5BB; 5-15BB; 15-40BB; 40-65BB; >65BB. Look at where you're earning your profit from. Invariably, big pots are where most profit comes from. What you're likely to see is that big pot profitability bears a striking resemblance to your overall profitability. Gear your game to focus on deceiving your opponents into big-pot mistakes and you'll improve your win-rate. You might say that ""By winning small pots, I'm setting them up for a big one later, right?"". True, but the frequencies you represent by playing small-ball will mean you have to adjust your understanding of what is a big hand for you now. Your value hands later will have thinner equity than what is usually considered value for a TAG, e.g sets, straights, flushes, etc. You'll have to be ready take down medium and large pots with top pair-mid kicker type hands, regularly, to cover your losses and avoid being exploited by the inevitable increase in bluffs you are faced with. From my experience, there are better ways to crush poker than using a small ball strategy in a cash game."
"What does ""run it twice"" mean?","When: The two players may: Mechanics: The cards that have been dealt so far will be part of all the outcomes Deal out the rest of the hand (including burnt cards) as usual and
decide the result   Move the cards that were dealt out in step 2 out of the way Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you have run the hand the desired number of times (n) Result: Motivation: Player may do this to try to reduce the variance impact of very large pots on their win rate.  For some players and some games, the outcomes of very large pots can dominate your win rate Because very large pots are comparatively rare you might have to play for a long time before your actual win rate from these pots approaches you expected win rate. Running it twice is like doubling the number of times the situation occurs. As the number of trials increases the likely-hood of your actual win rate being close to your expected win rate increases. In very large pots, very rare events, like a player hitting a 1 outer can have a large effect on your overall win rate. Running the hand multiple times reduces the statistical impact of these rare events on your win rate, especially in the short term. If a player doesn't have multiple buy-ins, running the hand multiple times reduces the odds of them being knocked out of the game completely by any single hand."
When Is It A Good Tactic To Slowplay A Hand?,"Ask yourself what Btn is likely to have for his pre-flop raise and continuation bet, and if you just call what are the chances he will bet again on the turn. Check raising here just screams that you have hit your hand (set or two pair) so you're unlikely to get further action. If you want to check raise, much better to at least give him another chance to bet on the turn. What are the chances that he's :- a) already way ahead and you're drawing to one card (10 10 or 8 8) b) behind but with some chance of outdrawing you (J 9 or 9 7 - is he aggressive enough to raise pre-flop from the button with this?) Even if he does make his straight on the turn, you still have 10 outs on the river to make a full house.  c) well behind and unlikely to outdraw you, but likely to bet again if he hits his draw (e.g. A 10) - this is your ideal scenario and most likely to produce a big pot. d) got two pairs (e.g. 10 8) - can you avoid going broke in the unlikely event of the board pairing the right way (for him) on the turn / river.  e) got an over pair, again unlikely to outdraw you, but hard to spot when he does. What's your reaction going to be if an over card comes on the turn and he bets again? f) two over cards (e.g. A K) - how much further action do you expect even if he hits his hand on the turn / river? g) runner runner flush draw. How will you react if the turn matches one of the existing suits and he bets again. g) any other hand - what range of hands will he raise from the button and continuation bet (any two cards?) Is he likely to keep bluffing with nothing? I would say that on this particular flop, you're unlikely to be losing (unless you're already a mile behind), so much better to give Btn another chance to hang himself rather than scaring him off."
What is a straddle bet?,"A straddle refers to an extra blind bet made preflop. Typically, this is made by the first player after the big blind (e.g. the Under-the-gun player), however in some variants that is not the case (some allow the button to straddle; others allow straddles from any position on the table). In the end, it depends on the rules of the casino. In almost all situations, the player who makes the straddle is given the right to act last preflop. Postflop order of play is unaffected (and proceeds the same as it would if there were no straddle). For more information on the types of straddles and when they might be useful, see http://www.parttimepoker.com/understanding-the-straddle-in-texas-holdem-poker-facts-thoughts-and-strategies"
How to best teach poker to a novice in 1 month?,"I would suggest you play some online freerolls to get the feel for online poker. If you can deposit (not sure based on the US rules) then I would deposit as much as you are comfortable losing. Dont deposit $200 if you can only really afford $75 for example. Then you need to stick to some strict Bankroll Management. With regards to books, there are hundreds of books out there that you could learn from. The ones that always crop up are the Harrington on Holdem. There are 3 of them and they are a bit dated, but they will give you a good solid foundation to build upon. I would also suggest you watch youtube strategy videos and any live poker you can to pick up tips. Then you just need to put in some volume and learn as you go along. One thing to note is that online play and live play are totally different, you may be really good at live poker but not to good at online, or vice versa. Only you can decide when you are ready in my opinion. I could write all day giving you things to research to help you improve but you would be better off just reading poker forums such as Two Plus Two and Pocket Fives and of course browsing through this site. Software There is a lot of tracking software out there. The two most popular are  I have only used HEM2 so cannot comment on PokerTracker. HEM2 will track all cash and tournaments on certain sites, you will have to check if its compatible with any site you decide to play on. It will also give you a HUD on each table that shows you each players stats which helps you to make decisions based on what kind of player they are. HEM2 also has several addons available such as: The top two can be used to help you analyse your own hands and see where you are leaking chips and help you to learn places where you should be getting your chips in to try and pick up good sized pots. Again i could write a lot more about software, but its probably best that you look into each one yourself. They are not free, but you can quite often get special deals through sites like the ones i mentioned above. Tracking other players There are a couple of good websites that will allow you to track other players to see if they are profitable players or losing players. I recommend the following: They dont cover all sites, but the main ones are covered. Hope this helps.

What's the best book to read to understand this site?,"I assume you are interested in texas holdem(Most common type of poker card game) Your selection of learning materials depends on type of game you play(Fixed/No limi cash, Heads up, SNG, MTT) I found nice list of best books.

Who wins if a player mis-identifies their hand?,"Casinos in the US generally have the ""cards speak"" rule. That is, when a hand is properly tabled--exposed to everyone at showdown--it is the responsibility of all players, the dealer, floormen, and anyone else present to see that the pot is awarded to the best hand shown, regardless of what the players might say. Some players object to this rule: they believe that if a player or railbird says ""Wait, Bob has a flush"", that's unfairly helping a player. But the rule is clear: once the hand is tabled, others have not only the right but the obligation to help ensure the pot is awarded correctly. There are a couple of caveats: if a player only shows his hand to another player, or to the dealer, or to any other person, without properly tabling it for everyone, that player has no rights yet and those to whom the hand was shown should remain silent to protect other players' properly shown hands. But once the hand is tabled, it's fair game and everyone can and should assist in reading the hands. Finally, in some cases, if a floorman feels that a player has deliberately overcalled his hand to induce a player with a better hand to fold, he may penalize that player by awarding the pot to someone else, even possibly to a folded hand. Some California lowball clubs even had a rule that a player who remained silent rather than explicitly calling out a pair could be ruled against in this way."
How do you determine which player needs to show their cards first?,"This rule will vary from house to house.  The two options are: In any case, after the first person shows, the onus to show (or muck) proceeds clockwise around the table. The most common rulebook used is Robert's Rules of Poker.  Chapter 3, THE SHOWDOWN Section, rule 8 lists: If everyone checks (or is all-in) on the final betting round, the
  player who acted first is the first to show the hand. If there is
  wagering on the final betting round, the last player to take
  aggressive action by a bet or raise is the first to show the hand. In
  order to speed up the game, a player holding a probable winner is
  encouraged to show the hand without delay. If there are one or more
  side pots ( because someone is all-in ), players are asked to aid in
  determining the pot winner by not showing their cards until a pot they
  are in is being settled. Which is equivalent to option 2 above."
Maximizing profit post-bubble,"great question!!! when reaching near the bubble there are three types of players (=stack sizes):
1. those who struggle to just get into the money (and have small stacks).
2. those who have enough money to get in the money and do nothing unless they have really good hands (don't leave their comfort zone). and ..
3. those who have big stacks or medium stack and willing to take some risks. let me guess... you usually belong to the first two groups. I even take a risk and guess that in most of the game your stack is high above average. The dynamic of the game is changing when we get closer to the bubble.. more aggressive play, more all-ins, blind stealing become more often.    WHAT DO YOU USUALLY DO AT THIS POINT?   The problem in playing very close to the bubble is that everyone puts pressure on you. the big stacks raises all the time. short stacks raise in early and middle position (Gus Hansen in his ""Every hand revealed"" book has a special chapter called ""beware of the small stacks all-ins). If you reach this point with a decent stack, what do you usually do. according to my experience, you should change your success criteria. Instead of how many times I reach the money? to how many times I reach the final table? As you mentioned above, the real money is in the final table. I believe its profitable to win 1-5 place every 5 games then winning the game every time with just double the buy-in. regarding not get into the money - don't worry. The statistics is working pretty good (and even) on every one including you. At the end, you will have bad days, people get lucky and so.  I think that in the long term you should try and reach deeper in the tournament even if the price is loosing some other tournaments. Amigal  "
What is the min-raise and min-reraise in Holdem No Limit?,"First off, make sure not to call a ""bet"" a ""raise"". If you can check, that is you aren't facing an amount you have to call, then when you put in chips it is called a bet. If you have to put in some amount of chips to continue with the hand, and you want to increase the pot, it's called a raise. If it is confusing, just remember this old poker adage: ""You can't raise yourself."" In No-Limit Hold'em, the minimum bet is usually the big blind. The minimum raise is going to be the amount of the previous bet or raise called. For example, in a 1/2 NL game, the minimum you can raise before the flop is going to be to make $4... you are calling the $2 blind and then raising $2. If you make it four, the next player to act can raise to a minimum of $6... remember you are only raising $2. This can get tricky when a player is all-in. Keep in mind that a player can always push his whole stack into the middle in NL, even if his stack is less than what a min-bet or min-raise would be. The question that arises often is whether a shortstack shove reopens the action to an original bettor. For example, let's say you are playing NL Hold'em with blinds at $1-$2. You are first to act after the flop and you bet $5. A shortstacked player then shoves all-in for $7. Two other players call behind him. Now it's back up to you and you want to reraise. This scenario leads to arguments all of the time and I've seen lots of floor staff get it wrong. Rules are going to be different from place to place, but under the TDA rules, it does not open up the action again to you unless the shortstacked player's raise is at least a full raise. So in the example I gave, the shortstacked player would have to have made it at least $10 for you to be able to reraise when it got back to you. Here is Rule 41 of the TDA : 41:   Raises
A: A raise must be at least the size of the largest
previous bet or raise of the current betting round. If a player raises
50% or more of the previous bet but less than the minimum raise, he
must make a full raise. The raise will be exactly the minimum raise
allowed. B: In no-limit and pot limit, an all-in wager of less than a
full raise does not reopen the betting to a player who has already
acted and is not facing at least a full raise when the action returns
to him. In limit, at least 50% of a full raise is required to re-open
betting for players who have already acted. See Illustration Addendum."
"Is using a ""straddle"" a valid strategy or is it just for fun?","The standard straddle is, in general, a losing proposition. You're trading 2BB for the right to play last preflop. You'll end up playing larger pots out of position, which is a bad thing. You have to have a huge edge against your opposition to make up for the positional disadvantage. Some special situations, where straddling makes sense:"
"In live play, why do poker players wait their turn before looking at their cards?",For me it is not about body language when an opponent looks at his cards. I'm doing a few things when I'm waiting for my turn. As far as the negative of everyone eyes being on you when it's your turn I think this depends on the individual. If I am making a raise it's because of a read on the players or because I have a big hand I'm usually feeling confident either way. It might be wishful thinking but I'd like to think that all the players should be able to see is that I feel confident. If I exhibit this behavior in different situations then the amount of information given away is no longer a problem as it loses its usefulness to the other observant players. 
Why can't folded hands compete for sidepots?,"I liked your question and will try answer it from a different angle. Basically we all agree that when a player fold his/her hand, he/she cannot win any pot.  BUT, one of the major concepts of the game is that one can only win according to what he/she risks. That's why there are side pots, and I think that's why the question was asked - if a player risk enough chips as an all-in player, he/she should be able to compete for that pot I think that the rules was defined as they are today, because it gives more options of play and more flexibility to the game. the following are some examples:
1. give advantage to players with big stack by forcing others out of the hand.
2. give a chance to small stacks (when they know there is a chip bully in the table).
3. knockout games (some of the money is given to the a player that eliminate another player). etc... As I wrote in the beginning, I think the rules are as they are for a good reason, but this theoretical question is quite interesting. Amigal"
Balanced Continuation Bet range,"The proper balance is going to depend on your opponent's tendencies.  Unless both opponents play Game Theory Optimal, there isn't a single correct answer (and even if they both are, we don't know that answer yet!) If you continuation bet the range that you stated, and your opponent starts check/raising a lot, you can adjust by calling those check/raises with a wider range, including any pair.  You would also want to reduce your continuation betting of hands that could draw to a decent hand, but are current useless.  For instance, start checking behind stronger broadway hands that could make a best hand with 2nd pair, or pocket pairs that are somewhere between the top and bottom cards on the flop, while leaving some trash like 54s and 65s that didn't connect in your c-betting range.  This will nearly polarize your range - if you divided your range into 4 sections, you would cbet the top 40% and bottom 20% of your range.  If you get played back at, you can continue with the most of the top of your range, while tossing the trash."
How big an edge can you have on a tournament field ? ROI vs edge question,"The decision is based on the extra equity you gain in the tournament if you win. In the first instance, you have an 80% chance at a 600bb stack, and a 20% chance at not cashing. Your ROI with a 600bb stack would need to go up based on that stack to make the call worthwhile. The breakeven point is The left side of the above equation represents your ROI from calling - it is the 80% chance times your ROI times the advantage you get from a 600bb stack, plus the 20% times your ROI times the advantage you get from no stack (which is 0 - you're out!).  The right side represents your ROI from folding - it stays at 300%. Solving for the advantage variable, you would need at least a 1.25x advantage with 600bb over 300bb to make the call profitable. In the second scenario, .8 becomes .6, and your advantage must be at least 1.66x with the bigger stack."
"How do you bet pre-flop when there's no action, you're on the button, and you have pocket rockets?",The general rule of thumb from me would be to stick with the same raise you would make in the same situation with T9s. You want to balance your range so that you get a good mix of action with your great hands and folds with your steals. What that raise should be will depend a lot on your history with the blinds and on their stack sizes. Whether we are talking about a cash game or a tournament can be a big factor here as well.
What to do if we suspect online poker server is cheating?,"First let me point out I believe this is exceptional: it is definitely not the rule.  Most importantly, I believe the big online sites are fair (and I won lots of money there ; ) I point this out because I won't fall and I'm not going to spread the paranoia: ""zomg, all poker sites are rigged"".  Because they're not.  Most of them are fair: they're winning enough millions with the rake and buy-ins fees so that they don't need to jeopardize their businesses by being shaddy. Yes. Definitely. Such behavior (rogue sites) has been detected in the past and players did force shaddy sites to admit they had: superuser accounts, rigged random number generators, etc. It's however very hard to detect and you need very, very, smart people to be able to analyze gigantic amount of hands and prove the wrongdoing. Yes.  I won't give more info.  That particular site is down now. Yes, but you'd probably need to team up with other players who've been deceived.  There's one underway now: several players are claiming, under the RICO act (where you can claim up to 'x' times your losses), several millions of dollars to the company who operated Absolute Poker / Ultimate Bet (these online sites are down now). Here's one link to that ""recent"" (as I type this) lawsuit: http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/01/20/10194014-poker-players-sue-to-get-to-the-bottom-of-online-cheating-scheme That said, if you could prove something like this and if the site were to operate under a licence, you probably could also contact the organization in charge of issuing the licence and complain there.  For example if you were to detect that one french site is blatantly cheating and if you can back up your claim, then you could contact the ""ARJEL"" and they'd probably take your research very seriously."
Easy to memorize starting hand strategy,"This is a tiny little chart I made for a few friends who are very new to the game and often can't get their head around how much of a difference one or two pips can make!   Reading the chart: If your hand is unsuited, match your hole cards in the lower left half of the table. If your hand is suited, match your hole cards in the upper right half of the table. If you have a pair, you're looking at the dividing line going diagonally. Notes about the chart: It's important that there is no ""formula for winning"". Just take some guidelines, practice practice practice, and you'll start to know when you can afford to play the ""reds"" and how hard you should be pushing those yellows."
Is it advantageous to buy into a NL cash game at the maximum amount?,"Is there an inherent advantage/disadvantage to having a larger stack than your opponent in a cash game? No. There is no advantage nor disadvantage, because you play for his stack, not yours. If you have 75 BBs and he has 40 BBs, the maximum you can win is 40 BBs, the rest of 35 BBs being returned to you. I would think if you expect to have a skill advantage over the table, you would want your stack to be as big as the biggest stack at the table so you can maximize your potential winnings. However, going into a random cash game where you don't know any of the players, would it be wise to buy in at half the max buyin so your maximum potential loss is smaller? Here, there is a longer discussion and, by the way you ask the question, I suspect that you have a much stronger background in tournament play than in cash games. As you might know, in cash games, the blinds never increase. As you might know as well, in cash games you can buy in for any amount which is between two fixed amounts, set by the casino. However, in cash games the pots grow almost geometrically, so it's not very hard to go all-in by the river, if you really want it to. As an example, if you raise preflop to 3 BBs, you get a caller and on each street you bet the pot, after the river betting occurs, you would have invested 107 BBs from your stack into the pot.  The implications of what I said earlier are these: if you have a short stack (40 BBs), then, because the pot grows geometrically, it will be very easy to go all in. In the worse case you'll go all-in on the turn, because you have little money to play. This means that you are forced to play big hands, because you need to win now. There is even a known, mechanical strategy, called short stack strategy, designed to play if you have little money behind. Although it's mechanical and you cannot make big mistakes, it's not a huge money maker. The difference between high and low cards, difference known as the gap principle is huge. If you play speculative hands, you will not win enough to compensate for the frequent losses due to the fact that you missed. If you buy full stack (100 BBs), you'll have more money to play, it will be harder to go all-in, so you don't need all the time to have big cards. You can also play speculative hands that can form a monster hand and win the opponent's entire stack. Here, you can risk 3 BBs here, 3 BBs there because, in the most cases you'll miss, you would have risked 3% of your stack. The gap between high and low cards is lower than in the short stack scenario. If you hit and stack off your 100BBs opponents, it's more than enough to show a profit. If you buy deep stack (100+ BBs), then the game is much more skewed towards speculative hand play. The gap here is so low, that you will almost never see AA or KK going all-in post flop, unimproved. Because you have so much money behind, on the long term it pays off waiting for a big hand (full house or quads) and shipping the money into the middle. As the stacks increase, you need to me more skilled at play to be profitable in the long run. Anybody can shove KK being short stacked, but not anybody can maneuver his 250 BBs opponent into shoving his full house into the hero's quads. The amount you buy-in going at a random cash game should reflect, IMHO, the skills and confidence that you have. If you want to test the waters, buy in short stacked and play mechanically. However, if you trust in your game, buy in the maximum allowed at that game. Don't think about the potential loss, think about the potential gain that you can have. If you are as good as Phil Ivey, you wouldn't think twice in going into a table full of unknown players and buying in for the max amount. To answer your initial question, my opinion is that yes, it's more advantageous buying in for the max, because you can win as much as you can. I hope it helped. Good luck!"

What was the fifth card of the dead man's hand?,"First of all, what is the dead man's hand? From Wikipedia;  The make up of poker's dead man's hand has varied through the years.
Currently, the dead man's hand is described as a two-pair poker hand
consisting of A♣A♠8♣8♠. Along with an unknown ""hole""
card, these were the cards reportedly held by ""Old West"" folk hero,
lawman and gunfighter, Wild Bill Hickok, when he was assassinated. In the fift card section on the same page; In accounts that mention two aces and eights, there are various claims
regarding the identity of Hickok's fifth card, suggestions that he had
discarded one card or that the draw was interrupted by the shooting
and Hickok therefore never received his fifth card. Historical displays in the town of Deadwood, including one in a
reconstruction of the original saloon, display the 9⋄ as
the fifth card. The Lucky Nugget Gambling Hall, at the historic site
of Nuttal & Mann's Saloon, displays a J⋄ instead. The
Adams Museum in Deadwood has a display that claims to be the actual
Bulldog Squeezers Playing Cards held by Hickok ( A⋄ , A♣, 8♥, 8♠, and the Q♥).
The old Stardust Casino on the Las Vegas Strip had used a 5⋄
in related displays. As we can see, there are a lot of rumor about this subject. Also there is a web site called DeadMansHand.us; The earliest known reference to a dead man's poker hand is from 1886
and it is there described as three jacks and a pair of tens. It was,
however, not a reference to Wild Bill Hickok's hand. Although the
evidence is lacking, it is generally ""accepted"" that Hickok's hand was
A♠, A♣, 8♠ and 8♣. There are many claims as
to what the fifth card was and there is even reason to believe that it
had been discarded and that Bill was drawing his final card when he
was shot dead. Whether the fifth card was queen of diamonds, jack of
diamonds, five of diamonds, nine of diamonds or queen of clubs, all of
which have been suggested in various contexts, it is likely that
Hickok was already holding the winning hand and that the fifth card would not have changed anything. tl;dr Unfortunately, we never know what was the fifth card!"
How to improve betting skills without losing too much money in the process,"You hinted at the answer in the last line of your question: play online for low stakes. Unless you are in Utah or Washington (or there's another state that criminalized online play which I somehow never heard about), then you do still have access to real money online play - just not at Pokerstars or the other sites that used to be big in the US. You can still play at a site on the Merge Network (like Carbon Poker or Black Chip Poker) or a site on the Revolution Gaming Network (like Lock Poker or Cake Poker). Another option would be to subscribe to an poker training site and study everything you can find about the concepts that interest you.  Being the owner, I am biased, but I highly recommend Grinderschool Low Stakes Poker Training for this if you want to go down that road. We offer a fairly comprehensive guide to mastering all the basic concepts of each game type, and have hundreds of videos exploring other specific concepts after that basic mastery is cemented. There are other training sites as well, like DeucesCracked and CardRunners but I suspect they are focused on a higher play level than what you're currently seeking."
Are mucked and burnt cards significant in odds calculation?,"No, those cards have no significance to odds calculation. If I shuffle a fresh deck, what is the chance the the top card is the Ace of Spades?  1 in 52.  If I deal off the top 10 cards face down, what is the chance that the card on top now is the Ace of Spades?  Still 1 in 52.  The same probability will apply to the rest of the cards in the deck, including the King of spades, etc, down to the 2 of spades.  Since there are 13 total spades, the chance that the card on top is a spade will be 13 in 52, or 1 in 4, no matter how many cards you deal (face down) first. In fact, you could deal off 51 cards face down, and the chance that the final remaining card is a spade would be 1 in 4."
"Does the ""top 5 cards"" rule apply to a flush? [duplicate]","First: as amigal said, Alice wins. I just want to say something about the naming convention of the hands. Alice and Bob do not have a ""flush to 10""; that would imply that the cards are consecutive and that would be a straight flush. Alice's and Bob's hand - out of context - would be called a ""Ten-high flush"". As amigal said, if the highest card of a flush is shared between two players, the second-highest card is compared and if they match too it goes all the way down to the fifth card. You could call Alice's hand - in this context - a ""Ten-Nine-Eight-Seven-Five-High Flush"" and Bob's hand a ""Ten-Nine-Eight-Seven-Four-High Flush"". By the way: the only way that a flush leads to a split pot in Texas Hold'em is if all players play the whole flush from the community cards. About your second question: it is generally not the sum of the cards that determines the winning hand but the highest card. So a flush with (A 3) T 9 8 would beat a flush with (K Q) T 9 8 - even if the sum is higher on the second. In your example however, the sum is higher in the winning hand."
How to deal with a table that always calls?,"Focus on playing hands that have polarized showdown value. High flush draws and pocket pairs (preflop) are good examples. Basically, against passive callers, the difficulty is that you don't gain information about what they have during the hand, so you have to play only hands where you can be sure you're either leading or losing with high certainty, and then get huge +EV out of those (due to the inherent statistical irrationality of calling in most situations). Dominating draws are particularly sweet, because passive callers will lose more when they actually make it. Don't limp, you want FEWER players in each hand you're playing when you're aggressive and everybody else is passive. The situation you're describing where multiple players are (irrationally) calling and chasing a draw, with one of them usually making it in the end, is called implicit collusion, and very often is -EV for the lead bettor. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morton%27s_theorem . You need to isolate one or two players and make them pay post-flop, especially the worst offenders. This is where preflop position matters. You can often isolate a passive caller with an out-of-position three-bet.  Raise big on the turn if you're leading but don't think you can call a big raise on the river (e.g. top-top). Against amateurs, you can get more folds on the turn than on the flop (and certainly compared to the river), because amateurs usually think they're paying to see two more cards when they call a bet on the flop (outs x4%) when in fact they're paying for one. You also usually have a better idea of what they're drawing to compared to the flop. Don't bluff weak boards. The problem as you say is that they can call with two over-cards, and if you're OOP you've turned a pot you might have had a chance of winning to something where you'll basically always have to fold because you assume they called with a strong hand (i.e. you paid for bad information). Against people who only play their hands and don't do re-raises, just bluff very strong boards (e.g. K Q Q) when your hand has basically no outs."
What are the odds I will hit my flush? [duplicate],"After the flop you've seen 4 cards of your suit, and 1 of another suit. This leaves 9 cards of your suit, and 38 of a different suit; your odds of completing your flush on the turn are thus 9/47, or 19.14%. If the turn hasn't completed your flush, your odds of completing it on the river are 9/46, or 19.5%. This means that the total odds for completing a flush - which should matter for example if you're going all in after the flop - are (19.14%) + (19.5%*(1-19.14%)) = 34.96% (the odds of completing on the turn, plus the odds of completing on the river times the odds of not completing on the turn)."
The more advice I read - the worse I play. What am I doing wrong?,"I have a friend who often relates a similar story to me. (The friend is not me, but has been in the past!) As always, as detailed as this is, it's never the whole story. My friend will be playing and winning at a reasonable rate, then the reverse... at a reasonable rate. When they're winning they often attribute it to the quality of their ability, and when they lose they often attribute it to bad luck. A common bias. Their particular story often involves relating what they've seen in High Stakes TV shows, and stating how the decisions presented are practically identical to their own. Repeating actions & possessing skill are very different. You may be reading, and indeed doing what these books suggest, but it's likely that you're not digging into the concepts & heuristics that are the foundations of the decisions. For example, a plain hand history often won't retell the past play, opponent dynamics or skillset, whether Hero has balanced his lines, etc. Of course, the truth is that what might appear to be true, only scratches the surface of the decision. Emulation is not mastery. Hard rules are good for processes you deeply understand, but ask yourself: Are you really there yet? and whether liberating yourself to explore is better at this stage of your development? It often is at all stages. Tiger Woods (Golf) changed his technique when he was world no.1, as did Phil Taylor (Darts). Just two of many examples. Poker can likely be classed a discrete skill like these sports. I'd suggest a couple of things, each has helped me a great deal. The first is focusing on one concept at a time, and I do mean concept. Your working memory is finite, don't overload it. Sure, read the books all the way through, but remind yourself that they're for education, not entertainment. Go back to the beginning and study the examples, paying attention to the concept. Work with it, test it, manipulate it in ways you think are wrong and right just to experiment. The second is, do more to learn how to learn. Meta-Learning. This might've been the first point but it makes sense as an example of how to tackle point one. People commonly read, watch, listen to so much that there's a fear of missing out if you don't take it all in. They take an example, read it once or twice, and then move to the next with the full intention of applying the ideas presented. What actually happens is, because of the amount of new tools to play with, it ends up being emulation and not an attempt at mastery. Look at why you get a result from doing ""this & that"", and less on the how to get a result from doing ""this & that"". If you do, you'll also find out why not! As a personal example, starting with the bigger fundamental concepts like position, value bet vs bluff bet, I went through the first ""Easy Game Vol 1 by Andrew Seidman"" book, chapter by chapter doing this, applying what I thought each concept was at increasingly detailed levels. I soon found out that, when I moved a chapter further on, what I thought I knew wasn't actually clear. And so I went back a chapter. Rinse, repeat.  I hope this helps a bit. As a side note, I thought this was interesting when you mentioned ""My style was pretty much supertight until I started winning and then loose until I started losing"". Perhaps you were winning because you were supertight, and changing to a looser game actually hurt your game. I'd be digging into why one worked better than the other."
What is the usual ruling on an aggressor folding on the river?,"None of the answers here get it quite right. Here's the complete scoop: Yes, Alice paid full price to see Bob's hand, and she's entitled to see it. The fact that she has shown her own hand is of no consequence; ""order of show"" rules only apply to situations where players are reluctant to show. Players are always encouraged to show their hands at showdown as quickly as possible. Bob is entitled to fold without showing, and the dealer should place Bob's hand in the muck if he releases it. Alice may (and probably should) then take the pot without further ado. If Alice requests that the dealer show Bob's hand before it hits the muck, the dealer should do so. Her right to see the hand overrides Bob's right to conceal it. The dealer will NOT kill the hand, and the hand is live, so Alice's request is at her own peril. (The hand WILL be killed if anyone other than Alice asks to see it). If Bob's cards are in the muck, but clearly identifiable, Alice may ask a floorman to retrieve them (the dealer should not do this on his own). The floorman may very well remove cards from the muck if he believes Bob acted specifically to deprive Alice of the right to see a hand she paid full price to see, but is not required to do so."
Pocket pair starting hands vs. probability of opponent having a pocket pair,"First off, I believe it is easier to understand the probability of getting dealt a pocket pair this way: Your first card can be any of 52 cards, so it is not relevant in the calculation. The 2nd card must be one of the 3 cards that match the value of your other card. There are 51 cards left in the deck now, so the probability of being dealt a pocket pair is 3/51 = 1/17 = 5.88%. Another way to think about this is that you should be dealt a pocket pair, on average, once every 17 hands. It's difficult to answer your question as to why the probability ""seems too high"", since the numbers won't seem high to someone who lives and breathes probabilities. But perhaps this will help: At a 10 person table you're getting 10 tries at a 1/17 shot. The chance of at least 1 person getting a pocket pair is 45%. So maybe now it's easier to see that the likelihood of 2 or more getting a pocket pair is less than 45%, but not ""much"" less."
Does a bounty chop?,"According to my experience It depends.... If going all in three way handed and the loosing player has the low stack, the other two players split the bounty.  If the loosing player has more chips than one of the other players, the bounty is not split
and ""goes"" to the player with the high stack. I know you didn't ask but to complete the answer.. in split pot games like Omaha hi-low and 
7-stud hi-low, the bounty is always earned by the winner of the high hand. Regards,
Amigal  "
Effect of number of players in the probability distribution of poker hands,"This can not be true... A flush is always better than a straight, no matter how many players there are at the table. Now, if you're talking about a higher probability of a player to have a flush instead of a straight... this depends on a lot of factors... and by a lot I mean a lot: All these factors influence what hands are folded and which are not. Which means that the probability of a player having a flush or a straight is greatly changed. Now, if everyone plays their hand and goes to the river, like you said, then the probabilities stay the same. There are 4 cards of the same rank and 13 cards of the same color. If the dealer is shuffling properly, then there's the same probability for each player to get J♣ or K⋄ or 3♣ etc. Let's say there are 3 players at the table. If you give them 3 random cards (1 to each), then it means that there is: 25 % FOR EACH SUIT, right ? This means that, on average, there will be X number of hearts left in the deck, X number of clubs, X number of spades and X number of diamonds. I don't know how much X is and it doesn't matter. All that matters is that X is the same for each suit. Now, let's do it for 8 players. If you give 1 random card to each one, there will be: It's the same 25 %. In this case, on average, there will be Y number of hearts left in the deck, Y number of clubs, Y number of spades and Y number of diamonds. This means that, just as in the case of 3 players, Y is the same for every suit. Now here's the key point: The next time you want to give to each of your 3 OR 8 players a card, the probability for each of them of getting a club, diamond, heart or spade is still 1/4, EVEN THOUGH there may be more or less cards in the deck. This also applies to the community cards. And to the different ranks of cards as well (not just the suits). Which means that there's the same chance of someone making a straight or a flush when there 3 players at the table or 8 players. So, bottom line:"
"How do I Calculate Expected Value of Shoving, including Fold Equity, in heads up play?","This will be pretty messy if I don't define some variables, so here goes: When he calls and you win, you earn: P$ + S$ When he calls and you lose, you lose: S$ So, if he always called, your EV would be: EV = (W% * (P$ + S$)) - ((1 - W%) * S$) But he doesn't always call. When he doesn't call, you win: P$ So we can add that into the above: EV = (F% * P$) + (1 - F%) * ((W% * (P$ + S$)) - ((1 - W%) * S$)) I used this formula for the basis of a Expected Value Calculator web-app at Grinderschool, which calculates EV, Required Fold %, and Required Win % given any/all of the variables represented in this equation."
Can the optimal strategy for low stakes holdem be considered simpler as a general rule?,"Many years ago I struggled to play at micro stakes level because the level of the players was so bad...
Anyway, once you adapt to it, it's actually really really really easy to win at those micro stakes.
If you want to play ABC poker, then go play on low stakes, just outside the micro stake region.
Remember, at any level there will be fishes, and one does not bluff a fish!"
What does 'freerolling' mean?,"It's a term used to describe a situation in which there is no more downside risk involved for one or more active participants, only upside positive outcomes can be realized. A ""shot to nothing"" is a similar expression.  In the example from the question you link to, both players currently have the best hand, an Ace-high straight, yet only one player also has a flush draw. That player is freerolling as he can't lose (no downside risk) but can still beat his opponent by improving to a flush (upside).  In the context of poker, a freeroll is an opportunity to play with no cost, yet there are still potential rewards. Hence, any similar situation could be thought of as a chance at freerolling. "

Starting hands probability,"When you are dealt a card, it has 13 possible ranks. When you are dealt a second card, for it not to be a pocket pair, that can be of any rank different to your first hole card - i.e. 12 different card ranks. For the division by 2, the calculations are for the number of combinations of different types of hands and a combination disregards order. If you take 13 * 12 you get each possible non-paired hand twice, e.g., AK and KA or 74 and 47, so you divide by 2 to count each combo only once. Thus the equation 13 × 12 ÷ 2 = 78. For the 12 possible (suit combinations for each hand) for (unsuited cards nonpaired) hand shape equation, the 4 represents the number of suits and the 3 represents the number of suits any single suit can be paired with to give an offsuit combination. Four suits x three combinations each = 12 combinations total. The equation is not a fraction, the 1 in the equations is not a denominator. The symbol with brackets such as (4 1) is for the number of combinations of 4 things taken 1 at a time. "
Simplified poker games,"Games that are closer to ""real"" poker would not be simple enough to be solved. Recent research seems to be mostly focused on HU LHE and programming AI bots to play Game Theoretic Optimally. Most of this work seems to come out of the University of Alberta's Computer Poker Research Group. You can find their publications here.  One game that is closer to real poker, but not so complex as to be unsolvable is Rhode Island Hold'em. You can read more about it here. Even in this game, there are 3.1 billion nodes. Here are some related articles that may be of interest:  By the way, there's nothing to stop you from creating your own simplified poker games that are closer to ""real"" poker, and solving them yourself. Obvious changes you can do are removing streets, removing cards, capping the raises at a lower number of bets. It should be an enlightening exercise."

Profitability of re-buys/add-ons when allowed,"Math on standard re-buys is that they are basically always profitable if you were profitable to enter the tournament in the first place. For flat payout structures rebuys are profitable because the $/chip value is higher for small stacks compared to big stacks. (Read up on ICM if you are not familiar with the concept.) This does not apply to your tournament tough, since it is basically winner-takes all. But there appears to be a huge overlay in your tournament, so rebuys are definitely very profitable there as well. Unsurprisingly, your math tells you that rebuying becomes break-even in winner-takes-all tournaments as soon as there is no more overlay."
"Trying to express NL betting rules formally, did I miss anything?","Chris is right. A raise reopens the betting if and only if the raise is a legal (more than twice the size of the previous raise) raise. I am concerned about the logic here: ""The OP remains unchanged"" -> the player who ""raised"" is now the person who made the all-in raise, and play continues around the rest of the table, and back to his right, but no one who has already called the bet is allowed to re-open. Any other player still can. From a logic standpoint it seems like you made a little mistake, since it sounds like the people in between the first raiser and the all-in raiser will not have to call the new bet."

Thoughts on Chen's formula,"In the end, any formulaic starting hand strategy is going to suffer from major weaknesses due to the fact that it fails to make the proper adjustments for the specific players you are playing against. Chen's formula is no exception. If you're just starting out, this provides as good a strategy as any for giving you a place to start. It will point you in the right direction for the vast majority of hands. The few major complaints I have with specifics of the strategy are:"
Are There Good Points-Based Ways To Handicap Home Poker Tournaments?,"I'll give a known ranking procedure and a handicapping example further down. Pokerstars awards the points to the top 15% of players in a tournament based on this calculation: Where:   Here's an example of theirs: A player takes third place in a $20 tournament with a field of 150 players.   You could expand the awarded points to cover whatever percentage of the field you like. If you wanted to you could use this scoring system to establish a handicap by judging how players Actually perform vs how you Expect them to perform at random, and then adjust the points they receive post-tournament taking into account their handicap. For example: A player takes second place in your 0 Dollar/Points tournament with a field of 10 players. You award the top 30% of players some points. Here (aside from the answer, rounding all calcs to 3 decimals): You then take his Actual points, divide them by his Expected points (random) and you can see how much better (or worse) the player is against random chance. Here: or the player is about 0.15 (15%) better than random. You could adjust his score after the game based on this, giving or taking some points away. That was much longer than I anticipated :D I hope it gives you some good ideas."
Stalling as a strategy in real life tournaments?,"This is an excellent question. Seriously. One of the top on this site. You can use this technique, especially in multi-table tournaments and heads'up situations. But you have to be very aware of its consequences. Some reasons why you could do this: 1). piss other players off. This works both online and live. If you constantly take 2 - 3 or more minutes to decide what to do, the other players will feel frustrated and you can throw them off their game. It's how I won a couple of heads'up situations. In fact, I believe it's more effective heads'up, since most players are tired at that point and want to just end it. 2). If the tournament is getting closer to the bubble and your stack is below average, you could stall in order to increase the chance of other short stacks at the other tables busting out. Generally, in this situation, I don't recommend such a strategy, since it's a losing one. What you should do instead is put pressure at the other players. They tend to tighten up as the bubble approaches and they fold a lot of hands. Collecting blinds at this stage is very valuable. But, if you find yourself at a table with more skilled players than you, it can be a surviving strategy. By stalling, an orbit at your table could take 20 minutes. But at other tables, it takes 12 minutes. Which means the blinds at the other tables will eat at the stacks quicker, especially at the short stacks. This increases the chance that they'll bust before you, which might get you closer to the money. Yes, Hand-for-Hand play will kill this at some point, but remember that Hand-for-Hand doesn't come into play until the actual bubble. 3). It's not recommended to do this often (see below why), but by stalling, you could take some extra time to weigh your decision. Even if you reached a decison, taking an extra minute or two can't really hurt, since there's a more than reasonable chance that you'll remember another past hand or the cards your opponent showed 1 hour ago or figure out that you just saw one of his bluffing tells. These new facts can be proven to be very valuable and they might actually change your decision by 180 degrees. Now, about why you shouldn't do nr. 3 too often: This can be easily identified as a tell. Doing it for the reason I mentioned above (to be more sure about your decision) can tell your opponent that you have something marginal: a hand with some value, but not very much. Not a bluff, but not the nuts either. Most likely a coin-flip situation. This can really narrow down your range, which is definitely what you don't want. I know he's out of the picture these days, but does anyone remember Chris Ferguson ? (WSOP Player of the Year in 2000). One of the things that makes him good is that he doesn't have reaction time tells. This means that every decision takes X seconds, no matter what hand he has. If he's bluffing, it will take him X seconds to do it. If he has the absolute nuts: X seconds. If he' on a coin flip: X seconds. Having such a tell is not something I would recommend. Unfortunately, most players have it. But hiding it like Ferguson does can really put your opponent(s) at a test when they want to put you on a hand. Obviously, point nr. 1 is the most important and most useful reason to stall. Be careful, though. And learn the rules of the tournament / casino where you're playing. There's a chance they have something like this in their rule book. As for existing oficial rules: I only know the ones at WSOP (long live TV :D ). At WSOP, you can take as long as you want to make a decision. Literally. I once saw someone thinking what to do on the flop for 15 minutes (!!) That's right: 15 minutes (I think it was Pius Heinz last year at the Main Event final table, but I'm not sure). If another player at the table calls the clock on you, you have 1 minute to make a decision or your hand will be folded. FYI: in the late stages of tournaments at WSOP, you'll never see someone do that (call the clock). The reasons for this is beyond the scope of this answer."
What topical resources do you often use to learn more about poker?,"You're right: this site definitely has potential... if only it would be more popular. Besides books and videos and tutorials, a very good choice is to be part of poker communities. Discussions about poker in these communities vary from beginner to expert, texas hold'em to razz and badugi and much more. So beeing active in such a community can only be good for you. Reading books about the subject (and practicing what they teach you) is a powerful and efficient way to learn. But when that situation comes along (and it comes quite often) where you don't know what to do (even after the hand is over), you need people to talk to about it. Brainstorming about controversial decisions in poker is more important than in any other field. I had a good experience with PokerStrategy when it comes to this. They have a section where you can post hands and have expert players evaluate them and give you feedback about what you did well and how you can improve your play when that particular situation occurs. This format just... works."

"Do you have any ""in-hand"" thinking procedures?","Probably but these ""thinking procedures"" only apply when given a hand to analyse. When you're sitting at a table, you're aware of everyone's stack sizes, positions, previous actions, table image, etc. all the time so the only things that you really look at in each hand are the pot size and the two cards you put players on.  Then, depending on who's in the pot and how many players are in the pot, I think of what I want to do with that hand. Am I interested in this pot or not? If yes, then how do I want to take it down? How can I take it down?  When the flop comes down I can refine my strategy, maybe bet for value or bet to protect my hand by pricing out whoever is in the hand with a worse hand but chasing for a better one. Or maybe I can trap the other players and take down a huge pot? A lot depends on the other players too. Do I recognize any betting patterns? What does my table image look like to them? Is bluffing an option?"
How to stay alert during long tournaments,"Great Question, some things that I find useful are the following:"

Why is Texas Hold'em Poker so popular in worldwide not just US?,"I believe this to be a very complicated set of factors... I'll try to mention a few, but not all of them, since I'm not old enough to know them :D. Texas Hold'em is definitely the most popular; so popular in fact, that most people don't even know about other types of poker. If you want to be a more serious poker player, you should definitely try other variations. Start with Omaha, since it's the one closest to Texas Hold'em. Learn a few strategies there. Then move on to Stud. Learn why that is such a different animal. Now here's the key: when you come back to Texas Hold'em, you'll realize that you actually became a much better Texas Hold'em player by learning the other ones. PS: If Doyle Brunson sees this, please make an account and give us more historical reasons why Texas Hold'em is so popular. The rest of us are too young to know :) ."
How to make the most of a very good hand when you've been playing conservatively?,"It depends! What are your definitions of ""conservatively"" and ""good hand"" and ""couple of chips""?  And how long had you been playing at this game, allowing your opponents to develop an impression of your play? First, you can't make any generalizations based on this single hand. The fact that you got dealt AA doesn't entitle you to win a big pot. It could well be that you played your hand just fine and nobody else happened to have a hand with which to challenge your opening raise. It happens sometimes. You just have to sigh and smile as the dealer pushes the blinds your way. But, maybe it's a pattern. Based on your description of your opponents' reaction to your bet, it sounds like you might be playing in a nitty way where you are waiting for premium starting hands. If this is true, and your opponents know it's true, then your best course of action is to selectively widen your opening hand ranges. If, for example, you're opening with things like: 88+, ATs+, KJs+, AQo+ That's only about 7% of hands. If your opponents have seen you playing for a while, perceive your tight play, and have seen you show a few premium hands at showdown, they are going to be noticeably reluctant to enter one of the few pots when you open. You can take advantage of this reputation by open raising with a wider range of hands, particularly in later position. Exactly how best to do this isn't so clear, since it depends on so many different factors: opponent tendencies, stack sizes, your absolute position, your position relative to other key players in the hand, etc. Getting the most out of your position is something that distinguishes elite players from the rest of us, and it's a learning process that gives a little boost each time you learn more. In general, tight play can often win at lower limit cash games like typical live $1-$2 games and against certain player types, but you can do better. Do some searching on the web for articles on how your hand selection should vary with position, and learn how to mix it up a little at a time. I stress that you should do it a little at a time, because it's easy to get lost when you try to play a lot more hands without the skills to back it up. An excellent book that describes benefits of position and other common concerns in modern smaller no-limit cash games is Ed Miller's Small Stakes No-Limit Hold 'Em. IMO, you can't go wrong with this or any of Ed Miller's other books."
How to determine the winning hands in poker?,"Each player in a basic game of poker is given five cards to make their hand. There are variants to the game where players receive more than five cards and players have community cards. However it is the best five cards of a player's hand that make their hand. If the best five cards you have are not better than another player's best five cards you lose the pot. If your five best five cards are the same as another player's best five cards you split the pot.    The hand rankings for five card poker games. Suits all rank the same. In other words no particular flush is better than another particular flush of the same five cards because one is of a particular suit. Kickers only count when they are part of the best five cards. A better sixth card has no bearing whatsoever in determining a winning hand.  Whatever the poker game is: it is always the best five cards. However there can be variations with community card games as to where those best five cards are. In Texas Holdem all players have seven cards, the two hole cards in their hand and the five community cards that make up the board. Your best five cards are the best five of any of those seven cards.  With Omaha games your best five cards must consist of two cards in your hand and three cards on the board. It is not the best five cards of the nine cards you hold.  In other variants of poker such as five card draw, Seven card stud etc. Where you posses all your cards the best five cards rule still applies.  There are variants of poker that use other than the five card rule. Texas Holdem and Omaha do not use other than the five card rule. There is no condition in a five card hand where you can win the pot based on your sixth or seventh card. There are no tie breakers unless your best five cards are better than your opponents best five cards.  When both players have one pair or two pair that tie, kickers determine the best five cards. Only the highest straight wins, not the longest straight. Straights and flushes do not have kickers*. *The term kicker is slang that describes the next card in the five card hand when a player has one or two pair. Example is AA234, the kicker is the 4. AA345, the kicker is the 5. The five is the key card that determines the best hand, commonly called the kicker.  Examples are almost futile. There are virtually an unlimited number of hands possible. The best five cards of a hand are a simple formula of what the best five cards in your hand are. It is very basic, if your confused it is because you are reading into it more than it entails. There can only be five best cards to make a hand and they either beat, tie your opponents best five cards or are not better than your opponents hand. Any thing beyond five cards is simple never used to determine the outcome. The hand rankings list above in this post is truncated. To provide a perfectly granulated list would require several more hours of typing, you need to be able to fill in the blanks. (The best five cards) You simply need to know it is the best five cards, nothing more and nothing less. You should also understand that the five card rule is an abstract rule that only covers certain forms of poker and that there are other forms of poker have nothing to do with the five card rule. There are also variations on the five card rules that one should have a basic understanding of before they play a game.

Is online poker still a profitable way to make money in 2014?,"Absolutely. Obviously the games are dryer and tougher than 2005-2008 but that was the golden era of poker due to the Moneymaker boom. United States v. Scheinberg, more commonly known as Black Friday, was a huge blow to online poker but it's still thriving due to the rest of the world still being able to play online poker. :) PokerStars is doing great, tons of promotions, a good amount of fish, lots of games to choose from, and so on. Full Tilt Poker is back up and running and US players are getting their rolls back. There are tons of people making serious money playing online poker. I myself approach it as a part-time job and know quite a few heads-up players like myself that grind out some significant coin. If you put in the time grinding, studying, and reviewing your play you'll be better than the vast majority of players out there which, over the long run, will result in $$$. On August 1st, 2014, Amaya Gaming Group, completed their purchase of the parent company of PokerStars/Full Tilt. This has resulted in serious changes, some of which I've listed below: The increased rake will result in high-stakes professionals losing tens of thousands, for nosebleed stakes potentially over a $100k, of profit to PokerStars due to the increased rake. I myself, a mid-stakes players, would have lost another ~$2600 USD to PokerStars so far this year if these new rake percentages were in effect. This is likely going to cause a large amount of regulars/professionals to move to other sites or they'll quit playing poker professionally entirely. Amaya is really screwing over a lot of regs with this. Also, Spin & Gos, which are a HUGE hit among recreational players, are so high variance that it's borderline impossible for any serious reg to make a living playing them, ESPECIALLY with the high rake. As such, this is a serious blow for online poker.  Note that all of these changes are likely due to Amaya trying to get into the US market. Increased fees & rake to pay for lobbying efforts, taxes, etc. Still, they're driving away a huge part of their customer base by doing this. Hopefully things work out in the long run. Here's an excellent article on how all of this was motivated by the desire to return to the US market, and how it's likely that PokerStars will be back in it soon: In the booming online poker business, Amaya will raise you billions "
"Are non-standard verbal declarations such as ""same bet"" or ""I put you all-in"" binding?","The floorman will rule in the spirit of the game. Most of the time, that should mean that if a verbal action was in turn, and understood, then it is binding. If it is ambiguous, or denotes an action not possible, clarification may be called for. The precise words don't matter. I once ruled that the words ""Back atcha"" constituted a re-raise, because in the context of the game at that time it was clear to all that he meant it that way. I would certainly rule that way for ""I put you all in."" That's totally clear: it means ""I bet whatever amount is in your stack"". Heads up, that's the same as ""all in"", but if there's a third player, it's not. I'd certainly hold a player to it if, for example, he didn't realize there was a third player. I would also probably rule ""same bet"" to be binding if everyone agreed what that amount was. If the dealer didn't remember, I might have to fall back on the physical action. It's certainly not the dealer's place to claim that such a declaration is ""not a real bet"". As Jon notes above, ""intent"" is not relevant. It is appearance that matters. If everyone understood the action, and acted on that understanding, it must hold. As also noted above, the worst common case is the ""check?"" question. I think it is especially important for dealers to clarify this immediately."
Quantifying the amount of luck required to win a tournament,"The common conditions/rules of being independent from luck in the tournament: 1) You are playing tournament with deep stacks and reasonable blind level lengths. It means turbo tournaments with 5 minutes per level contain enough luck-dependent situations. Not playing ""turbos"" will allow to avoid rapid short stack preflop all-in situation. 2) You don't ignore your opponent's push diapason, nor his image, nor any other aspects of tournament play. In this case typically the worst situation you will face: AQ vs KJ, where you are up to 60% ahead of your opponent. 3) Tending to have chip leader stack (or near it) at least on your table. In this case preflop  allin 50/50 will not be fatal for you.  4) And finally: try to win without showdown as much as you can, which is a poker basics.  Taking into account these factors will reduce the influence of luck in the tournament to a minimum. Update:
(Answering the comment from @TTT below the post). To measure the ""luck"" component of tournament play you can do the following: p.s.
I am not sure that calculating this number for another players (data mining) could be enough helpful, because it will present other players' winning chance and reflect their playing style. But at least you will see what this numbers approximately could be. p.p.s.
It would be really interesting to compare your ""lucky"" number with another players and get your playing style closer to the best of them. But this is something related to using another players' hands history... what is not fair :)"
When should you defend your big blind in tournament play?,Basically it depends on some factors: General Big Blind behaviour:
Is it possible to play for real money online in the US?,"As of October 2017, the two biggest places for US players to play are currently on sites that are part of either the Pai Wang Luo Network (such as Ignition Casino and Bovada Poker) or the Winning Poker Network (such as America's Cardroom, Black Chip Poker and True Poker). Both sets of sites get a reasonable amount of traffic. PWL Network does not offer much in the way of rewards or rakeback, but it has anonymous tables that prevent player tracking and thus the games are quite soft. WPN has a high rewards VIP program or a 27% rakeback program. Most importantly, both options still accept US players. I have deposited with them using my credit card in the past, and more recently using Bitcoin. According to The Merkle, America's Cardroom just started accepting over 60 cryptocurrencies on top of Bitcoin. It is also worth noting that Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware have passed laws to license and regulate intrastate online poker. This created a number of new options for players residing in those states, who had access to both regulated state sanctioned games and offshore poker site games regulated in foreign jurisdictions. Just recently, the Governor of New Jersey signed an agreement with DE and NV to combine and share player pools in all three states."
Looking for the BB/M math to build good NLHE Tourney Blind Structures,"The rule of thumb I've always heard is that tournaments tend to end when there are around 10 big blinds left on the table. You will need to know the number of players you will have, your starting blind level and stack size, and your desired tournament length.  Generally, you will not want to start with deep stacks for a short tournament.  The final blind level can be calculated by dividing the total chips in play by 10.  Finally, you will need to determine how long you want levels to last - longer levels will require bigger increases in blinds at each level. If you are hosting a 9 person tournament, and you want it to run 3 hours, starting with 1000 chip stacks, the big blind 3 hours is in should be (1000 * 9 / 10) = 900.  We can approximate this to 500/1000 for ease. So blinds need to increase to 500/1000 in 180 minutes.  With 20 minute levels (with typical 9 handed play, that should be at least an orbit per level), you can either go linearly or exponentially to 500/1000. The linear method is terrible - starting around 5/10 blinds, the structure would end up looking something like: The exponential method is better... it looks something like this: To solve for A, we plug in our number of levels for L, and our final big blind for BBL Next, we run the formula for each level, rounding to the nearest decent chip amount, to find the big blind at that level As you can see, this is a pretty solid progression.  The 1.5 that is used in the equation is basically a multiplier for each successive level of blinds - the blinds for level X will about about 1.5x the blinds of level X-1.  For smaller earlier blinds and faster leveling, adjust the 1.5 number up.  I would suggest keeping it below 2 - changing it by .1 can greatly affect the structure.  You can also lower it a bit to get a more linear structure."
What determines who finishes in a paid position after Hand-for-Hand play?,"Whomever had the most chips at the beginning of the hand places best in the tournament. The number of players or tables does not matter, it just the same as three people going all in on a single table and two bust out. Whomever had the most chips at the beginning of the hand places highest.  On the bubble the same thing, if there are 101 players left and it is hand by hand, two people go busted, the one with the least number of chips has finished out of the money at 101th place, the other guy with the most starting chips finishes at 100th in the money. If it is discovered that they both started with exactly the same number of chips, rare but it happens, they split the prize money for the places they placed in. In my example they would just split whatever in 100th place. If they were a little better, like say 88 and 89th place the prizes for the two spots would be added together then split between them."
Is there a situation where just calling is justified with AK on a QKA suited flop?,"When you bet and you get raised, is there a situation where it is justified to just call instead of raising or folding?  In general I would say no. Lets think about this for each scenario. Passive Fish
A passive fishy player re-raises you on the flop, you should fold. Passive fish are calling stations, not raisers. When they raise it is because they a strong. Even if by some bizarre miracle you do have them beat currently, what turn/river cards are you ever going to like? Any 8,9,10,J,Q or any spade is going to put you in a bad spot, so why call here to fold later? Agro Fish
OK so now you have a player who likes to throw terrible bluffs out. However Agro fish tend to bet/give up when they have nothing or just barrel off each street. They rarely re-raise without a huge draw. Agro fish are renowned for calling crap pre-flop like K2s or J7o that smash this board.  And again ask yourself if you call here, what turn/river cards are you likely to see? You can guarantee that if one of these cards do hit, your agro-fish will fire again and are you going to like that? TAG
A tag re-raising you on this flop is almost always hitting the board very hard. I am thinking two pair, sets or better. At the very least they have AK or a good spade. These players tend to have tighter, stronger ranges so when they re-raise it is usually a very strong hand. And again if they just have top pair, are you going to give action knowing you face bets on the turn and river when bad cards hit? And even if a brick hits, are you still confident you are ahead? LAG
LAG's tend to be aggressive but disciplined enough to fire and forget. They play a loose style so again a lot of hands in his range smash this board. A LAG will raise you with nothing but a straight draw here since they know it is highly unlikely that you flopped a flush and you will be scared by a lot of turn/river cards. And a LAG is going to put pressure on you whenever a scare card hits, so again why call? You either fold or raise. NIT
If a NIT ever re-raises you, not just in this spot but ever. Burn your cards, throw them away do not ever call here. NIT's only play super strong hands and would only ever re-raise you here with the nuts its that simple. Don't raise, don't call, don't even think about your hand, Fold! Now going over the above you can start to form a very good picture of what the answer to your general question is. Never call here  you are almost always up against worse hands with huge equity, or hands that simply crush you.  A question you should ask yourself and not just here but any hand you play is, if I call here am I confident I can win the hand profitably? I think if your honest, the answer is no and so folding or raising are your best options.  Calling to hit a miracle A or K is just bad poker imo. Now that I have made the point. Are you convinced? If not just answer these questions: You flat his 3bet and then a spade hits. Now what do you do? You flat his 3bet and an 8,9,10,J or Q hit. Now what do you do? You flat and a brick hits the turn, you check or raise and he 3bets or shoves. Now what do you do?"
NL600: River Decision OOP vs Thinking Regular At Very Wet Board,"I think the only way you're beat here is if villain turned a flush.  With such a wet board, I think villain would have pushed QQ+, sets, 2 pair, or a straight earlier in the hand.  Since our line doesn't look too strong, when he calls the turn bet, he could be calling with any pair (even a lower pocket pair), and even overs with a gutshot, planning to re-evaluate the turn. We are way ahead hands I think he could get to the river with: As for our river action, if we check and he bets, we will beat enough of his paired T, 8 and 9 hands that he could value bet to offset the flushes.  If we choose to bet, we need to figure out what his calling range will be, and what his raising range will be?  So far, our line is indicative of: Given that range for us, it will probably be tough for him to call with a hand that we beat.  Also, given our fairly wide range, I think it would be pretty bad for villain to bluff raise here - I think that we would have to fold to a raise. Since villain will be able to value bet more hands than he can call a bet with, I'd check/call any reasonable bet (less than $100)."
Tough decision on the turn,"This is an interesting question. I think you've played right pre-flop. I think the continuation bet is right post flop usually, but your stack size I think means you need to either push all-in or check-(call/fold). Against one opponent I would push in this instance. Considering the second opponent here is the BB-special, I'd probably still push. It's unlikely they've hit the Queen, and you've just got to hope your caller on the button isn't sitting on high pockets or has hit the queen. Perhaps the button caller has a wideish range because they've got position and are unlikely to be re-raised in this spot. Regarding your question about what to do on the turn, I don't think calling is a terrible option here, assuming they haven't hit the set and they've only hit the Queen, you've still got 5 cards in the deck (3 As and 2 Ts) which will be winners for you. You're paying for 23% or so odds, you're getting around 12%, which isn't horrible (that's assuming they've hit the Queen). With implied odds there's a whole lot of hands like J9s or even KT that they may have called 25% of the pot just to see what comes around on the turn, and they've pushed when they've sensed weakness. I think AT is the worse hand you call with in this situation. I'd throw away KT (unless I had a flush draw), but AT is decent. It's just too easy here for villain to push if you're folding 2nd top pair with top kicker. I'd call unless villain generally doesn't bluff. Edit: On second thoughts, I've forgot about the antes. With the antes, I think your preflop raise is too small. I have a habit of raising the pot pre-flop. There's no evidence I've got that this is the best way, but anything less seems to let drawing hands cheaply call. In this case, raising the pot is betting 1900. Now, it's worth thinking what you'd do if someone comes over the top with an all-in (lets say the button). The pot will contain 10775 in chips, you'll have to invest your 5875 to call. This is a hard fold to make. You only need 35% odds to call here (ignoring bubble factor). You're slightly behind a pocket Tens to Kings (30%) and you're a bit more behind Ace King-Jack (25%). On King-any other you're in front (60%), and you're still getting better than your odds against pockets lower than 9 (45%). I tend to think if you're in a situation where you're struggling to fold to a reraise, you might as well be the one that goes all in, lest your opponent has the advantage of determining the size of the pot. With 1100 in the pot pre-flop, and a stack of 7775, you're probably in push fold territory. Push here and steal the blinds. If there was no ante, a raise to 1400 to steal 600 still gives you room to fold to a 3-bet whilst being strong enough to make the BB think seriously about calling. If they do call, you're in push/fold on the flop. Raising to only 1000 pre-flop I think makes the button assume the BB will call, so entices the button to call with drawing hands."
Is using American Sign Language against the English-only rule?,"This is not the first time I have asked this question. I think it is interesting and important to the poker industry. I had an email exchange with a friend of mine about a year ago about this. My friend was a poker dealer for about ten years and since has become an ASL interpreter over the last 20 years or so. We really did not draw a conclusion, here is our conversation. Me: So something came up at work today that made me think of you. I do believe that you may be the most qualified person in the world to answer this question. We had a group of five deaf people who communicated with ASL sit in the game today. One of the other players was a little uneasy with the signing during a hand, or so I was told, one of my dealers said something to the deaf people. The deaf players took it ok, it was not a real problem. So me, the dealer and the card room assistant manger had a little off to the side debate about it. We of course have the English only rule at the table. The manager and the dealer argued that the rule was in effect. I argued that the deaf people had legal protection, and that the protection trumps the English only rule. I said that if push came to shove, like if someone had told them they could not sign at the table and if they did they could not play in the poker game, that doing so would leave us in violation of the ADA*.
I have some other thoughts on the whole issue but I would like to hear what you think since you are more qualified.
*American With Disabilities Act. Friend: I am not the most qualified, but I'll give it my best shot. ADA states you must provide ""reasonable"" accommodations. You have an English only rule at the table. Is that any time, in and out of a hand? If so, this is where the accommodation applies. Deaf people need to be able to communicate in sign, but only if they are not in a hand. During the hand the English only rule applies to all, including those using sign to communicate. If you had five deaf people at the table and they were used to playing at home fun poker, they could violate so many rules unintentionally, and that is unfair to those who don't understand sign language. So, if the deaf person had a question or wanted to make a comment (What is that river card? How many chips does he have left?), a notepad could be provided and the dealer could read it aloud. By the same token, though, it would be fair to communicate back if someone says something at the table that gives an advantage for the hearing customers that the deaf person would miss (knowing realistically, though, that would slow up the game). Some deaf people read lips and speak, too. There may be advantages of signing but disadvantages of not hearing, so being somewhat flexible and forgiving during the hand would be an accommodation also, like if a spouse came up to talk for a minute or if the person forgets and signs because that is how he/she naturally communicates, and that will happen, just as with players who native language is other than English; it's only natural. It would be great if the shift manager could learn a few basic signs to give a gentle reminder of the rule. You may want to also change your rule from English only to English speaking only (if in a hand), as not all deaf people use ASL; some sign in English! This is my opinion only and it would probably be best to meet with the casino attorney and an ADA representative to ensure you are complying.
One other thing...some deaf/hard of hearing people talk and sign at the same time; the signing just helps them ""hear"" each other better, so if that is the case that should be allowed during a hand. Me: I drew a different conclusion from you on this. Remember there was no incident.
If I was advocating for the deaf person, I would argue a couple things were wrong with saying they can’t sign during a hand. 
First I would argue that signing does not break the intent of the rule, which is not to keep people from communicating but to prevent people from colluding with each other. Sign language is recorded by the camera they really could not get away with collusion without leaving evidence. Someone speaking a foreign language could get away with it because once they spoke what they said is gone, a none language speaker could certainly not remember what they said, there is no way to know if what they said was related to the hand or not. Sign language in other words is not suitable as a code language the same way as a foreign language is.
The rule does not protect a deaf person at all. If the hearing customer’s complaint is that they do not understand what is being said is legitimate it can also be stated that the deaf person cannot understand what is being said, actually they have a bigger threat to the security of their game then the hearing player. Yet the deaf person has a burden of obeying a rule that does nothing to protect them. What I am getting at with this, is that allowing people to talk is as insecure or more to the deaf players as allowing deaf people to sign is to the hearing players, therefore telling the deaf they cannot sign is just lopsided. 
You mentioned the ADA term of reasonable accommodation. I think it is unreasonable accommodation to tell a deaf person that they cannot communicate what is normal to them, especially when such a ban leaves the deaf person at the same disadvantage the hearing person is complaining they are at. Communicating and sign language is not the same as communicating in a none English language. I would say that the rule only applies to verbal language.
I would argue that the way we reasonably accommodate everyone is subjecting sign language to video review rather than banning sign language. I think it places everyone on a more level playing field. friend: Interesting perspective. I like it; I had forgotten how intelligent and compassionate you were. To play devil’s advocate…
If a hearing person breaches the rule that leaves the deaf person(s) at a disadvantage, it is instantly heard and as a reasonable accommodation that could/should immediately be communicated (in writing?) to the deaf person(s). However, if a deaf person does this, no one knows until there is a complaint. Then, you have to, what, stop the game, hire an interpreter, wait for the interpreter to arrive to review the video and, if it isn't resolved at that point, take further steps? This seems quite expensive with lost time and costs incurred, and not reasonable. Suppose it is a friendly low limit game and two deaf players and three hearing players  are in a hand and the deaf players are just chatting in sign language and one happens to win the hand. All it takes is one person to say, “I think they were colluding” to begin the above procedure. 
Aside from collusion, I know that much about the game can still leave a deaf person at a disadvantage in general, as we learn much from conversations (a hearing player who knows no English would be at a somewhat similar disadvantage). However, we also learn a great deal, and some say more, from body language and tells. As a former sign language interpreter and teacher who had many deaf students in her class, I feel honored to have learned so much about Deaf Culture and have a great respect for it and I agree, it is not right to prohibit players from chatting in a language that is natural for them if they cannot communicate in spoken English but, along those lines, as a former English learner teacher I feel the same in that this should then also apply to hearing players who speak no English whatsoever (I have dealt hands in this situation). Is it fair to not allow them what is natural, too? No, but casinos prohibit it. Why wouldn't the same, then, apply to deaf persons who communicate in ASL, recognized as a language other than English (even with the video review option)? Neither is perhaps right but not only one should be enforced. The purpose of ADA is so that persons with disabilities have equal access as much as possible with their disability, not to have preferential treatment (i.e., a teacher who doesn't know sign allowing two deaf students to sign with each other during a lecture but not allowing the hearing students to talk to each other). Again, if a casino enforces the English only rule it should only be during a hand. You allow persons to communicate in their native languages if they are not in a hand, don’t you? I hope so!
BTW, I have witnessed deaf students and have been informed about  hearing English learners communicating in their native languages innocently and unknowingly exchanging information they shouldn't and they just needed a gentle reminder but I have also witnessed and been informed about a few intentionally colluding by using their native languages because they thought no one was aware of their conversations.
Remember, all of this is just some alternate thoughts on the matter from me and, ultimately, worthless. In addition to having this discussion with the casino attorney and an ADA representative, it would be important to include deaf poker players. I was going to ask some deaf and hearing people I know qualified to comment on ADA and deaf rights but I don’t believe they understand the culture of poker and that would be important."
When to fold AA pre-flop?,"Theoretically, no.  For every dollar you and your opponent add to the pot, you stand to win your dollar back plus some of his, regardless of his hand.  However there are a few practical edge-cases worth considering. Trusting the game If this is your first time playing in a home game, there are a few ways this could be a mistake.  The first is cheating; there is a small, generally negligent chance that the dealer and player you are in against are working together.  He could have KK, and the dealer could base-deal a third King.  Even without knowing that you won't get an ace as well and still win, this makes the odds of you winning very slim.  The second is if you will get paid or robbed before you leave the game.  Consider a situation where you've been winning all night in a deep game and now sit with 2000BBs.  Some home games let players buy in for the largest stack on the table, and if this player is playing on credit, the home game could give you a long run-around for getting your money.  The player who loses to you could also have friends in the area planning on taking this money back. Your stack is your net worth You shouldn't be buying in with a stack that you can't lose.  If you have $1000 to your name, you shouldn't be playing 5-10.  Though it's still possible to win up to this amount.  Consider you have $10,000 in your bankroll, and decide to take a very aggressive shot at 5-10 with 1 buy-in.  If you lose it, you will move back to 2-5.  But then the shot goes very well, and you run your $1000 up to $8000 or so.  Most of the time, you should stand up.  But let's also pretend it's a very soft table; someone is buying in for $1000 and losing it every hand with no sign of stopping.  There may be a situation here that warrants folding AA against a different player; the value in the game so great that you don't want to leave, but you also don't want to take a 20% shot of losing roughly half of your net worth."
How is Poker a game of skill?,"You're missing the whole betting process, which is key in poker.  Cards are dealt randomly, but afterwards, the players will wager on the strength of their hand until one of two things happen: all players but one have folded their hands or;  the latest bet have been called by everyone still at the table. So if you are a winning poker player, your betting will be such that: players holding worse hands than yours will continue and /or, players holding better hands than your will fold.  In other words, a lot of hands will never go to showdown and when they do, it is not rare that the player who wins the pot is not the one who had the best hand to start with."
NL100: 2-Pair In 4-Way Pot Facing OOP Lead @ Wet Flop,"When he donkbets the flop his range likely consists of strong draws, pair+FD, pair+gutter, and some strong made hands like AT+. Reads on CO and BTN are important - if either of them is a fish he could have a wider value range. If CO and BTN are regs I expect his range to be pretty damn strong. Either way, I think flatting flop is best since we don't really feel good stacking off against the above range because we're either slightly ahead, flipping, or crushed.  OTT his bet sizing is probably a tell of some sort. I don't like reading into bet sizing too much vs regs I don't know but I will say that I think it's unlikely he'll bet this size with strong made hands and fairly likely he'll bet this size with draws or hands like TP+draw. With a stronger read about his bet sizing a turn raise could definitely be the best option (and still might be) but I don't mind flatting again. The river is essentially a brick since I doubt he flats J9s preflop (I have VPIP/PFR similar to his but I play Full Ring, which means I'm looser and I definitely don't flat J9s preflop in his spot). It doesn't really make sense for him to check this river with a better hand than ours because he'd be missing out on a lot of value (we look like we'll check this river back a lot, or possibly bluff a whiffed draw of our own). So basically he's super likely to have a whiffed draw and possibly TP to go along with it, so I'd bet around $24 for value from hands like AJ. It's pretty thin, but I don't see him taking a c/c (or c/r) line with a better hand."
"Do I have to show my hand in an ""All-In"" situation?",You also have to take into account whether you are playing a tournament or Cashgame.
Why did I lose this hand?,"In all poker hands not only the highest card determinates the better hand, all cards do.  The best five card hand you can form is K:diamonds: J:diamonds: 8:diamonds: 6:diamonds: 2:diamonds: (which is the board). The best hand your opponent can form however is  K:diamonds: J:diamonds: T:diamonds: 9:diamonds: 8:diamonds: So, while you both have the King and the Jack, he has the Ten as the third best card, which is better than your third best card, which is the Eight."
"All-in, pre-flop with AK... twice. Was that a bad decision?","If your laying down AK to a loose cannon that is raising all in all the time you are making a huge mistake. These calls you made all in were just fine. You will get the guy sooner or later. The 99 he had you were slightly behind but for the Qx you dominated.  I will sometimes get out of games like this, usually because I am not able to get the guy and getting tilted like you were, or I just do not have the bankroll to play this game. But if I have bankroll and I am feeling OK this is the game I want. This guy is going to bust out and then I am going to have a table full of tilted players with a lot of big stacks around the table."
Drawing Dead Preflop?,"This is an interesting question. The key consideration to me is ""Player A cannot win the pot via a split pot"", meaning that there should be no scenario whereby the board contains the nuts. This is essentially the error with the 2 answers above. IF the board comes A♠2♠3♠4♠5♠, then someone other than player A needs to be holding the 6♠, otherwise it is a split pot. same for straights on the board (i.e. 7♠8♣9♠ T♥J♥). In that scenario, someone other than player A needs to hold a Q. (or KQ if player A holds a Q). edit: I thought it required 20, but I think I have a solution with 8. Player 1: 4♠4♣ Player 2: 5♠5♣ Player 3: 5♦5♥ Player 4: T♥4♥ Player 5: T♦4♦ Player 6: T♠T♣ Player 7: A♦A♥ Player 8: A♠A♣ All TTTT5555 are in villians' hands, therefore there are no possible straight/straightflush options for the board (every straight will have to hold either a 5 or a T). All Aces are in villians' hands, therefore it is not possible to splitpot with a 4 of a kind nuts on the board (i.e. KKKKA or any XXXXA combination). Player A cannot draw to straight (no 5s), flush, set, or hope to play the board and split. Player A is drawing dead."
Do I call a turn all-in with KK with against a possible flush?,"The reason we need opponent tendencies here is to come up with an accurate preflop range to call a 3 bet with.  I would default it to JJ+, AQs+, AKo. You are behind AA, possibly with a redraw to a flush if he doesn't have the A♠, behind QQ with a redraw, and you have the rest crushed. His AK and AQ hands can't be flushes yet. Adding AsJs strengthens his range, but as long as his JJ and AK/AQ hands bluff the flush card,"
Should I have bet this river? - KK vs potential flush,"You were unlucky that Villain hits his flush on runner-runner. This frequently happen on micro-stakes where the play takes check-check and someones hits his K♠2♥ 2-pair on river and beat opponent's Q⋄Q♠ Your 3-bet raise PF was weak, you should 3-bet raise him $0.08 (3BB+1). $0.06 is a typical opening raise where no one limped yet, which he might call if he's loose (tip; he is). If i sense he is a loose-fish, i raise even more. Also you need to take care and not over-do it; sometimes this limp translates to AA for check-raise PF. The Flop is quite harmless; what do you think Villain has? a 3 or AA or set? Don't allow him do that and re-raise strongly. If he has a 3 then bad luck, congratulate him for his very nice calling hand A3x, K3x (/sarcasm) and move on. You're not against AA also, he'll re-raise you down to TT since this seems like that kind of player. And if you're against set, boy, you're just unlucky since most good players would also lose lots of money on this since it's damn tiny chance of one hitting a full-house on the Flop. You should take the risk and bet large/check-raise large in this pot. Don't fear that he entered with a 3. These kind of players are so bad, they will check the Flop and check-raise with a 3, or donk the Flop otherwise if they sense their 77 is still good on this Flop or perhaps they prefer to semi-bluff.  So, bet more Preflop (to avoid others entering as well, don't give them the odds) and bet close-to-pot on any Flop. Also on Turn i would take a stab by representing a Q as well, and not only for $0.55 but all-in, thus allowing him to make a mistake and call, since you're willing to commit anyway, why the $0.55? By the looks, he is bound to make the mistake 110% of the time. You were unlucky at the end but this happens so frequently on poker."
What is the maximum number of players in Texas Hold'em?,"The ideal max number at a regular-size table is 9 players and a dealer. 10 is also not uncommon. Some larger tournaments will occasionally place 11 at a table in the early stages until the field is narrowed a little.  Any more than that and you'll have a game that is super tight, both in terms of the poker and the space available to you. The theoretical max at a table is limited only by the number of cards available in the deck.  52 cards, and 8 are used up as part of the board (5 cards shown plus 3 total burn cards). That leaves 44 cards remaining, and each player gets 2 of them, so I guess you could have 22 players if you had a big table and skinny people. Of course, a game like this would be no fun for anyone, dealer or players."
Talking during a hand,"I am angered enough at the other two answers here to move my comments to an actual attempt at an answer. I think they really miss the point.  In short: This behavior from the big blind is illegal collusion and deserving of a penalty. The intent of the BB here is obviously to signal to the SB that he is no threat in the hand. That's a big deal.  This is a tournament right at the cash bubble, and this all-in from the short stack is a pivotal point in the game. Communicating like this at this time in the game is 100% collusion, and that should result in some kind of penalty from the hosts. The BB and SB gain tremendously from this behavior if it's allowed. When the short stack shoves all-in from the button, here are the possible outcomes (I'm assuming approximately equal SB and BB stacks, that they both cover the short stack by a reasonable margin, and that any reraise from SB or BB will be an all-in raise here.  I'm also assuming a really low stack-to-pot ratio, since that's how these small tourneys work at the end.): SB is next to act, so he's faced with a decision. He has two threats: the all-in short stack and the BB to his left.  Even if he thinks he will fare well against the short stack, he must still fear the potential of a shove from the BB to his left. This is potentially a huge threat and may tip the scales toward outcome 1 or 2, and might also reduce the likelihood of outcome 5. Before the BB's comment, the lack of information protects the short stack somewhat.  In fact, good short stacked tournament players will often rely on this very effect to enable more effective short stack play. Now, let's inject BB's mouthy comment. What happens now? BB is saying effectively that he's choosing not to play this pot, and he wants to give SB information that will help him make the best decision about whether to try to eliminate the all-in.  With this info, the SB now has no care in the world about the BB. He need not fear for his own stack. He can concentrate solely on the all-in's shoving range and his own cards and the stack sizes as if he's last to act. This will allow him to call with a wider range and attempt to eliminate the short stack. The short stack's shoving range is likely really wide here too, so calling with a more marginal hand might still be a good idea. The fact that the BB is no longer an issue is a huge deal. My point is that this is not just some random jerk talking about his hand during the hand. This is a player trying to put the short stack at an unfair disadvantage by giving extremely valuable and inappropriate information to another player. I can't find details about specific penalties that have been applied for collusion, and you don't really provide enough info that might point out mitigating circumstances (for example, if the SB had a huge stack and the BB just barely covered the all-in, he doesn't really pose the same existential threat to the SB as he otherwise might), so it's hard to tell how severe the penalty should be.  The WSOP rules on collusion (#39-A and E, and #102) include topics like this, though they leave the penalties to the discretion of the tournament director. All I can say is that I hope the BB at least bought you a beer after this."
Why is it easier to make a flush than a straight with four cards already matching?,"For an open-ended straight draw, there are exactly 8 cards that will give you your straight: 4 of each suit at the low end, and 4 of each suit at the high end.  However, to make a flush, you have 9 cards available that will make your flush, as there are 13 cards to a suit, and you have 4 of them in your hand. At 3 cards to the set (again assuming an outside straight), you now have 16 cards that will help you make your straight (four of each suit for the two cards over, and four of each suit for the two cards lower, assuming you don't have a king or 3 as part of your three).  Not every combination of those 16 will be applicable (if you have 5-6-7, a 9 and a 4 won't help, for example), yet with a flush, there are only 10 that will help you (13 to the suit minus the 3 you already have). All in all, at 3 to a straight there are 48 combinations of cards that will make your straight (assuming 2 possible over cards and 2 possible under cards).  At 3 to a flush, though, there are only 45 combinations of cards that will make your flush."
How does Lo work in Omaha Hi-Lo,"Omaha Hi-Lo is also referred to as Omaha Eight-or-better.  The 8 is the important bit - it means that only hands where all five cards are <= 8 can play as the low. The nut (best) low hand is The Wheel. This is A2345. Suits don't matter - a flushing hand is the same as a rainbow. The worst qualifying low hand is 45678. The highest card in the hand counts 'first'. By that I mean that a hand such as A2348 is worse than e.g. 34567 - the former is an 8-high hand and the latter is a 7-high, so the latter wins. If the highest card is the same, we want the second highest to be lower, and so forth, e.g. A2367 will win over A2567. Edit: I forgot to mention; a low hand can only have one card of each rank. A hand such as AA234 cannot play - only hands with 5 distinct ranks up to 8."
Pot odds with low chip stack,"There are many elements of information that are vital to know here. Some of them are, Technically, if the cost of a call compared to the current pot doesn't offer favourable odds, in this case you assume equity of 2.33:1 (or 30%), then the Pot-Odds aren't in your favour. The example you give, and the statement ""but the pot odds are in favor,..."", don't make logical sense. The call amount and the pot total are inextricably linked to Pot-Odds. Using the example again, the pot would have to total T$1631 or more for a call of T$700 to be correct, if you knew your equity was 30%. Importantly, depending on what you think your equity is determines if the explicit Pot-Odds are correct. You're right to assume that a call in this scenario is a bad decision. Also, there is no need for a revised theory as the original calculation of pot odds accounts for what you're talking about already. Check out this question on pot odds, and this question on Implied odds to get a better understanding. Good luck. :)"
Implied odds meaning and usage,"To understand Implied Odds (IO) it's useful to clarify what It's counterpart is, Explicit Odds (EO).  EO describes how much you will win immediately in relation to what you have to risk. This is described in terms of a ratio, Total pot size : Amount we have to call. For example, current pot size is $50. Your opponent bets $50. Therefore, the current pot size is $100, and you must call $50. EO = $100 : $50 = 2 : 1 IO describes how much you will win on future streets if you hit the hand you are drawing to. It's calculated similarly to EO except you add what your opponent has left (accounting for effective stack sizes), not including his current bet, to the current pot size. Total pot size (+opponents effective stack) : Amount we have to call. For example, current pot size is $50. Your opponent bets $50. Therefore, the current pot size is $100, and you must call $50. Opponent has effectively $50 left.  IO = $100 (+$50) : $50 = 3 : 1 Importantly, this particular IO calculation assumes that you will win the entirety of what your opponent has left. This obviously won't always be the case. That's where your judgement comes in. ""If I call now, how much more can I win from villain on future streets?"". The part of the calculation regarding the opponents remaining stack is subjective.  It's worth noting that there exists a third paradigm of pot odds, and that is Reverse Implied Odds (RIO). These odds describe how much you will lose on future streets if you hit the hand you are drawing to. If you're already the favorite in the hand, then this applies to your opponent. It's wise to consider the possibility that the hand you're drawing to may not be best, even when you make it.  Using these tools will help you decide whether to continue in a hand or not. Which is to say you should be using them every hand you ever play."
Should I have called an all-in with KK against a TAG?,"Yes, you might be 80% against a random hand, but unless he really is just gambling on his last hand (how can you know?) his likely range will significantly lower your odds. For example: You're getting pot odds of 42%. Your card odds are around 18% if he's only ever shoving AA in this spot, around 23% if he's shoving AA or KK, and 50% if he's shoving AA, KK or QQ. If you think he can do it with AK suited, cards odds improve to 52%. The argument for laying down:
A nitty player might only shove AA or KK in this particular spot so laying down might well be profitable. Either way against most players you're never averaging 80% and you're a dog to a lot of players who might only make such a large 4 bet with AA or KK. The argument for a call: Using the same calcs as above, if you yourself are three betting a lot, or are likely to three bet with a wide range, villain might play QQ and a suited AK this way to end the pot there and then- he has blockers which might make this a profitable play for him. Similarly if he is a bad player, or a loose player who thinks he can get you to call with lower pairs or AKs might shove a wider range still. Then, there are scenarios where he is almost outright bluffing with 89 suited and using his tight table image to his advantage. These factors mean you should probably be calling against most players and against most opponents this is a +EV play.  A lot of players will just snap call with KK regardless and, while not optimal, this will be a profitable play. There will, however, be some players against whom calling here is not a +EV play. If you can spot these players and make these folds, you can certainly increase your profitability at the table. The fact that you folded KK in this spot seems to me that you read him as a player who is too nitty to be making this play with anything less than AA or KK, so this may well have been a good fold long-term and certainly isn't horrible play."
Are there well documented cases of winning tournament by someone who wasn't looking at his own cards?,Annette Obrestad did this a few years ago. A quick google search finds an article where she discusses her win and a youtube video of the tournament she played: http://www.bluffeurope.com/interview/en/Annette-Obrestad-Eyes-Wide-Shut_3379.aspx http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dax6w3RgDWA
looking to see what card would have come,"This is called ""rabbit hunting,"" or just ""rabbiting."" Many casinos and card rooms explicitly prohibit it in their ""rules and regulations"" document (example). If you want to try your luck with asking individual dealers to bend the rules... well, do so at your own risk. For home games, there's no single definitive rule about whether rabbiting is allowed or prohibited. You can set the house rule either way. Just make sure everyone knows what it is ahead of time."
What is the purpose of blinds?,"There is nothing ""unfair"" when it comes to the blinds, because the blinds ""go over"" all the players at the table in a Round Robin method. The blinds have some purposes, the most important of which are: Regards,
Amigal EDIT: this part is added as a response to your comment. Ante is a very aggressive way of force players to commit chips. ANTE is as used as long as the tournaments continues. usually, an ante is not used in cash games. 
To make things a little bit clearer - there are some games (like 7 stud, 7 stud hi-low, razz ) that ANTE is part of the initial payments. regarding the third point: players perform sometimes unexpected moves like big raises or All-in. those moves are sometimes used as a tool to cause all other players to fold their hands. By doing so, they earn the pot. regarding the forth point - buy-in is usually for tournaments. For cash game we have the size of the blinds to tell us if we can afford ourselves to participate in the table."
Optimal Win Rate Standard Deviation,"Typically, live play will mean you're seeing between 30-50 hands per hour. In your case, this will mean that you've seen somewhere in the region of 7,000 hands. This is an incredibly low number to make any significant, reliable assumptions about the StDev of your win-rate. The data set simply isn't large enough to be approaching what we'd consider a normal distribution yet. As for your question, ""Is this high standard deviation just an expression of the volatility of low limit cash games, or is this my problem?""...It's just too early to tell! Commonly... Check out this post for some helpful Statistical Tools for analysis of your game."
Dealing with Rookie / Novice Players,"Firstly, you should realize that when you're playing against novice players you're in a good situation because it'll be easier to capitalize on their mistakes (since they'll tend to make more of them than experienced players).  Secondly, their playing styles are very important - not all novice players play the same (in fact, not all novice players online with the same VPIP/PFR play the same, but that's off-topic). Regardless of who you're playing against, whenever you're in a hand you should be putting your opponents on a range on hands (i.e. a set of possible hands they may have based on their previous actions). The more you play, the more accurately you'll be able to solidify their range of hands and sometimes you can narrow it down to a single holding. Novice players tend to have wider ranges of hands, so you need to account for that while you play. The best way to learn ""how to account for that"" is to post hand examples and have people who are better poker players than you explain what they would do. But, some general advice: You can oftentimes value bet more thinly. Novice opponents oftentimes have a tough time folding weak made hands, and will overplay hands like top-pair top kicker. Exploit these plays by making more value-bets with hands that you might check back with versus better players. Charge heavily for draws. Novice players often will call big bets with a draw when they aren't getting the proper (direct or implied) odds. Raise their limps and take advantage of position. If they like to call and see flops, make sure you're the one benefiting from all of the times they call preflop and c/f when they miss. Again, if you ask me, specific hands are the best way to learn how to play against these guys, but hopefully this post helps."
Is shoving all in with a weaker player the best strategy?,"Obviously, the nuance you're considering is valid. Our ability to outplay this opponent and whether that is more valuable in the long run than just taking a more volatile approach and trying to get stacks in now is worth considering. That said... A8s is approximately within the top 13% of hands depending on how you use hand rankings but it's very close whichever way you look at it. In this instance, your opponent would have to restrict his calling range to approximately 7% of all hands to be a ~55% favourite, give or take a small adjustment because of the blinds already in play. If you believe he'll call wider than 7%, that's great, shoving is +EV. You can't predict the run of hands you'll get in the future so make the most of a good situation as soon as you can! Waiting for other opportunities later in the tournament is a decision I'd base more on experience, as equity calculations make this a straight forward. n.b. Hand 0 = Top ~13%; Hand 1 = Top ~7% "
Finding leaks in your game,"One of the easiest things you can look at is which hands are making money and which hands are losing money.  Sort by number of blinds won/lost per hand type if you can, and then start at the bottom.  These are the hands that are losing the most money and are very likely your worst leaks.  You will probably be surprised at which hands you find here!  Either stop playing the hands altogether, or consider HOW you play those hands and see if you can find a better way.  Play a bunch more hands after making your adjustments, reevaluate and adjust again.  Continue this cycle for as long as you play.  There are tons of other things to look at, (including money won/lost by position at the table as Robbie mentions) but this one will get you started and have the biggest payback."
"Do two or more players colluding against honest players gain on average more money, or not?","They have an obvious advantage and so will earn more in the long run, that's pretty clear! Also playing together and playing both separately would lead to the same amount money, so they are not risking more money just together (same argument for the profits.) Now I don't really know to much about collusion and specifically what edge it can give you but I suppose situations such as this would be pretty profitable. Assuming they share all the money at the end lets and imagine (for simplicity) we have only 3 players. Colluding Player A (A) 500
Colluding Player B (B) 500
Smuck (S)              500 The hands are: Colluding Player A (A) AA Colluding Player B (B) -- Smuck (S)              KJ Blinds 25/50 A SB B-BB S- raises 150 A- Comes over the top all in. Now lets pause and look at the two different situations. I player B was not colluding then he would fold and player S would have the following situation: Pot odds: (700/350)=2:1 so they need a hand with 1/3=33.33% against player A to call. Now that means that they have to put player A on pockets 10 or worse or QJ or worse. This is a pretty easy fold and Player A does not get paid. Now lets suppose that player B is colluding and now also moves all in. Now player S has this situation: Pot odds= 3.3:1 so they need to have a hand that wins 23% of the times to make this call. Player S is much more likely to make this call (based on pot odds) as long as they are not both holding QQ+ or AK, AJ the odds are pretty decent.  Now the colluding players should take the money and both make 250 as opposed to not colluding where player A only takes 200 a profit for both players!! So a bit more accurately assuming a fold in the first case A make +200 In the second A make (500*0.85)/2=212.5 and so does player B (just accounting for when S wins the hand) This is just a toy example of when it can be useful! Thats just one example of how "
"In Wsop, paying taxes depend on what?","These are due to IRS regulations, and it isn't taxes paid, just withheld. The players must declare this money as income, less any deductions, to the IRS and then they can have the difference returned to them. For professional players, if they had losses and expenses to offset some of these winnings, they might get quite a lot of it back - even all of it. That's between them and their accountant and the IRS, the casino is just required to withhold that money. Some countries have tax treaties with the United States and there is no withholding. That is why some players show no tax - but they still have to declare these winnings in their home country and pay taxes there, the casino just isn't required to withhold anything."
NL100: Can I Call This River Shove?,"MY GUT: I can't say I'm a fan of a hero-call here, which is what it feels like. THE NUMBERS: However, PokerStove disagrees.  A range for villain of: { TT+, 77, 33-22, AKs, ATs, KTs+, QTs+, JTs, AKo, ATo, KTo+, QTo+, JTo }  (which is basically sets, better K's, AA, sticky QQ or JJ, 2nd pair, and busted draws) gives hero 56% equity which is way above what's needed to call (178 into 360, or about 33% equity).  I'd have a hard time narrowing villain's range down so much as to justify a fold here. So... my gut vs. numbers?  I'm a big fat chicken on these situations and tend to fold way more often than I should.  I would need a strong read on villain to pull the trigger. Side note: I probably would've check-called the river.  It would widen villain's range by letting him bluff a wider portion of hands, and I don't prefer bloated pots with 1 pair. But I'm no expert, either."
"Micro Stakes, playing Big Aces pre-flop against multiple very loose opponents","There are quite a few things we need to address here. I'm going to do my best to break them down point-by-point. First off... AK is not favorite to win against so many players, is it really profitable in the long run? What should i look for in this 2 situations to decide if it's profitable on the long run? Should i consider play AQ as well in this situations ? I often don't. AK and AQ are typically much stronger than the hands that your opponents will hold (though this will change as you see how your opponents play - some won't play AQ, others may reveal that they only raise with AA/KK). Because these hands are stronger than what your opponents hold, you will win more often than they will each individually win. For playing these hands to be profitable, you don't have to win the majority of the time - you just have to win more than your fair share. Now then, let's look at your first situation (AK in early position getting called by several players when you raise 2x to 3xBB). This is a profitable situation, but it is not as profitable as it could be. With most hands (especially in early position), you would rather face only one opponent. If your raises are routinely called by 3+ players, then your raise is probably not large enough. 2xBB is rarely large enough in any game, and almost never large enough in micro stakes. 3xBB is better, but if it is getting called by a lot of players, raise 4xBB or more. Finally, let's look at facing another player and several callers. Typically, the best play here is going to be to reraise. And your reraise should be pretty big. If the initial raiser put in 3xBB and then 3 more players called, the pot is over 12xBB before it gets to you. With so many people in the pot, your reraise should probably be to 10xBB or more (and shoving all-in is not out of the question). The major thing you want to be careful of is watching to see if the initial raiser only raises strong hands - if so, that can change things and may even warrant just calling to try to make a pair. The general concept is: try to make the pot between you and one other opponent, but if you must play against a lot of opponents, keep the amount you put in small unless you make a pair or better after the flop."
Online play analysis software,"There are two major players in this field: Hold'em Manager and Poker Tracker. Both provide the type of in-depth number crunching and statistical analysis that you're looking for, and they do it way better than anything you would roll on your own. They track things that few players would even think to look at without first seeing the information available in one of these two programs. In my experience, Hold'em Manager has a wider array of options for cash games, giving it a slight edge there. They even have some plugins that can detect strange patterns in your opponent's play and automatically issue notes about those plays. However, something about the way Hold'em Manager imports tournament results is messed up, so that gives Poker Tracker the edge for tournaments."
Giving a short stacked opponent a perfect all-in vs forcing them to over-commit,If your opponent has 10 000 in chips and the blinds are 200/400 your normal raise would be something around 1000 - 1350 which means that it's with the blinds something around 20% of your opponent's stack. He can go All in now and win your bet +  blinds which is not much but can lose a lot (everything) if he gets called by you (or even reraised all in). If he for example would have only 5 000 in chips now this becomes almost 40% which means he is getting almost 2.5:1 odds for his money. If he has any kind of decent hand (any Group 1-3 hand from sklanksy chart) he can go all in because it's profitable for him.  The bottom line is. If your raise will be a bigger portion of your opponents stack he will be priced in to go all in because he can win a lot of chips with a decent hand. If the bet is still too small to give him the right odds for an all in then he will basically bleed away his chips if he keeps calling. This was my understanding from this while I was reading the book. Correct me if I am wrong. :)
What is Teddy KGB's tell?,"When he was bluffing or weak he only broke open the Oreo, but didn't eat them. When he had the best hand or was strong he'd eat the Oreo. Basically he was rewarding himself with a cookie when he made the best hand or was very strong. Also there are a bunch of other tells from the first scene where Mike and KGB play. They're constantly talking trying to act weak, when they're actually strong, by saying things like: ""Position raise. I call.” - KGB ""All right, I’ll call the 2 grand, I’ll gamble."" - Mike ""Okay, Teddy, I’m gonna call you, or else I won’t respect myself
  tomorrow morning."" - Mike Basically trying to plant the idea in the others head they're only playing their hand because of position, or because he wants to gamble, but in fact they're strong and want the other to think they have a weak hand."
"Whats this ""OFC"" game that I keep seeing poker players talking about?",They are talking about Open Face Chinese poker. See the site below if you are interested in learning how to play: How to play open face chinese poker A lot of the top players have started getting hooked on it. Jason Mercier was involved in a 34 hours session or something ridiculous like that. You can also find more information about it on Wikipedia
What is the proper betting procedure with 7 players after the first three players go all in before preflop?,"Outside of casino-specific rules, this follows the standard full minimum raise rule for big bet Holdem. Legal raises (all-in) below the minimum are treated as calls, although players to act face a different bet size than previously. Therefore, a minimum raise by player D presumed to have more than 1200 chips behind, is 1200. If player C were to go all-in for 1199 total, player D could make a legal non-all-in raise to 1200, and player E would still have the option to raise. This seems strange at first, but a raise here is practically the same as a call, both of which retain open action, so the difference is only a technical one. Furthermore, such a raise is seldom advantageous to the raiser, as it tends to offer favorable odds to players yet to act. EDIT: I haven't found a ""Holdem Rules"" that outlines this interpretation with more specificity than ""What is a minimum raise?"" However, some time ago I wrote this logic into a poker engine and verified against existing poker sites, to answer the question: Does a raise over a non-minimum raise go on top of the new facing bet, or does it go on top of the last minimum-qualifying bet? The answer is the latter."
What metrics do you use to evaluate your own live play performance?,"Common metrics from live play, like win-rates, may not be as valuable in the short run as people imagine. That said, players should definitely attempt to keep records with a long term perspective in mind. Here's the problem. Making valuable adjustments to your game based on metrics from live play are difficult because of two main issues: It's mostly because of the volume of hands you play, which is far fewer than online. I'd estimate live will equal around 1/3rd of the volume you could play online per table. (~30-50 hands per table hour live; ~70-80 hands per table hour online). Multi-tabling FTW! I understand that some people (unfortunately) don't have a choice. Check this question and answer to get an idea of what I mean. The accuracy of the information you keep. The ""statistics"" like VPIP, PFR, Aggression stats, etc. are all important but estimates at best if you're not methodically keeping records. The three I mentioned, I'd suggest, are the most valuable anyway. After all, what we're trying to do is read hands with precision, and these help to narrow your understanding of an opponents range. @Jeffrey Blake touches on a valid point in his post. Your decision process is king and although you might not be able to influence your live-play volume that much, you can always adjust your decisions. Assuming you haven't read it, and you want to form your own blueprint for evaluating your live performance, take a look at Gus Hansen's Every Hand Revealed. Here's a decent review link from Pokernews. It's MTT's, not cash games but it's still a good treatise on a top player's analysis and decision making process throughout a whole live-play experience. I've no doubt you'll get some ideas on how to improve your game and how to record it."
Proper way to dispute a dealer's actions,"Your scenario sounds like a dealer that is either really new, not trained well or a blackjack/pai gow dealer switching over to poker.  What surprises me is that the other players at the table where not immediately correcting the dealer while this was happening. Dealers make mistakes all the time.  Stuff happens.  Hands get mucked by accident, etc - I've seen some crazy things. The rule is - the dealer NEVER unilaterally exposes cards that the player did not intend to be exposed. That is information to be exposed at the players discretion and inappropriate disclosure of hole cards can affect the game.  IME, there are two exceptions. The first is the ""show one show all"" rule where if a player shows
hole cards to another player at the table (unless it's a sweater or
rail-bird sitting behind the player) - especially at the end of the
hand - then the entire table is entitled to that information.  This is a common rule. The other is the ""show one card show both cards"" rule where if you
flip one card up you need to show both cards.  This rule is
really rare.  In fact, I've never seen that rule outside of private, friendly home games. What usually happens is that you would point out to the dealer, in a quiet and respectful manner, that you are pretty sure the the dealer should not be turning over the cards.  Usually, other players will chime in and agree with you and provide the basic instruction to the dealer.  This handles about 90% of issues.  If the dealer disagrees with you - or worse, the other players disagree with you - then you should ask a floorman.  Just call a floorman over and ask the question.  This happens all the time and is not considered rude. If the dealer continues to disagree with you then the best way to handle this would be to quietly talk to a floorman on the side and explain the situation.  A good floorman and/or pitboss would take care of it cleanly and professionally without embarrassing the dealer or interrupting the game.  Just never get into an argument with the dealer - it almost never ends well for anyone."
Can a bettor concede his hand without showing it?,"Although customary, you can muck before showing your hand. I've seen this happen on WSoP (two players in the hand, winner mucked his low pair, figuring he was beat, the winner showed high card and took the hand). The rules can and will vary with the Casino you are at or the people you are playing with. Always best to ask. According to Robert's Rules for Showdowns: Note that it doesn't say you can't fold, only that to win you must show. Also in #8 is an interesting sub-section: 8... A player may opt to throw his hand away after all the betting for the deal is over, rather than compete to win the pot. However, the
  other players do not lose the right to request the hand be shown if he
  does so."
What to do when a third suited card appears on the river,"It depends on your impressions of your opponent, if he's tight he wouldn't ever call your bets on the flop and turn with only a draw. In that case bet because he has something and he's willing to call with what he has and you have him beat. If he's a loose player then he could have the flush. If you check he'll bet on the river 9 times out of ten. You have to ask yourself what's the chance he's bluffing. Since you know he's loose then there's a good chance he's bluffing and you have to call. So bottom line, if your opponent is tight bet the river for value, if he's loose, check call."
"Add-on value and ""bubble factor""","I agree about your bubble math for sattelite and R/A tournaments. The general idea is that if you are on regular MTT bubble, in the money already, or even on the final table (doesn't metter) - you should tend to get the highest place. And take appropriate risk. I mean the distribution of prize places you get should be in favor of the first and last positions. Due to MTT prize structure it is much more profitable on the distance to get highest/lowest than middle/high-middle places."
Is it correct to go all-in when you have KK?,"Well, I'd have to say ""it depends"".  If you are going against AA then you are a 4 to 1 dog.  Not a good situation.  If you are playing against a super-rock (TAG) then it might be a fair bet that their super-aggressive play is advertising AA.  However, those players are fairly rare and the average TAG is capable of going over the top with AKs, in which case you are a major favorite (~2 to 1).  This is especially true, IME, in tournament play.  In fact, the only hand you fear is AA - at least heads-up pre-flop.  AA vs KK is pretty rare. If you have other players in the hand, you want to push them out, so going all in is a good strategy.  You don't want to go all in with KK (or even AA for that matter) against 2 or more players - ever - if you can help it.   You also should consider your own table image.  Have you been playing a bit loose, making it seem reasonable that another player could push you around with a marginal hand?  If so, then pound with KK - you're very likely the overwhelming favorite. So, unless you have a good analytic reason to believe that your opponent has AA, then go all in.  You'll very likely have the best of it.  But, if you find that you're just ""wondering"" if they have AA, then you're likely just playing scared.  Playing scared is infinitely worse then making an occasionally bad push against AA. Remember, poker is played over the long haul.  Just because your KK gets snapped off by an unexpected AA doesn't mean it's a bad play.  Just like your AA gets snapped by the frisky idiot playing J4os - that's just poker.  However, over time, getting your money in with the best of it more often than not will yield positive results.  It's a mathematical certainty.   Playing overly cautious poker - scared money - will always end badly."
How to deal with overcards in the flop,"One thing I've seen in tournament play is over betting prior to the flop with JJ-KK if you don't want to see them busted. I try not to do this myself unless I'm short stacked. It is common to see AA by the river since many players will call a typical bet or raise with A+anything.  If I have any pocket pair and see an overcard on the flop I'll typically bet into it for information, knowing that if I get raised or even called, I'm probably beat. But if I get called I get an almost free card for a long shot but possible set."
How can I keep my skills sharp without online real-money poker?,"Study. Find a poker training site that lets you download their videos, and get as many as you can find for your game. Then don't just watch them, but study them. At every point a decision is made, ask yourself if you would make the same decision or not. Take notes. If you continued your subscription with the training site beyond the initial month to do the massive downloading, then ask questions about the video. Go through old hand-histories with a fine-tooth comb. As poker players, we often neglect spending time to review in favor of getting in more hands. Now is the time to buck up and review the hell out of all the hands you've put in over the past few years. If you don't find several leaks that you could fix upon returning to the tables, then you're not looking hard enough."
What is an open limp?,"Open Limp: When the first player enters the pot by limping in. Explained When a player is first to enter the pot and simply limps they are making a call of the big blind. This is generally considered to be a weak-passive play typified by beginning poker players. Example The small blind is $5 and the big blind is $10 in a live poker game. The first two players fold. The next player then limps in and calls the big blind for $10. This is an example of an Open Limp. Source:
http://pokerterms.com/open-limp.html"
What happens if the card wasn't burned?,"If the card is known, you fix it if no action has taken place. If action has taken place, you continue the round using the card.  You might also consider just letting it lay and play always, because you can never be quite sure the dealer actually did not burn. Unless someone happened to see them not burn it is never really clear. Note if you're on the flop or turn, you still fix the deck by burning so that the sequence remains as shuffled. This is the way it is going to be ruled in most casinos by experienced floor people. You continue action if there has been any action, any action including just the first player checking, because any action has given players in later position information that may give them an unfair advantage because of the mistake of the dealer. So you play it out as though the card seen is the correct card. This is OK because even though the card is not the correct card it is still a random unknown card, meaning it does not affect any players statistically. Another answer said you shuffle the deck, that is wrong, you do not shuffle the deck. "
How should I play blind vs. blind late in tournaments against unknown players?,"Against an unknown opponent, stack sizes dominate the decision for me. If we have a big stack and he has an average-to-medium-but-not-short stack, then I'll raise a lot until he shuts me down. Similarly, if we both have medium stacks, I'll probably still raise a fair amount - if we cover him by a fair margin, this frequency goes up.  If either one of us has a short stack, I won't give him opportunities to resteal with marginal hands - I'll either tighten up or I'll commit enough chips that he knows I'm not going away (60%+ of his stack, or just shoving). Obviously, as our stack becomes low enough that we have to get desperate for chips, shoving becomes the most likely option. The other consideration I will make (and here it's primarily when we both have relatively comfortable stacks, with me not covering him by very much, if at all) is to establish a history. In these situations, I may fold a number of hands that I would otherwise play, just to make him recognize that I am not stealing from him very often (an image which I later use to my advantage when stealing becomes more important). Obviously, this requires having some sort of reason to think that our opponent is paying enough attention for this to matter."
How to play the flop when two aces appear?,"You did not play the pot correctly, you managed to lose the maximum amount possible. Your pre-flop raise was OK.  With queens I would much rather have two aces hit the board then one, but that only means my hand is a little less likely to be beat at this point because there is one less ace in someone's hand. It does not mean anything other then that, you still do not know in the early position that you were in, if someone has a hand. Which brings us to the follow up bet you made. The best way to figure out if the player has the ace, is if he calls a big follow up bet or not. You already know that since he is in the hand and has called a pre flop raise, that in his range of hands a ace is somewhat likely. The only hands that this player is not going to fold here are pocket pairs and hands that contain an ace. The player may fold some pocket pairs here. The flop is very dry, so there are no draws out there, the only sure thing you know before you make the follow up bet is that any of your opponents with an ace are going to make a call. Your follow up bet is usually a bad bet, and the times it is not are because nobody has flopped anything. Even if your hand was a winner on the flop, you would never loose as much checking this hand down on this very dry board as you did on this very dry board by betting half the pot. I would have checked this flop. I would have tended to fold if the player bet. The only time I would have called this players bet is when I had a good read on the player, especially against an unknown player. What were you thinking when the third ace hit the board? I suspect you though he could not possibly have the last ace in the deck and you put him on a pocket pair. Bad thinking because all the signs are that he had an ace, and just because the odds of him having an ace are way down, that has nothing to do with the fact that he has an ace. When your bet got called on the turn, you should have been finished with the hand. Your bet was horrible. Your call was even worse. You married your hand and ignored all the signs that you were in a terrible marriage. The way to play pocket queens when an ace hits the board, is to slow way down. There is very little upside to betting, you can only get called most of the time by a better hand. By checking if the opponent decides to be sneaky you may get free cards that win you the pot. (In this case you would not have unless you back door a straight.) With the exception of a pre flop raise, there is nothing you did right in this hand. Your Grade is D-."
How do you determine a good online table to sit at?,"Depending on the level of traffic and skill at the site/stakes you are playing, often the best way to find a good table is to seek out a table that gives you position on a player who you know how to beat. This can be due to that player being a fish, or simply due to some knowledge you have of their game. To supplement this, I would recommend keeping a list of players you want to target in this manner. Update the list whenever someone makes an impression on you as easily beatable, and migrate the players you see online to the top every time you play with them. If you can't find any of your ""list"" players, or the site that you are playing on does not support searching for players, then you can revert to other factors. What works best for you will be something to determine from your specific style/game. I typically play a tighter game, which means that I seek tables with a high VPIP, and a large average pot. Of the tables I find meeting these conditions, I will drill down further and look for the ones that give me position on a few players with full stacks, preferrably not regs."
How to identify low sets against top pair top kicker? (Online Poker),"Sometimes you realy can't avoid it 
It realy depends what type of game you are playing if it's super turbo or turbo where you are < 10 BB i guess shoving PF is the right play. If you have no information about your player and you have 20BB in a fast pace game i don't think you can avoid an all in either because of the 5-7BB PF raise. Tournament play and Cash games differ a bit 
I feel like a bet 5-7BB is bad in tournament but it feels ok in cash game. But in cash game it's alot easyer to avoid getting allin with top pair. I do fold more top pairs on cash game because i have the time to gather all information of the player before making tricky decisions. And in cash game its easyer since you normaly have a bigger stack like 200BB stack and can do things like check raise to test players and gather information. [Tournament]Try to be transparent
Try to be transparent so that when you have KK or 89 they can't know what hand you have. 
You basically tell him which hand you have by doing a 5-7BB raise PF. Hands he will expect from you AJ+ and TT+. If you think about it yourself, do you realy raise 5-7BB with JTs or stuff like 89 ? I don't think so, and even if you did than it's either early tournament or you should start changing up your betting pattern PF.  The fact that you raised 5-7BB i guess blinds where at 50/100 and you had something like 5k stack. At that point bad players tend to gamble alot because its early tournament and if there's a rebuy still going on they won't hesitate. At later blinds like 500/1k people have around 20k so they won't risk calling 5-7k to see if they hit trips, they would rather go for an all in or fold with low pairs.  [Tournament]Player tendency 
Players limping and calling those kinds of bets often have pairs or suited connectors. If you are playing Tournament and blinds climb up slowly(12min) you should be at 50BB stack and with that in mind you shouldn't try to risk your whole stack on a single play against someone you have no information at all(unless you feel like gambling). Analyze your opponent: 
Biggest mistake new players make is that they always focus on a single hand they played when they should focus on all the hands they played against their opponents. If you gather enough information about him you can read your opponent easly. Often it only needs one hand to know what kind of player he is.  Situations like going all in UTG with 20BB with something like A5 you would recognize that this player is realy bad and you could write some notes about it.
You should learn his betting pattern and if he often checks out of position when he has a hand or if he bets when he has a hand. Often bad players tend to do the same thing over and over so keep writing notes (i feel like writing notes more useful than HM and PT) and have your Holdem manager or Pokertracker tracking all that usefull information. You could check the time they take before betting you might get some tells out of some people. Every single piece of information is important so try to write them all down.  If you play 1 tournament at a time it might be boring but if you track all the information you won't have time to be bored and you will get further in a tournament and avoid some of those tricky spots."
Poker program that tells you the best-known multistrategy in limit hold'em,"I'm Mike Johanson, one of the authors on the recent ""HULHE is solved"" paper, and I wrote a fair chunk of the code for Cepheus. kuzzooroo's link was the right one.  At the link he gave (not reproduced here - new account, I have no reputation to post > 2 links), you can query any part of Cepheus' strategy, or play against it -- at least, you will be able to once the traffic lightens up, we've had to disable the play-Cepheus page for now.  But the query service is running fine. If you'd like to read the Science paper, you can find a link to it on my personal webpage.  My earlier papers there will also give more detail on the algorithm it's based on, called CFR. If you want the source code, that's available too - BSD license.  link As for other programs and groups, and the history of our effort...  The University of Alberta's Computer Poker Research Group started in 1994, and we've had a considerable focus on heads-up limit hold'em since 2001.  In 2003 we created the first decent game theoretic strategy for the game, called PsOpti (vlzvl mentioned Sparbot - it's the same strategy, renamed for Poker Academy).  In 2007 and 2008, our program Polaris competed against human pros, narrowly losing in 2007 and narrowly winning in 2008, marking the first time that a computer has ever defeated human poker pros in a meaningful match.  In 2011, we developed the first tractable algorithm for HULHE that lets us compute an optimal counter-strategy to defeat a given strategy, and measure how much that strategy loses for against the counter-strategy.  That lets us measure how close to unbeatable play we are.  Ever since, we've been driving closer and closer to perfect play (i.e., towards a worst-case loss of 0), and have been publishing our progress over the years in open, publicly accessible research papers. In this paper, after 13 years of focus on HULHE from our first decent game theoretic strategy to this one, we're announcing that we have finally essentially solved the game.  Cepheus is maximally beatable for under 0.000986 big blinds per game, or under 0.05 big bets / 100 if you prefer those units.  It'd take more than 60 million hands of using the perfect counter-strategy to have 95% confidence of winning against Cepheus, which is why we say it's essentially solved: it'd take more than a human lifetime of play to statistically discern the difference between Cepheus and an exact optimal strategy.  We go into much more detail on this in the paper. So as far as Jim Beam's statement that we're claiming credit for something others have already done...  I disagree.  We've been in this space for 20 years, were the first to achieve the earlier big milestones in HULHE (first not-terrible strat, first program to beat humans, first measurement of worst-case loss), and have pushed the science by fully publishing our work at every step of the way.  Essentially solving the game is the final step in a long line of research on this game. Not much is known about PokerSnowie and the casino game - they don't release stats on how close to optimal they are, or any useful details of what algorithms they use or how their programs work.  PokerSnowie claims to be close to equilibrium, but offer no proof at all, and from the discussions on 2+2 where they also claim to play optimal 6-player and no-limit, it's clear that they either don't know what ""game theoretic optimal"" play means, or they're exaggerating: no-limit is unfathomably larger than heads-up limit and it's nonsense to claim optimal play there, and an ""optimal"" strategy wouldn't have any theoretically useful properties in a 6-player game.  Actually, in the 2+2 threads, they've admitted to this and removed most of the advertising from their webpage that mentions ""optimal play"", and have refocussed their marketing. Cepheus is an essentially optimal strategy for heads-up limit hold'em, and it can play against either of them, or any human or other program, and be guaranteed to not lose.  We're @PolarisPoker on twitter - we mostly use that for posting links to new papers that we publish."
"What is the definition of a ""redraw""?","A redraw generally tends to mean that you have the best hand, and you have a draw to another better hand.  In Texas Hold 'Em, the best example would be a set on the flop.  If you get all-in against a flush draw, even though they have a draw to a better hand (a flush), you have a re-draw to a hand that can beat their draw (a full house).  The term is more useful in an Omaha type game, where 2 players can frequently hold the same hand (e.g. a nut straight), but one can have a redraw to a nut flush or full house."
What do you study for poker? What do you focus on?,"I'll give you my perspective as someone who has abandoned cash games in favor of only doing live MTTs.  I think a lot of this will depend on your current level of experience and your game will change over time. Of course, you need to be sound in things like picking your pre-flop hands, but these are some things that I know I need to work on for my tourneys: 1 - MTTs constantly have you playing with new people, new tables. When I sit down I try to pause and take stock - how many players? Who are the big stacks? Who are the small stacks? Where are they? Get a sense of where you're at in the lineup. 2 - On your way to the final table, you're going to play everything from full tables to short handed. Make sure that you are comfortable ""switching gears"" between both of those. For example, think about an MTT and there's only 12 of you left. That's two tables, six-handed that then becomes one final table, ten-handed. Can you make the right adjustments for a full table after playing six-handed for a few hours? That's not always an easy thing and I know it's tripped me up in some tourneys. 3 - Be quick on your preflop math. Most people make mistakes when it comes to antes. ALWAYS know how much is in the pot pre-flop. Know what an appropriate half-pot and pot size bet is to open. Don't sit there and watch the dealer shuffle, watch the tourney clock and figure out the ante, the blinds and know what that means for the pre-flop pot. Hope this helps."
Systematic all-in,"My short answer is this: as long as your opponents have 100BBs, it doesn't matter how many BBs you have (as long as you have them covered). You will only play for their 100 BBs. Shoving every hand when you have 10000 BBs is as bad as shoving every hand when you have 100 BBs. The difference is that in former case you don't have to re-buy every time after you lose."
"Strategy Against Aggressive, Maniacal Player","I think this is the wrong way to think about what happened: The situation you were in was a dream; a player willing to get it in while you held the better hand?  Again and again for lots of money?  I want that to happen as often as possible!  The fact that you can lose (and lose a lot) in these situations is something you need to accept as a poker player.  If you make the decision to tighten up and worry about the risk of losing, it makes you less money in the long run. The best strategy may be to continue doing what you were doing; getting it all in the middle with the better hand."
Is it against the rules to show a hole card during play?,"Many tournaments, such as the WSOP and WPT, will declare a hand dead if it is exposed.  In cash games or private games, it will depend on house rules, but it is generally allowed."
Hide high value chips,"Must be visible at all times, you can get a penalty for hiding them. You'll get a warning normally first but you will get a penalty if you keep hiding them in most places. In general I'll ask a player once to move their large chips out in front of their stack, after that I'll call floor if they don't. You as a player have the entitlement to know what size stack you're against, just as much as the other players have that same entitlement. Not exact size, but a solid estimate, i.e. if you're stack is 200,000 but someone counts 190,000 fine. But imagine you had say 8 or 10 25k chips behind that stack, that's not fair to the other player. By hiding your higher value chips you're potentially unfairly effecting someone's decision."
Moving from online to live games,"Funny you should ask that today, i was just reading the following article by PKR's newest pro: Live and Learn by Simon Hemsworth"
$1/$2 Live - Bottom set on flop and facing 3bet,"If you think you have the best hand then going all-in is about the only move that's left as a sensible option. That said, for us to be ahead, villain would have to have J7x, J8x, 87x (Two pairs); J9x, T8x, T9x, T7x (Pair+Gutshots); 96x, 65x (Open Ended Straight Draws); AJx (TPTK, although I doubt he'd be this aggressive?!). Otherwise, we're behind JJ, 88, T9x. If you perceive the villain to be loose and still very aggressive, then I'd move AI, with the assumption that he's playing a high percentage of the hands we beat this way. If he's slightly tighter now, as you say, then I think it's a much closer decision. Either way, the villain is repping that he has decent equity. Personally, as it is, it seem like a fold. If you're behind, which I think is very likely, then you have few redraws as they're compromised by his better sets."
"Is ""talking to influence action"" illegal at WSOP?","Yes talking to influence action is against the rules and people push it.  When he announced the pot size it went over the line. By announcing the pot size he was coaching. That is a rule violation. The dealer said cannot influence action.  Yes talking to influence action is done but it needs to be more subtle than that. From there his excessive chatter was taunting and intended to disrupt the player. It does not have to be rude. If he had said it once then OK.  He was was doing it to break her thought process and that is not part of poker.  Yes you can say stuff to try and tilt someone but not during play like that.  ""Man that is the third time in row you lost on the river"" after play is over is OK. "
"Defending a made hand, is it good to make a high bet?","What was your position ? Q♥6♥ is a hand I would've only played only for a steal (maybe) or in SB (also maybe). It's less than an average hand. The fact also you got 3 callers sounds like you were in a very loose table. I expect at least one out there to have a better Q than yours. CBet was reasonable, but the bet size was plain wrong in my opinion. A 3/4 pot would be better and enough. You're obviously kicking out hands like 44, 55, Ax or maybe 99 but hands like T9,QT are going to stay if players are loose, hands like AQ,KQ are going to call/raise and hands like Q8,87 will go for your stack. All reasonable hands that may have called you preflop. Always try to think before betting if that texture hits your opponent calling range. Now, you have 3 loose opponents, so it's much more feasible you're already beaten. A Cbet is certainly in order, but after that keep the pot small."
bluffing when somebody is all-in,"OK, let's break it down mathematically. I'm going to use a standard poker equity calculator for this. My equity calculator tells me that, at this point: Now, what happens when we add 2 more players in the hand, both with completely random hands (100 % range) ? (what their hands or ranges are is totally irrelevant to the point I'm trying to make, you'll see) The equities now transform into: What I want to focus on are only 2 things: the number of players and how the all-in player's equity changed a.k.a. IT WENT DOWN. The conclusion is that, the more players there are competing for a pot, the smaller the chances are that you'll win it 1. For this exact reason, a typical play when a player is all-in is for all the other players to check it down, so that there will be a significant higher chance that the all-in player gets eliminated. I do it all the time in tournaments and you should too (this type of play is typically done at tournaments only, not cash games). The only situation in which it makes sense to continue betting (and building a side pot) is when you have the nuts or something extremely strong (like Aces full, quads, straight flushes etc.). You want to do this in order to extract more value out of your hand. In this case, you can pretty much be sure that you have the best hand, since players will usually go all-in when they're short-stacked, which means that a marginal hand is ""good enough to shove"". Since you didn't check it down in that situation, my guess is that this is the reason why someone else at the table told you that you made a donky play. People should be nicer and restrain from this type of comments (keep it to themselves) but, in this case, I think that person had a point: it would've been optimal for you to check it down all the way. 1 = This is essentially and fundamentally exactly the same reason why it's best practice to raise preflop: more players will fold, which means you'll have fewer opponents and, generally, higher equity."
"In heads-up Texas hold'em, what starting hands are ""above average"" pre-flop?","Q7x or ""The Computer Hand"" is the median poker hand in Texas holdem. If you really want to analyse these things in more depth, I'd suggest getting Pokerstove. You can run all hand matchups with numerous competing opponents through the free software. "
"Player very low on chips, can't pay Ante+BB. What happens?","Yes, as I understand. Player 2 can either call the amount of the big blind or if they make a raise, they will have to raise to the smallest allowable amount. In this case that would be the twice the size of the big blind (4000)."
Folding AA after the flop?,"Sounds like you had an 18K stack preflop, or about 30bbs. The 3K raise is fairly standard, though you shouldn't only raise that size with hands like AA because perceptive opponents can figure that sort of thing out if they play enough hands with you (then again, if no one at your table is perceptive, go ahead and play in an exploitable way).  On the flop the pot is about 6900 so your 3K is a tad too small. I'd go for at least 4200 or so. And you should never fold after making that bet, you simply aren't deep enough, he'll value shove lots of worse hands, and he can easily have draws (or potentially air) as well. So yeah, you've got to call here with these stack sizes. P.S. Don't post results, or at least don't post them this early. They'll have an influence on the responses you receive and you don't want that."
How do you play AQ or AK (off or suited) on $1/$2 Live?,"Generally in these sorts of spots you want to be betting for value because $1/$2 live players will call with all sorts of worse Ax hands and draws.  This turn card isn't great for us because AJ is now ahead and AT picked up some equity vs us. But still, she bought in for only 50bbs so without better reads that she could be a tight player I would just bet/call on the turn here and jam safe rivers if she calls a turn bet. Even when we're behind we have a gutshot - we're just not deep enough to fold this hand in this spot imo.  Also, the fact that she folded her first 5 hands is fairly meaningless. It is very easy to get 10-20 unplayable hands in a row, even for a loose player at FR."
What are the most important elements of poker to model in a Monte Carlo simulation?,"Assuming the purpose of the simulation is to determine a useful ordering of hands, the first thing to know is that there is no one true ordering, due to the non-transitivity of hand strengths.  So, all orderings are approximations. This subject has been tackled by many authors in print.  A notably useful approach is in Kill Everyone by Nelson, Streib, and Lee; the authors provide distinct rankings for raising all-in versus calling all-in. With betting simulated to find best ""playable"" hands when not expecting to be all-in preflop, this blog post is by far the best approach I've seen to the problem: http://pokercoder.blogspot.com/2006/07/towards-meaningful-ordering-of-hands.html http://pokercoder.blogspot.com/2006/07/downloadable-hand-orderings.html"
Can you call when the pot odds don't favour you?,"Yes, you can and you should. The concept you're describing is called implied odds (the estimated profit you'll make if you make your hand). Notice is a much less concrete value as it is an estimation of whether your opponent will call when the draw comes and the amount he'll be willing to pay. There's also the concept of reverse implied odds which are the odds or you completing your draw and still loosing (for example against a bigger draw or a full house)"
AKo all in v 57o?,"TL;DR:
No, he should have folded.  :-) Longer explanation:
So there are 3,000 (SB) + 6,000 (BB) + 12,000 (2 callers) + 30,000 (bounty chips) + 36,000 (your stack) chips in the pot.  That works out to 87,000 chips.  It is 36,000 chips for him to call (unless he was one of the original callers) which is 2.41:1 (or 41% of the pot).  This basically gives him a negative value of about 4%, or 1,440 (of the 36,000 chips that he is risking) that he will lose, on average, with this particular hand match up. Since you have 6 big blinds, you should be going all in with more hands than just AK so the caller should put you on a range of hands that varies based on his experience and his view of the tournament/you.  Since most of those hands will be pairs bigger than his cards or two overs (especially since you are a tight player), his odds won't really be any better than that ever, and sometimes much worse (your pairs). If he knew that you had AKo, this is a marginal fold, which he could have gotten wrong ""in the heat of battle"" with all of the chips flying around, or maybe he just felt like gambling.  However, because you could have also had pairs, this should have been a clear fold and was probably just a player who didn't make a very good decision, for whatever reason (he isn't very good, he needed to leave to meet his girlfriend and was just trying to finish the tournament, etc.)."
What do you do when you are running bad,"Oftentimes, the reason bad luck leads to bad play is because of a pyschological need to get back to even faster than you should statistically be able to. If you normally win on average $10/hour, and you just had a 3 day losing streak where you lost $1000, you may not have the patience to play 100 hours to win back that $1000. Subconsciously you will involuntarily try to get it back faster, and that means you may find yourself entering pots you normally wouldn't because they are abnormally large, or limping with far too many hands, or calling low EV bets hoping for a lucky card... I.E, you will play worse trying to race against time. As Jeffrey Blake stated, one way to fix this is to simply stop playing long enough for the desire to get even to wear off. For me, after really big loses, regardless of the reason, I found that two weeks was about right for me to stop caring about the big loss. Another thing that helps is to drop down to much lower stakes than you usually play. The stakes have to be low enough that there is no possible way you can make back your recent losses. This has a similar effect to not playing at all because once your mind has accepted the fact that you can't get even at these stakes, it won't trick you into making the mistakes I mentioned above, and you can get back to focusing on odds, EV, and reading people."
Is trash talking legal in WSOP?,"As This article explains -and I remember watching Negreanu complaining about it on the feature table of 2011 WSOP Main Event- there is a rule that almost forbids all talking on the table. ""41. No Disclosure
Players are obligated to protect the other players in the tournament at all times. Therefore, players, whether in the hand or not, may not: The one-player-to-a-hand rule will be enforced."" Specially number two leaves trash talking out. The article points out it's a seven years old rule, but it has been really enforced on last year WSOP. It's my understanding that on this year WSOP (2012) that enforcement has been relaxed a little, I think it's OK to talk when only two players are in the hand. Also you can check a Daniel Negreanu blog post about that rule."
Raising after an all in,No. It is too small of a raise. Since the original raise was a raise of 1200 (1600-400=1200) the raise by the big blind would have to be at least an additional 1200 (i.e. 2800 total) to re-open the action to the original raiser. 
"Why do people make the following call, check, call round the table?","If they are beginners, their play is completely haotic and makes absolutely no sense. In a weird and ironic way, this makes such players somewhat dangerous... I see this all the time if I play online and enter a tournament that has virtual money as entry fee (yeah, I still do that). In such tournaments, people often go all-in in the absolute first hand with garbage hands (T 4, 8 6 etc.). This is how absolute beginners play. Because basically they have nothing to lose. I believe your case is the same situation. If you raise to 1K preflop (which is 1K / 200 = 5 BBs) and everyone calls, this is not such an unusual situation. But the call by everyone on the turn is super weird and makes no sense. You didn't play your hand badly. I don't know if it's very good because: What I like to do when I deal with such opponents is:"
What mnemonic rules are helpful in poker calculations?,"There are thumb rules for the preflop equity (against a single random opponent) of pocket pairs and suited-connected combos. For the equity of a pocket pair, you calculate how many cards away from 2 your cards are (for example, Queens are 10 cards away from 2), multiply by 3 and add 50%. So QQ's preflop equity is approximately: (10 * 3) + 50 = 80% For suited-connected combos (JTs, for example) the same rule applies; You calculate how many cards away from two the highest card is (Jack is 9 cards away from 2) and add 30%. So JTs preflop equity is approximately: (9 * 3)  + 30 = 57% PokerGym -- Preflop Hand Equity Values"
What's the order for showdown?,"The rules vary from casino to casino. But Generally:
The last person to bet has to show first and then it goes clockwise from him or her. You are allowed to muck if someone shows a winning hand.  However, a lot of casinos will show your mucked cards if the other player asks to see them after all the action is done.  When I say mucked cards I mean cards thrown in.  If the cards hit the muck they are usually gone for good at most places.  Asking to see someone's mucked hand is considered rude and should only be used if you suspect collusion. You usually have to show two cards to win.  Even if the other person mucks.  However, if the last better mucks and it's just you left in the hand you can muck as well and still rake in the pot. There is no ""official rule book of poker"".  Each casino has their own book that they either made themselves or borrowed from another venue."
The right bluff frequency,"The correct bluffing frequency is a subjective measure. It all depends on the perceived probability that your opponent will call your bluff, and the estimated equity you have at that moment, whichever street you're on. Similar to the question How Do I Calculate EV Of Shoving..., you can work out how often bluffing would be a profitable play by manipulating the times you think your opponent would fold. Of course, you're bluffing so you'd prefer them not to call or raise! Jeffrey Blakes answer here gives a detailed breakdown of the equation to do this, using mathematical formula. My answer here uses the same process but I decided to take a semantic look, and put it into plainer language. In each instance, you are looking to manipulate the first section of each formula. The part where your opponent folds. This has a subsequent effect on how often you assume your opponent will call, described in the latter part of the formula."
"Why is comparing hands based on how often they win a showdown or on their poker ""hand rank"" worse than worthless?","It does have some value (I feel as though the author's statement is a bit hyperbolic though he is trying to emphasize his point) but the types of hands that can be made postflop with your hole cards are more important because the pot grows exponentially with every street. Also note how the author starts the sentence with ""deep stack."" The deeper your stacks the more important this concept becomes since you'll generally need stronger hands to be willing to stack off. But yes, hand rank does still have some value. The problem is that newer players see big pairs and never even fold them postflop unimproved with deep stacks when they definitely should be. "
NL200: Difficult River Situation; Whether To Bluff Or Not?,"Bluffing the river after checking back turn here is not a good idea. The only hand you are representing when betting the flop, checking back the turn here is like AQ or JJ. You will get too many curious calls to be able to successfully bet the river here. 
If you want him to fold low pairs etc., you will need to barrel the turn and possibly the river as well.  When villain calls this flop his range consists of hands like QJ,JT,T9,KJ,KQ and alot of other low-medium pairs. I would not put him on a particularily strong range since I think an aggressive player like that will most likely 3b these hands preflop. I would prefer you to check back the flop here to keep the pot small and try to get the cheapest showdown as possible."
"In deep stacked NLHE cash games, in what way do the implied odds of my starting hands change vs shallow stacked games? And why?","Generally, as stacks get shallower, cards matter more.  As stacks get deeper, game dynamics and player tendencies matter more. When playing with short effective stacks (<50bb), you need to play hands that will make the best hand a lot of the time.  If you are playing against people with larger stacks, you will have less fold equity, so you will not be able to rely on fold equity to make hands like suited connectors profitable.  A decent, strong starting range would be something like {88+, AT+, KJ+, QJ+}.  This is 11.6% of hands, and it is fairly tight.  You can widen your range if you go to more of a shove/fold short stack strategy, relying on fold equity to increase your edge, but against a fairly loose range that you might see in a weaker live game {22+,A2s+,K6s+,Q8s+,J8s+,T8s+,97s+,86s+,75s+,64s+,53s+,43s,32s,A8o+,K9o+,QTo+,JTo} (all pairs, suited aces, most suited kings, some suited queens and jacks, suited connectors and 1 gappers, broadway hands), this range has 58% equity. Moving into a more mid-stacked range, ""traditional"" poker ranges and thoughts apply - you will tend to get implied odds to set-mine and play speculative hands like suited connectors.  You will be able to get paid by weaker hands when you hit the bottom end of a straight or a low flush, two pair can pay off your set, and a flush might call the occasional paired board. As stacks get deeper, lower speculative hands begin to drop in value.  A set of 2s becomes less valuable - you will still make some money, but you will not get a 200+bb stack from 2 pair, or AA.  Likewise, when you hit your flush with a low suited connector like 54s, and stacks go in, you are much more likely to be against a higher flush.  So, in general, you can play a fairly wide range of hands when deep stacked, but you need to be able to get away from non-nut hands.  Axs and Kxs have much more value than lower suited connectors.  High pocket pairs have much more value than low pocket pairs.  High connectors have mcuh more value than low connectors.  Hands that are coolers with 100bb stacks are disasters with 300bb stacks.  This is the concept of reverse implied odds. This dynamic also allows tremendous opportunities for varied play when deep.  There is a lot more room to create fold equity when deeper, and there is also a lot more room to bet/fold when deep.  When 2 players with 100bb stacks each get 100bb in by the flop, everyone is all-in, and no more mistakes can be made.  When each player is 300bb deep, and they each get 100bb in by the flop, there are still 2 streets of big decisions left.  The dynamics of a match, and quick adjustment, become much more important with deeper stacks."
Why is Royal Flush listed separately from Straight Flush?,"I don't believe it has any historical background other than this is how the rules go. A royal flush is the highest hand possible and is given a unique name as something to achieve. I got a royal flush sounds a lot cooler than, I got an ace-high straight flush.  It feels more prestigious. I also don't find it confusing, and if it is, it's a quick explanation to set the person on track."
How can I use a player's decision to check blindly on the flop as a tell?,"Checking in the dark is a high level play to reestablish position on the flop.  Like someone else already mentioned, most of the time this is done with drawing hands, as someone with vulnerable hands like AA/KK would most likely never make this move.  It is essentially a way of giving away less information regarding your hand and how it relates to the flop.   You reestablish position by making your opponent the ""first to act"" on the flop bet.  The blind check gives no information regarding the strength of your hand in relation to the flop, so therefore hands that have more value the further they are disguised (like drawing hands), are protected more by checking blind.  AK can be seen as a drawing hand and if you check dark and hit an A or K, the strength of your hand is disguised more and allows you an opportunity to earn more for making your hand.   Agreed that this play should only be used by people who have a strong grasp of the game and/or their table.  A beginner who tries this play won't be able to leverage its power as much.  The good thing that if you play against someone who uses this is that you will always have the option of seeing the turn card for free, should you wish."
Joining an offline poker league - can being new be used to my advantage?,"My opinion is not to bother too much in the beginning. Just play your style and observe others' style of play. Joining a small league has the advantage that you can learn fast about your opponents, but the disadvantage that they too have the opportunity to learn about you just as fast. In conclusion, in the beginning you might have some good short term results, because they don't know you, but the results will tend to even out, looking more or less like a Nash equilibrium. I don't know how good the other players are so I cannot make any assumptions about them. So, until proven contrary, don't try to level yourself. In the end, skill level and cards beat any exploitive tactics. Good luck!"
"Are Poker books like ""Book on Tournament Texas Hold'em"" trust worthy?","Firstly, I'm pretty sure that was my first poker book, and I think its definitely worth reading. Here's a summary of my answer: I think what is interesting here is how the answer to this question draws a lot from the format of StackExchange itself, and why it works so well. The first question, is akin to asking Is the author (Dan Harrington) trustworthy? It's highly subjective, much like the game itself, and aside from the objective math, its predominantly about logical reasoning in the material and judgement of the authors character. There are a few other relevant factors (discussed later), but I believe these two are the most important. By itself, the information in the book, as with most books, is part conceptual and part mathematical, both implicit and explicit. Maths is fair and provable. Concepts are often, but not always, subjective and open to discussion. There can certainly be a great deal of logic involved in theoretical explanations, so many examples are shown to have sound reasoning. The examples that don't are quickly recognized and given less importance. my advice would be, when reading, be aware of the type of material you're currently reading. Aside from the logic of the material, the author is worthy of scrutiny. When an author publishes anything, you only need to look at what they stand to lose to understand the importance of being genuine. Dan Harrington, at the time of writing this book was at the forefront of publishing in the poker arena. Add to that his endorsements,  and that he drew his living from the game itself, gives us as readers some confidence in his expertise. If the author were unknown, had no obvious vested interest in the game, then skepticism would naturally increase about the validity of the advice, and rightly so. This is also the reason I appreciate Poker.Stackexchange. More signal, less noise, and a measure of reputation. Poker books are an unusual mix of fact and fiction, the balance of which affects our trust. Trusting the facts of the maths presented by successful people, and believing in their representation of the fictional situations they use as examples, are compelling to those learning the game. It's like being shown the inner workings of magic. These situations are stories. As players, we're story-tellers at heart. Poker techniques are like stories which are creatively brought to life by a good narrator, but if the author breaks the fabric of the underlying narrative then trust is lost and the validity along with it. This fragile mix of fiction and non-fiction, should increase our confidence in the material. Any unbalanced skew of the material toward too fictional a narrative, quickly sees the book assigned to the bargain bucket of bookstores. Discount bins are natures literary filter.
I could probably go on, but i'll just summarize a few extra things worthy of mention. Some factors to consider when considering trustworthiness of poker material: The reproducibility of results. A necessity in scientific validation. If the advice doesn't produce the aforementioned effects, the methods are quickly discarded as incredulous. Much the same for poker techniques. It's trial and error methodology, but it does mean that bad advice isn't used for long. The possibility of mistakes as opposed to fraud. Maybe in practice the ideas will work for the author, but not for you. This seems to relate to a few logical fallacies, one being ""False Dilemma"" where the fallacy can occur by accidental omission of extra situational aspects and not by deliberately omitting them. Does the author know what is inessential? If the material equates to the science of poker writing, editing is the art of poker writing. The author's points may be valid, but if they're not in context they can be misleading. Lots to think about! :)"
What tournament size is best to play if completely new to on-line playing Texas hold-em?,"I advocate starting off with the ""smaller tournament"" approach to start learning. Most of the money that you make in large-field tournaments will come from the few times you end up placing high at the final table. There is a huge difference in money between going out first at the final table and placing in the top 3. Thus I recommend first developing the skills to ensure that when you get deep into a tournament, you can maximize your chance of winning. Play at a final table is well-mirrored by play in a single-table tournament (often referred to as a sit-and-go or SNG). Use them as a training ground to master the relevant concepts. Without that mastery, you will be unlikely to master final-table and short-handed situations anywhere near as quickly as SNGs enable, which will slow your growth and may well reduce your overall winning potential."
How does a wild card (53rd) affect the odds of making the standard poker hands?,"I'm no mathematician, but I think the joker switches the rankings of full houses and flushes. With 53 cards, you have c(53,5) or 2,869,685 possible poker hands. I'm using this site http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hands as a reference for normal deck hand numbers. 5 of a kind This has to be exactly 4 cards of the same rank plus the joker. So that means there are exactly 13 five of a kind hands. 13/2,869,685 = % 0.000502 Straight flush You would have all of the normal sized deck straight flushes, 40, plus all of those with one card replaced by the joker, 40 * c(5,1) = 200. 240/2,869,685 = % 0.000923 4 of a kind For this one you use all the regular deck four of a kinds, 624, plus all the joker four of a kinds. One card is the joker then three of a kind, 13 * c(4,3), then the 5th card can't match the three of a kind so there are 53 - 5 = 48 cards left. 624 + 13*c(4,3)*48 = 3120/2,869,685 = % 0.12  Full house Normal deck full houses, 3744, plus jokered full houses, c(4,2)*c(4,2)*13*12. 3744 + c(4,2)*c(4,2)*13*12 = 9360/2,869,685 = % 0.36 Flush Normal deck 5 to a flush, c(13,5)*4, plus four to a flush c(13,4)*4, minus all straight flushes. c(13,5)*4 + c(13,4)*4 - 240 = 7768/2,869,685 = % 0.29 Straight A normal sized deck has 10,200 straights so that will still be more common than flushes and full houses."
Who has advantage if one player is known to have an Ace?,"For the purposes of this answer, Player 1 is the one with the Ax hand. Player 2 is the player with the non-Ace hand. I'm also assuming that Player 2 has a random hand - in other words, sometimes their starting hand will also include an Ace.  This is an interesting question. My conclusion is that Player 2, knowing that Player 1 has an Ace, has the advantage, but it won't be easy to win! Furthermore, the advantage comes from the one card knowledge, as opposed to something else like position. If Player 2 knows the opponent has an Ace, then it would be imperative to narrow down their range drastically and only play things like Broadway cards with an Ace in the hand. Anything else and they are taking too many risks.  However, Player 2 narrowing down the range in this manner gives Player 1 a lot of information too! Player 2 needs to avoid a scenario where Player 1 always knows that they are on an Ace. So Player 2 would have to do some range balancing in order to throw Player 1 off their cards.  And that's really where the advantage comes in - Player 2 can balance their range. But Player 1, with the Ace, is basically ""locked-in"" to their range! This is the angle that needs to be exploited in order for Player 2 to win. So, it's not easy, but in order to win, Player 2 would need to be willing to showdown relatively frequently with trashy hands and be prepared to lose with some of those hands. They would need to keep a tight range that keeps all the Broadways with an Ace and occasionally also show down with J2o and T4s  Player 2 would also consider playing other things that flop well and completely miss the range for Player 1. For example something like 8♥ 9♥ wouldn't be a terrible hand if the flop gives Player 2 multiple draws and/or a pair. If you can get to a board like that, then the hands are worthwhile to consider. Depending on skill, Player 2 can also bluff at a lot of boards. The board texture is going to be either very good or very scary for Player 1. So, as stated above, a board with good draws, that miss the Ax range, are good to make a move at and represent those hands. All your low straights and majority of flushes have the potential to be hands where Player 2 can push Player 1 off their Ace. So Player 2 could consider playing all monochrome boards and connected boards that provide multiple straight possibilities. Again, Player 1 is somewhat locked-in to the range (albeit a high one!) but that means that the low stuff is going to miss them too! That's the part that Player 2 can exploit and potentially win over the long run.  Having said all that, in the process of writing all this, I've also come up with countermoves for Player 1. Basically, they would need to play very aggressive pre-flop. You would need to make it very, very expensive for Player 2 to enter the pot. You need to avoid those board textures that give a lot of draws; best way to do that is raise, raise, raise pre-flop! Player 1 would NEVER just check or call pre-flop. In this process, they would win by blinding-off their opponent and giving Player 2 no cheap flops. The Ace is most valuable pre-flop. After that, the equity is more likely to drop than anything else."
What is the best strategy once you are chip leader in a tournament?,"Like many answers in poker, it depends. If the table you are at is wild and crazy, you can tighten up, back off and let them all duke it out. Don't sit back too long though or the luckiest of the crazies will soon be the chip leader. If the table is playing tight at this point, steal more blinds than normal. But perhaps one good strategy is, don't get into it with anyone that has more than half of your chip count, unless you're pretty sure you're going to win it. (Only applies to no-limit.)"
Do previous bets count towards All-In raises?,"Firstly, the term ""short stack"" only really relates to a pre-flop description of relative stack sizes of all players. It doesn't have a reasonable use after the action has started. That said, a player may be ""short stacked"" post-flop but that's entirely down to what action has occurred. Specific to the example, player A can only call the All-In for $7, although his total amount staked is $10, equaling that of player B. Opposing players still to act can only call the difference between their current staked amount and what opponents have bet, assuming they are closing the action. Otherwise, they can bet/raise up to their total stack assuming another player still to act can match it. You mention ""before betting"" and ""after betting"" and i'm not certain of what you mean, but it seems irrelevant as the game is sequential. Further action only exists after any action state. The term short stack is only a description and has no real use in game mechanics. As for the side pot issue, player A is involved in ALL pots as his bet covers everyone. That said, in your example: In a little more detail, player C can only win a multiple of his total staked amount ($9), thus the $27 main pot, or 3 players in that pot for $9 each. Players A & B can win the main pot and the side pot, where the side pot consists of the extra money staked above what the lowest amount staked was (i.e. above $9). Player A only has to match this extra amount of $1 (i.e. difference between what player B & C staked), thus 2 players in the side pot totaling $2. After all bets are matched, player A still has $1 behind which is not in play (i.e cannot be lost or won with), and players B & C are All-In."
Raising and multiple All-Ins,"Common rules: The initial bet was the $20 big blind. John's $35 all-in does not constitute a raise, and so does not affect the action. Pete's $45 all-in is the first raise. The next raise would have to be $70. There are a few places I've been with a house rule that an all-in of more than half the proper amount does constitute a raise, and so in one of those places the $35 would be the first raise, the the $45 would not be, making the next legal raise $55 ($35 + minimum $20). This is NOT the standard rule, and such places should be encouraged to change."

How do international poker players take tournament prize money home?,"All of the below is just my own personal opinion and not to be taken as legal or financial advice. When you win, there are two concerns for the casino to release your money. First is taxes and the second is getting the money to you. The money part is easy, they will basically give it to you however you want. You can take a check, chips, cash, a wire transfer, a combination of all of those, etc. But before any of that happens, they want to work out the taxes. Basically, they want to make sure that there is a federal number assigned to you so that they can tell the IRS (the US tax agency) that they paid X money to you and that they either collected the tax or they need to go to you to collect the tax. In the case of US residents, we have a Social Security Number (SSN) and once you give that to the casino they release your money. As for people who do not have a SSN, you can get what is known as an ITIN and that will serve as a valid number that you can give to the casino. An ITIN is also issued by the IRS and you can get one online in just a few minutes. Of course, all of the above is just my own personal opinion and not to be taken as legal or financial advice."
Adjustments to the rake?,"You want to maximize your EV whenever you can. There are really rare occasions for breaking this rule and take rake or other aspects (time, your extimated EV, length of game) into consideration. These considerations can increase your hourly but usually don't increase your bb/hand stat. For example : When I play HU SNG versus regular and I know I have small or no edge, I can go for 52/48 flip( == loosing in long run due to rake!) because after that hand, I can register for another HU with much greater ROI, therefore I sacrifice some of my edge for chance to play noob for bigger edge and invest my time to play game with bigger ROI. I want to stress that you are propably focusing on aspect, that will affect your play very rarely and not very much. Better grind and grind and get to higher stakes. GL at tables!"
Revealing a Friend's Tells,"If you want to see him become a better poker player, tell him.  If not, keep it to yourself."
Should I have went all-in with KK on this flop?,"My standard raise in this spot preflop would be something like $84. With reads that villains are bad (i.e. will call 3bets like this way too often) that number becomes bigger. So $110 probably isn't a bad raise size, but you should realize that you're putting in 1/3 of effective stacks and you really don't want to play postflop when that's the case.  Under the assumption that villain is fishy/not thinking too deeply I would check/decide on this flop. I would be sort of stubborn/hard pressed to fold given how much we put in but with some more reads on the opponent it could certainly be best. Shoving doesn't do us any good because when he has better he's not folding and when he has worse it's pretty tough for him to call. Also, if you think he has JJ-KK, why would shoving accomplish anything good for you? He probably won't call a shove with QQ, he'll instacall with JJ, and there's only one combo of KK so that's pretty much irrelevant. Plus AA, TT, AK, and some other hands certainly aren't out of the realm of possibility."
"Straight + Flush draw on flop, is all-in worth to play?","Shoving with a straight+flush draw is a pretty standard play for NLHE in my book. You typically have enough equity to be even money against your opponent's calling range. That means you could call their shove and see a profit due to the dead money in the pot. Almost any time that you could call and be even money, a shove is better, and the more money in the pot at the time of your shove, the better it is. You profit from every time your opponent folds in these spots - much more than you do if you both stay in the hand."
Dealing with final table shovers,On the final table short stacks will always shove looking for that double up they need. I tend to call if i have any pocket pair and big hands like AK - A10. Anything that might flop well basically. If the same person keeps shoving i might loosen up. If they aren't doing it everytime then i will try and decide if its worth making the call or not. So to answer your questions: Call with any pair or big hand that will flop well. Including suited connectors (If they are shoving a lot) Only call with good hands and leave someone else to take them out.
Should I call all-in here with bottom set?,"I think all-in is definitely the best move here in a cash game, where the hero is most surely ahead. The villain, being in dealer position, would most likely have raised with QQ or 99 pre-flop.  Without knowing about your table image, the villain could have been playing Q-x, 10dJd, or could have 2 pair.   So of the likely holdings for the villian there are far more possible hand combinations that leave the hero ahead.  In addition, the hands in which the villain is ahead don't suit the betting pattern pre-flop. Now the holding that gives the villain the most number of outs is 10dJd.  Even with this holding, the hero has a 60% chance of winning according to PokerStove Calculator (this is because you also have outs, if the board pairs, or if a 2 comes up.) Therefore in a cash game, the worst scenario is he has 10dJd, but you are still ahead, so you should definitely call.   If you are short stacked in a tournament, again you should definitely call.  You have to be prepared to take more risks if you are short stacked, because you will get less of these opportunities. Further Mathematical Analysis of the Situation: In the table below, I have a table of the hands that a villain would reasonably bet all-in on.  The ""raw probability"" column gives the chance of a villain being dealt these hands given the card information we have. (i.e. hero's hand and the flop.) The ""relative probability"" column, gives the probability the villain is dealt the corresponding hand, given that he is dealt one of the combinations listed (Raw prob/total). Finally ""Winning Prob"" column tells us the probability the hero's hand will beat the corresponding hand given the flop.  The chance of winning can be determined by multiplying ""relative probability"" by ""winning probability"" for each card and adding together.  The end result is approximately 62% in favor of the hero. Expected Value  61.6744186       This analysis doesn't however take into account the chance that villain's probability of QQ and 99 should be lower than that in the table, due to no pre-flop raise.  It also excludes the fact that there is a lower probability of the villain going all in on straight-flush (54% based on 15 outs) than on a made hand such as 2 pair.  Both of these considerations mean there should be an even greater chance than 61% for the Hero.    "
At what point does poor etiquette turn into cheating?,"In the case of an inexperienced player, I would give a longer adjustment period. I might start instituting more severe repercussions on the fourth instance. This player sounds like he knows what he is doing (based in part on the ""the casinos let me do it"" comment), and as such, I'm going to be less forgiving. I would likely implement said 'severe repercussions' at the point that any of his offenses were repeated, and by the fourth time any individual offense occurred, I would be asking him to leave and not return. Frankly, it's a home game. If his behavior is making the experience unpleasant then you have every right to kick him out (I'm assuming that you aren't winning enough off of him to justify putting up with his crap; if you are, then consider it a cost of doing business). For tournaments, I do not believe he is even warranted a refund of his buyin, though in cash games he should be given fair value on his chips."
How do you play at a table where everybody always goes all in?,"Short answer: Play only premium hands (QQ+, AK). Longer answer: 
The more hands the average player on a table plays, the less hands you should play (except you play way better than your opponents and can even outplay them with worse hands). You can widen your calling range depending on your willingness to take risks. For example you can also call with hands like AT+ or KQ, since those hands are favorite against the wide ranges of you opponents, so you will make money in the long run. But widening your calling-range also leads to higher variance, since you will lose all ins more frequently. It also depends on certain other facts, such as If you have 40 bigs or more, you should be comfortable with waiting for strong hands and hope that they hold. But don't freak out if they crack your aces with J4o after a long wait, this happens from time to time ;) you'll make the money in the longrun. Good luck"
Possible cheating in Online Poker (by the dealer),"Well, I have two answers: 1) If you play as many hands of live poker as online poker, you will see the same thing.  While it is amazingly hard to believe hands sometimes, sooner or later every hand combination imaginable (and some that aren't) will happen on their own.  This is just part of a random system like poker.  Keep in mind that the most extraordinary hands are the ones that we remember too.  When AK beats KJ on a KQ942 board, we really don't think too much about it, but when 99 beats KK and AA on a AK992 board, we remember it and tell everybody!  2) The poker sites don't need to set hands up.  There is plenty of action as it is, and the consequences of getting caught are enormous.  There are people who do nothing but collect hand histories, and after getting a hundred million hands or so, you can see patterns and determine whether or not the hands are being tampered with.  If they are and people see it, your entire business goes poof and nobody is making money anymore.  Why would they risk that when they can just keep on making money (hand over fist) the legit way?"
What software to use when playing online?,"I'm pretty much quoting my answer to a very similar question: There are two major players in this field: Hold'em Manager and Poker Tracker. Both provide the type of in-depth number crunching and statistical analysis/display that you're looking for. They track things that few players would even think to look at without first seeing the information available in one of these two programs. In my experience, Hold'em Manager has a wider array of options for cash games, giving it a slight edge there. They even have some plugins that can detect strange patterns in your opponent's play and automatically issue notes about those plays. However, something about the way Hold'em Manager imports tournament results is messed up, so that gives Poker Tracker the edge for tournaments."
"Can ""run it twice"" be a +EV in a long run?",Running it multiple times does not move EV an inch.  It only reduces the variance. I think the example from kiota is spot on (+1).  On the river the number of down cards is 44.  Even after you see 2 cards the bet was placed before.   If you hit on the first then you are less likely to hit on the second. If you miss the first you are more likely to hit on the second. Think about it this way.  The last 2 card in the deck should have an equal chance of improving your hand as the first 2 cards. Heads up the most you can run is 22 times.  Math on 1 card left run it twice   if k = 2 it gets more complex and not going to try and prove that  
Can a dealer help and tell players their outs,"In this specific case, my opinion is that the dealer didn't do anything wrong. Especially because there was no more action, but also because he was just trying to be helpful to the new player. The rules for dealers are enforced by the floor, and if the player really had a problem with the dealer, calling the floor over would be the best course of action. Dealers normally do not break rules, especially if they can change the outcome of a hand because they will have to deal with the consequences (firing or other punishment).  The player causing the dispute could have been trying to get a cheap way to guarantee himself/herself the pot, but in general it seems odd to me that a player would have an issue with that."
Short stack play - best way to deal with it?,"You have an interesting point of view about the short stacks, but this point tells me that you lack a few key things about short stack play. As you might know, in cash games, the blinds never increase. As you might know as well, in cash games you can buy in for any amount which is between two fixed amounts, set by the casino. However, in cash games the pots grow almost geometrically, so it's not very hard to go all-in by the river, if you really want it to. As an example, if you raise preflop to 3 BBs, you get a caller and on each street you bet the pot, after the river betting occurs, you would have invested 107 BBs from your stack into the pot. The implications of what I said earlier are these: if you have a short stack (40 BBs), then, because the pot grows geometrically, it will be very easy to go all in. In the worse case you'll go all-in on the turn, because you have little money to play. This means that you are forced to play big hands, because you need to win now. There is even a known, mechanical strategy, called short stack strategy, designed to play if you have little money behind. Although it's mechanical and you cannot make big mistakes, it's not a huge money maker. The difference between high and low cards, difference known as the gap principle is huge. If you play speculative hands, you will not win enough to compensate for the frequent losses due to the fact that you missed. If you buy full stack (100 BBs), you'll have more money to play, it will be harder to go all-in, so you don't need all the time to have big cards. You can also play speculative hands that can form a monster hand and win the opponent's entire stack. Here, you can risk 3 BBs here, 3 BBs there because, in the most cases you'll miss, you would have risked 3% of your stack. The gap between high and low cards is lower than in the short stack scenario. If you hit and stack off your 100BBs opponents, it's more than enough to show a profit. If you buy deep stack (100+ BBs), then the game is much more skewed towards speculative hand play. The gap here is so low, that you will almost never see AA or KK going all-in post flop, unimproved. Because you have so much money behind, on the long term it pays off waiting for a big hand (full house or quads) and shipping the money into the middle. As the stacks increase, you need to me more skilled at play to be profitable in the long run. Anybody can shove KK being short stacked, but not anybody can maneuver his 250 BBs opponent into shoving his full house into the hero's quads. Let's compare this with your question. Short stack syndrome - the extreme measures a short-stacked player will take to stay in the game. Sure, they might seem extreme for you, but for him they aren't at all extreme. He is forced to play big cards, he has little money behind, why shouldn't he be aggressive and try to get all-in as fast as he can. Don't you do the same thing when you have AA and you're in a weak game, with 100BB or less behind? constant raises or all-in's most hands and as most of them have suffered earlier on in the game at some point (either by being donked out or by making a big mistake themselves) they're completely on tilt and behaving irrationally Again, this is only your perception, as a good short stacker doesn't have a real reason to tilt. He's playing like this, again, because he has high cards and little money behind. How to deal with it? You quite cannot. The main reason is that, if he will play big cards and you will be playing for his stack, not yours, you'll also be forced to take a stand with big cards also, cards that will mostly form TPGK+ or overpairs. You cannot call anymore with a low pair, hoping to set mine, because you don't have implied odds. The only thing you can do is to study the particular opponent and see his opening range, his shoving range, etc. and then construct your own ranges so as you will profit in the long run. I hope it helped!
Good luck! PS: the so called syndrome is no syndrome at all. It's simple short stack play."
Is online poker safe?,"If you think about the Full Tilt case, then the non-US players already play real money games on Full Tilt Poker and are able to deposit or cash out at their own will. In the US it's more problematic, though. But I am not from the US and I cannot give you more info. As far as I can see, you're concerned about the safety of your bankroll on online poker rooms. Fair enough, if you ask me. My answer is basically the same as GazWinter's: it's pretty safe. Full Tilt is now a part of PokerStars, the leading brand in online poker. They have a solid reputation, lots of traffic and there is no real reason for them to go busto in the near future. About the smaller sites, there is a higher chance of them disappearing or, more likely, being bought by other bigger sites and/or networks. Dracula Poker, a Romanian online poker room, was bought by Titan Poker and now the both player pools are merged and play very well and in safety. bwin and Party Poker merged and now bwin is named bwin.party and so on. NoiQ Poker merged with 24h Poker and everything goes great. But there are also sites that, even if they run their business legit, they folded. RPM poker and Poker Nordica are two of the examples that come into my mind. As far as I know, the players that played there got their bankrolls back in full, so nobody was dissatisfied. So, are your money safe? My answer is they are as safe as they are in banks. Sure, a bank might be rock solid now, but it might go bankrupt in 5 years time or who knows what dirty tricks is the CEO up to and everybody will suffer. Money aren't 100% safe nowhere, but I'd say that on Stars they are 99.9999% safe (*), which is fine for me. (*) - The number is an approximation and I cannot say anything about the safety of the lower tier rooms. I hope it helped you!
Good luck!"
Call river all-in after missing flush-draw but hitting AK?,"I'm iffy about your flop bet-size. There are not many hands that you are worse than even-money with on that board. Represent the strength that you have so that your decisions later in the hand are easier. A half pot bet looks like you are just c-betting to c-bet.  Honestly, I prefer either a larger bet to maintain control of the hand, or a similar bet to the one you made, with the intent of 3-bet shoving. You're a coinflip with almost any legit hand in the villain's range (the hands that have you crushed are AA/KK/3x and all are fairly unlikely, both from the perspective of combinatorics and from the perspective of likelihood that a villain gets to the flop with them in this line). You gain value in the dead money when many of the hands you are flipping with fold to a flop 3-bet, and it more than offsets the loss for the times you are beat. Given the flop as played, I am ok with the call on the turn, so long as you are planning to call any river. Your line screams weakness, and could easily be seen as a missed flush draw or as a weak Q. Given this, he has very little reason to expect you to call a big bet on the river, and could do it with any pair, as well as a lot of air. He could also be hoping against hope that this will get him value, but if that's the case it's good to get the read here and now about how he plays his monster hands.  Ultimately though, your play makes your hand look very weak. Since you have under-represented your hand through the small bet on the flop and just calling the tiny turn, you can't give up on the river without more information on this villain."
Hands when playing Omaha,"Yes.  You must use exactly two cards from your hand to make your best 5-card poker hand, so if there were three 9's on the board your best hand would use the 9 and the highest ranked other card from your hand.  For example, if you held KQ97 and the board were 999AJ, your best hand would use the 9 and K, for a best hand of 9999K. Of course, in this case the kicker is meaningless, since no other player can also have quad 9's."
Should I slow play a set?,"Personally I don't like tiny pairs eg. 22,33,44 when EP. These pairs, no matter what, are consistent Losers (highlight) no matter how good you play them from EP. I've read and checked database results (not mine) and they explain that it's just bad to play them on EP. Regardless of this, your call is good for set mining since your stack is > 40 BB (my favourite amount) to give implied odds a chance, although the effective stacks are what you should make use of. For example, if you have 150$ and 2 short rat-holers called you with 15$ and 10$ left, no it's not a good play and should have folded. If you're against similar stacks it's good for set mining, but I prefer higher pairs. Your flop situation is more interesting. Yay, you hit your set but the flop contains a draw. Your primary thought now is to reduce the field eg. kicking out the chasers. You did a horrible (highlight) play by checking/calling eg. slowplaying your 22 set in a drawy, multi-way board.  What if the turn came on a club with a load of players in it ? My preferred move would be to just raise the pot eg. by applying what Harrington referred to as The Hammer (in his book: Harrington on Hold 'em); simply check/raise to what seems to be an aggro opponent. The only way for the others to continue is: Let's see the odds.
Starting pot has 1+2+7+7+7+7 = 31$. You didn't mention how many that couple callers were so I added 2 more callers with a 7$ call here. Big stacker bets 15$ (half pot) into a 31$ pot, thus making it 46$. A couple of calls as well so 46+15+15 = 76$. It's your turn and have around 140$ left, am I right? This is just double the pot. If you call 15$ against an army of callers it's like inviting them to beat your hand. The preferred  move here is to Check/Raise the initial raiser. In fact this pot is a dreamy one for those who have hit their set.  In fact, with too many callers still in hand and my relatively low stack vs Pot, my x3 raise (45$) is not enough. I would move in. If that means everyone will fold, that's equally good! But if a calling station / chaser is stubborn enough to follow, no problem; he has around 20% to beat you anyway with 1 card to come and around 35% for the showdown. But also consider that you have odds to make a full house as well with 2 cards to come. Villain is just aggro with his draws, you should make a note that this dude barrels his draws so next time punish him properly on flop / turn; by the looks of it, he's going to call you. He said 'he had odds[sic]' to call you? lets see: 91$ on the flop (raiser bets, couple and you calls: if my calculations are correct) 116$ on the turn (after raiser bets 25$) 216$ on the turn (after your 100$ raise all-in) Now the big stack has to call 75$ to win a pot of 291$ (let's say 300$) 75 / 300 = 0.25 -> 25% 9 cards to hit flush = 20% If my calculations are correct, no, he doesn't have the expressed cold odds. But this changes if he played you with a bigger set. In this case you're the one walking on thin ice. Opponent could fold or not by preferred choice (check/raise flop + turn) but against aggros you need to either win their whole stack or die. Your passivity lost this pot and it's bad since you had the perfect opponent for this type of hand. UPDATE Actually the 35% and 20% equity by a flush chaser is decided vs a random hand. I fell victim of not pokerstoving your actual hand, a set. In this case the real equities are: As you see, unless you're beaten by another set, you're so ahead you can barrel him to death. Another fun equity: Even if the guy flops the flush, you still have 35% equity against him! In contrast with his hand, your hand can get better with more cards to come. Sets are just so powerful. Not strange since only this hand can form full houses and quads."
NL200: Many possible lines to showdown in this 3-bet pot,"In the ~180 hands played, what has Villain seen of us? That's enough time for a reg at these stakes online to have his own reads/stats on us, and for him to react to it. Knowing what he has seen of us in order to factor in how he might adjust his play specifically against us seems worth consideration. Also, do we have any stats on his 3bet %, his fold to 3bet %, or his street-by-street AF? There would be a lot of error in those stats with such a small sample, but they could come in handy. Ignoring those factors and going with what we know, I actually like the preflop 3-bet based on the read that Villain is straight-forward when out of position. By 3-betting, we build a larger pot in which we will be playing with a significant advantage. Given the straight-forward play, Villain will give up on a number of hands preflop, and define many of his bigger hands for us. Based on that, I do not think that QQ+ is in his range, and I think JJ is in it, but is fairly unlikely (perhaps 50/50 on whether he would call or 4bet pre). Similarly, I think he folds AJ more often than he calls, and he almost never has another Jx/8x hand (as he would fold these preflop when OOP and facing a 3bet). 88 and 44 are both easily in his range, but no more so than each of the other small/medium pairs. Further, I believe that this is the majority of his range: hands that are fairly easy to play OOP, thus justifying him to stay around preflop.  Now we have to consider what he'll believe about us, and how he would react with his pairs under those beliefs. Here again, I'd like to know how often we've been 3-betting, to try to estimate what range he will give us. Certainly he will include AK/AQ/TT+ in our range regardless. Likely he will include a few more pocket pairs, and depending on what he has seen from us, possibly some other misc hands such as strong suited connectors and/or bluffs (many of which could include the J). In general, he will likely consider his pair to be 50/50 with our range. Accordingly, he probably sticks through the flop more often than not, even with pairs that he values fairly little. Any broadway cards that he happens to have will fold, but I think this is a small part of his range. That could argue equally for a bet or a check, as we have a fair bit of equity against the majority of his range and only fold out a fairly small portion of it. Still, I'm inclined to bet the flop. I would rather fold out the few broadway cards and relatively few pairs that he will decide to drop.  Then on the turn, I barrel with a blank or an A/K, and I check behind with anything that improves our hand (looking for a cheap showdown when we hit a T/9 and giving him an opportunity to rep the straight that we have when we hit a Q/7). In the case of an A/K, I barrel the turn and check the river under the thinking that the Villain is not likely to give up on the river. So much of our range has hit the board that he must have hit something as well to call both the flop and the turn. If the turn is a T/9, I check to keep the pot small. At that point we are ahead of most hands that he has in his range, but behind most hands that he will call a turn bet with. By checking, it becomes +EV to call a river bet, and that call is much more +EV than betting the turn. By contrast, if the turn gives us our straight, I check behind in an effort to get the Villain to put more money in the pot. He is more likely to bet the river than to call a turn bet, so we extract more from him this way, and when we raise his river bet, we are still way ahead of his calling/shoving range. As long as the river does not pair the board, we hold the nuts and our hand is hidden enough to get paid off by a fair number of villains hands. There is some danger of the board pairing on the river to de-nut our hand, but I believe the value gained is greater than the amount lost to these situations.  If we reach the river unimproved, I give up in almost all situations, the exceptions being if we have extraordinary reason to believe he will call through to the river and then give up OR if I feel a need to demonstrate my ability to bluff big to establish a specific image."
Best hand versus AA,"I exhaustively simulated (every possibility is run) AA vs any pocket pair and AA vs any suited connector. Firstly let's cover the pocket pairs: Obviously it is best for the under-pair to have different suits, in order to win with flushes. The best pocket pair to have is pocket eights. This is because all straight possibilities will result in a win. This is also the case with sixes and sevens (aces are blocked with pocket fives), but it is important to have a higher pocket pair, since you won't get counterfeit as often when you hit a set. For example with pocket sixes on 6777x results in a loss, while with pocket eights on 8777x results in a win. When we run the odds we get the following: 8s8c (20.20%) vs AhAd (79.80%). Now on to the suited connectors. I didn't even bother to run suited one gappers, since they make less straights and therefore are for sure a bigger dog against aces. The suited connectors that make the most amount of straights are 56-JT. It is important that the hands' suits are different then both aces, since when the flush is made on flop or turn, the aces will not have (extra) outs. Let's make an overview of their equities against aces: 65: 23.06%
76: 23.03%
87: 23.02%
98: 22.62%
T9: 22.77%
JT: 21.72%   JT's equity is the lowest, since his straight outs are blocked by the aces and even when broadway is hit the board has to run out unpaired. T9's equity isn't the best, since the board can run out KQJT, giving aces a better straight. 98's equity isn't best, since the board can still run out KQJT. Now our last 3 hands are extremely close in equity. All the straight that can be made will result in a win. The equities differ however. Let me explain: With 65, A234 and A2345 are blocked by aces. With 76, A2345 is blocked by aces. This explains the fact that 87 has more wins than 76 and 76 has more wins than 65. One would expect 87 to have the highest equity and 65 the lowest, but this isn't the case. The reason for this is the amount of ties each hand makes. The boards A2345-89TJQ, will generally result in a tie. See this image for a nice overview of all possible 'straight boards'. The key is the A2345 straight combination. This straight will happen way less frequently compared to the other straights, because it is blocked by aces.  Essentially the goal is to have the most amount of straight ties. When 65 blocks A2345 obviously some of those ties vanish, but it's better to block A2345 compared to other straights. This is because when a straight is blocked it will occur less, relative to the amount of which it occurs. If A2345 occurs less, you will ultimately lose less absolute straight ties, compared to when another straight board is blocked. As can be seen on the picture 65 is the only hand that blocks A2345, which results in 65 having the most amount of ties. Now let's explain the difference of the amount of ties between 87 and 76. 76 wins on A2345 and 23456. On all other boards 76 will tie. 87 wins on 23456 and 34567. On all other boards 87 will tie. Here you can see that 76 has more ties, since the six boards 76 ties on is not blocked by aces. To conclude:
I exlplained that 87 has the most wins followed by 76 and then 65. However, this difference in wins is relatively unimportant compared to the difference in amount of ties between the three hands. 65 has by far the most amount of ties, followed by 76 and then 78. Therefore 65 has the best equity, then 76 and then 87."
Pre-flop charts 6-max cash games,"I found some opening charts here which you might find useful: 

 

 There is also a chart here with calling, 3-betting and 4-betting ranges: "
Holding pocket tens and flop in KQT suited in Texas Holdem 5 handed cash game,"Raise less pre, 10 - 12 is fine. By betting 15 the pot is already 45 and then any cbet would commit you as you already would have put 50% of your chips into the middle... You have flopped a set and if the board pairs have a full house so you have to think you are ahead at this stage. I would cbet the flop about 2/3 pot and evaluate the turn and shove on any non diamond. In the end you were unlucky and many draw combinations / pair with a diamond would also shove in that position as they have some fold equity."
Small Pairs on early and middle positions,"It is almost always best to see the flop if possible with small pocket pairs. By if possible I mean limping in or calling a small raise. It doesn't pay to add anything after the flop, but a set on the flop, especially a low set, is more hidden and can win some nice pots."
What are the advantages gained by those who cheat?,"There is certainly a number of applications that constantly scans the screen eg. the game tables, offering real time percentages for anything you might think, winning percentage, push/fold situations etc. That is mostly, screen grabbing then computing the images grabbed with pre-grabbed images to find out what the current screen says. This can translate from community cards to stack sizes to active players in table. I myself developed such a program not while ago that could grab the community cards, then compute me a percentage of winning based on my hold cards. Things can't be really more complex since serious applications (like Pokerstars) don't give any other information, except their log files but that's legal to utilize eg. Pokertracker uses these logs files, doesn't do any really complex stuff like DLL injection and such. Restricted apps like, say, Texas Calculatem do exactly this etc. screen grabbing+. Older SNG Wizard version (newer ones are supported) had a mechanism where one could create a scenario for push/fold where Pokerstars didn't liked. I didn't found it on newer versions.  In short, if an application goes the screen grabbing way and calculate real-time statistics is probably considered cheat. You referred bots. These aren't so different by the way, they do exactly the same thing, although some AHK mechanism is in order to make them behave like humans. They're also considered cheat since they're basically AHK + screen grabbing application. Personally i don't think they're worth the effort and $$. The information you get from them they can really be learnt."
Calculating Poker Outs,"The concept of outs is to count the number of cards left on the deck (outs) that will improve your current hold cards (together with board) to a hand that will beat other hands. For example consider you have the hand A♥Q♥ The board comes 7♥3♠9♥ This case is one of the most typical for the outs concept. You need one ♥ to complete your flush, which will be the winning hand (nuts). Of course you don't have to have a calculator on your side for this. There is a simple formula to commit to memory; The 4-2 rule. For the above flush case you just need to do: cards that improve my hand on next card (turn) * 2 9 flushes out there * 2 = 18 Why 9 flushes? because there are 13 cards per rank, we hold the 2 and the board has the other 2 (13 - 4 = 9). 18% is a percentage, so you have 18% to hit the flush out there. (Some people likes to add +1 into the above and get 19% but i personally makes it 20% and be done with it). Now you're knowing the odds you need something to compare to. The whole concept of card odds is to compare them to pot odds. There's no point of just knowing that you have a 18% to win. How to calculate the pot (let's say the pot is 100$ and need to call 20$): amount to call / (current pot + amount to call) 20$ / (100$ + $20) = 0.16 -> 16% You card odds = 18% (or say it's %20, no big deal) Your pot odds = 16% Since your card odds > pot odds, then you call. It's not really difficult, it just takes practice. Another kind of card outs is the straight gutshot, like having K♥J♠ and the board comes T⋄9♣2♠ You're missing the Queen to make the highest straight (nuts) so you're missing 4 cards (outs), so you replace the 9 above with 4 (thus having about the half percentage, 9% to 10% i would like to say in my thought) Obivously the concept of outs gets interesting (or useful) only with specific type of hands, since you need a considerable number of remaining cards to get something of use. It's a waste of time, to get the outs for everything since everything is not a hand that can win everyone else. You have to get a hand that works well with the board for this. Also this example you gave: So 2⋄2♣ on 4♥9♠Q⋄ It's correct that you have 2 outs (the 2 remaining de(o)uches) because these will hit your set. Still there are 2 problems with this: 1) your outs are far too few to even compare 2) there's no guarantee that someone has not a bigger set already. The concept of outs is to try to hit the lock hand (or close to it) In this specific example you just don't calculate the outs; it's a hit or fold. (read about set mining)"
What is the odd of hitting flush when you have nothing,"Your question can be re-written like this: What are the odds of having 4 cards with the same suit, from the 5 available community cards? The answer can be found by using basic probabilities and computing probabilities of composed events.  You can have 5 boards in which 4 cards are of the same suit: Here, X means the suit you're asking for, Y means any other suit. Of course, each of the 5 scenarios have the same likelihood of occurrence.  There are 13 cards of a suit. We'll take out the two preflop cards, which means that we have 12 cards out of 50 in the deck (suppose you're drawing for a flush, otherwise you wouldn't have asked this question). So, one of the 5 scenarios described above occurs with the probability of: (12/50) * (11/49) * (10/48) * (9/47) * (38/46) =0.00177556684098246143971001906776 Because we have 5 scenarios, each having the same probability of occurrence and each one being independent of the other 4 ones, the answer you are seeking for is: P=P(1 scenario)*5=0.88%, So, you will have exactly 4 cards of a given suit, on the river, in 0.88% of the cases. If you consider all community cards coming up hearts, this is 50*49*48*47*46/12*11*10*9*8, which is about 0.03%."
Is it bad etiqutte for the whole table to agree to let someone blind out?,"If there was an agreement to do so I would say that it is a form of collusion and therefore wrong. If it just happens then it should be considered softplay and may draw a warning acording to most tournament rules. By not being there the absent player cannot participate in the hand nor can he see the action taking place. That is to his detriment and if he returns he has lost that information.  But since he was not part of the agreement to checking it down that violates the rules. For example the players can't declare how the prize money is divied up differently than the tournament structure unless all players agree including the tournament host. As soon as any collusionary comments arrise, I always try and stop it dead immediatly. The most common is two players asking if they want to check it down with another player all-in. That doesn't mean I won't check it down, but I will never anounce it or discuss it.  If I suddenly have what I think is a vulnerable but winable hand I will make moves to get the pot. I have won pots that way, I have been stung, knocked out and I have caused other players to survive.  My goal is to win the tornament and sometimes that can upset other players. But it is the way the game is to be played. And the guy who continued to play had every right to do so and some may say, the obligation to try and win the pots he can take with either winning cards or winning moves."
How many chips do you have left?,"You do not ever have to count or tell you opponent your stack size. You will have to move your hands/arms out of the way so that your opponent can see your stack size, though.  It's the dealer's job to tell your opponent how many chips you have if your opponent asks."
Distribution of Badugi Hands,"I was thinking about how to explain my question a bit more and then realised I could work out the answer. I wrote a small python script to count all the badugis one can be dealt. To answer my example, a J-hi badugi is a favorite (53.8%) over any random badugi.
Nearly 31% of all dealt badugis are K-high etc."
Equity calculation,"You should break it into disjoint (non-overlapping) cases, and find the probability that you win with each case, and then add them up: Case 1. Heart on turn Case 2. 8 (not heart) on turn Case 3. 5 on turn Case 4. 4c or 4d on turn Case 5. 3 on turn Case 6. Not a heart, 8, 5, 4, or 3 Overall probability of winning: The left column should add up to 1, since each case is disjoint and we've covered every case. The overall probability is 25.05%. I'm not sure why you're calculator said 25.04%, but I've verified that 25.05% is the correct win%. Perhaps you were using a monte carlo method or it simply had a rounding error. The way to come up with all these cases on your own, is to start small, say by only considering two cases. Case 1. 5 on turn Case 2. Anything else X is hard to calculate, so we should divide this case into more cases, maybe we'll add a 3 on turn case next. Then repeat, adding cases, until each case has a simple to compute probability of winning. You could do this whole procedure in a similar way to calculate your probability of a tie, and then use win% + tie%/2 (assuming only two players) to calculate your actual equity."
Question of declaration in Texas Hold em,"This kind of thing is irritating at best and angle shooting at worst. I suspect whether this is considered a binding action will depend on lots of context, such as the frequency he's been doing this and the intonation of his voice and the level of confusion of the other players in the hand after one of these incidents. Not all ""I want to call"" statements are created equal. For example, if he's tanking after a big bet into him, and he slowly says ""I want to call"" as part of some lengthy deliberations, I think you might reasonably assume that this doesn't qualify as stating an action. But if he's just casually saying ""I wanna call"" when any action's on him and he's thrown in chips after each statement, it might reasonably be interpreted as a call.  The real problem exists if this player is using this ambiguity to gain some sort of advantage, as in trying to discern the actions of players behind him while still trying to give himself a way out of a binding action. A good dealer and floorperson would help put a stop to any such shenanigans. As another player at the table here, you should be careful that you understand the real action in front of you before you act. So, I think my answer here is a big ""it depends."" But the fact that you're even asking this question implies that this player was using this as a strategic tactic, which in my mind put it in the angle shooting category. When in doubt, clarify the action with the dealer, and if the player keeps it up, you might discuss it with the floorman."
What is the correct calculation to make various combinations of Hold'em hands?,"Based on your calculations... If you hold 4 cards (A to 4), you will ALWAYS make a pair? Estimate with 3/50 * 5 instead of the annoyingly similar fractions:
(3/50 * 5) * 4 = 60/50 !? ===---=== The reason you won't get the right answer this way even though I can see the logic in your math is because of ""double counting"". You think the chance of hitting the right card in the first card on the flop is 3/50 and the chance of hitting the right card in the second card on the flop is 3/49, but you can't add those two together because they are not exclusive. You are forget about the chances that you hit BOTH first card and second card (so you got trips). So the real straight forward logical math will look like: 6/50 = 0.12 (this is the chance of hitting one of your cards on the FIRST card) 44/50 * 6/49 = 0.1078 (this is the chance of hitting one of your cards on the SECOND card) 44/50 * 43/49 * 6/48 = 0.0956 (3rd card) 44/50 * 43/49 * 42/48 * 6/47 = 0.0863 (4th card) 44/50 * 43/49 * 42/48 * 41/47 * 6/46 = 0.0769 (5th card) Total: 0.12 + 0.1078 + 0.0956 + 0.0863 + 0.0769 = 0.487 (rounded up to get rid of the least significant digit. Note: the 5 equations can be combined to this one:
6/50 * (1 + 44/49 + 44/49*43/48 + 44/49*43/48*42/47 + 44/49*43/48*42/47*41/46) = 0.487 You can verify this by calculating 1 - (chance of hitting nothing) 1 - (44/50 * 43/49 * 42/48 * 41/47 * 40/46) = 0.487 It's much easier to calculate the probability of NOT hitting your cards and then subtract that from total (one), however, it's also good to understand the straight forward logical math too (calculating the probabilities of each individual events and then adding them properly) ===---=== For other combination of cards on the river, you will need to first identify how many distinct combo they can be in, and then calculate the exact probability for one variation of that combo... For example, calculating Trips (with two different hole cards): You want the two cards to match one of your hole cards, so you have this many situations:
11---, 101--, 1001-, 10001, 011--, 0101-, 01001... etc... That's 4+3+2+1 = 10 combinations. (where 1 is success, 0 is fail, - is doesn't matter) So for 11---, you get: 6/50 * 2/49 * 1 * 1 * 1 for 101--, you get: 6/50 * 47/49 * 2/48 * 1 * 1 for 1001-, you get: 6/50 * 47/49 * 46/48 * 2/47 * 1 ... I will not list all 10, but you SHOULD understand the pattern..."
Research on the effect of a screen name or avatar in online poker,"Poker players on real poker sites choose their name wisely, by that I mean they want to play there often and choose a real nick like ""Destroyer666"" or ""Billy the Cid"" whatever. But they won't go for PEtewr345353 or Hello324234  , it's not about the name only, it's more about the player who choose the name. I sometimes like a rude name like ""r4p3tim3""  but i chose that with care and not just because it's rude or something. What I want to point out is, that the name shows you if the player plays often or not. strange numbers after the name is an indicator for someone who created the account just for fun and they probably dont play with bankroll management and everything , so they are probably fishes."
What if a home game player is physically unable to deal? Skip or substitute?,"I don't think you will find any ""official"" rules about this situation because in most ""official"" poker tournaments/cash games the players do not deal themselves anyway. It would be a bad idea to skip his deal because, as you already pointed out, this would disturb the seating positions. Just have someone deal for him - in the right order of course (clockwise, starting with the small bet). Since this is a home game, you can make the rules - just make sure everyone knows and agrees to them."
What's a good strategy for playing overpairs post flop? [closed],"You did not specify the suits.  So, disreguarding a possible flush here is what I would do: Current Odds
A pocket pair of Qs 10s or 7s would have you dominated. The odds of someone actually having pocket Qs 10s or 7s is 3 in 221 or roughly 1.3%.   Another hand that could be ahead of you is two pair.  The odds of someone hitting two pair while holding unpaired hole cards is 49 to 1 or 2%. The other hand that could possibly have you is pocket AA.  The odds of someone actually holding pocket AA is 1 in 221 or roughly 0.45%. Playing the Player
So looking at those odds, there is a pretty good chance that the other opponents do not have anything better than you.  Your position in the hand could have told you a lot as well.  If you were last to act and nobody raised in front of you or their raise was weak then they likely don't have pocket AAs.  Now if you are out of position and put in a sustantial raise and get called by two people, then there is a better chance of one of the two having a really good hand like AA, AK, AQ, or QQ.  You really get this kind of information by paying attention to betting pattern during the course of the game.   Future Odds
Now with the above in mind you may be confident that you are ahead in the hand.  However, there are still two more cards to come and you may not be ahead in the end.  So what draws could possibly beat you?  Excluding the flush possibilities and open ended straight draw is the best drawing hand at this point.  There is the possibility of someone having a straight draw, maybe K J, J 9, or 9 8.  If you bet heavy before the flop then it is unlikely that these hands would have stuck around unless they were suited.    Lets say that they did stick around and they are trying to hit the straight.  The odds of someone completing a open ended straight after the flop is roughly 31%.  Wow now that is better odds. What I would do
So, considering all of the above there is a very good chance that you are way ahead right now.  However, the open ended straight draw would have me worried.  I would bet heavy to let the opponents know that you have a great hand and they should get out while they can.  If they both fold then great you make a profit on the hand.  If one of the players come along for another card then figure out your odds again while always watching the opponent for any give aways. For more on odds calculations check out Poker Probability."
What are the most important things to consider when choosing a poker coach?,"The absolute most important thing is for the coach to have relatively recent experience solidly beating the game you are interested in learning at the level you are learning and one or two levels beyond it. If you're struggling at $0.25/$0.50 games, someone who plays the $500/$1000 games will not be the best coach for you to learn from, as much of their game is not applicable to the players you face. The next most important thing is communication skills and style. To be of use to you, a coach must be able to clearly communicate thought processes to you. It is much better to have a coach whose poker experience seems less impressive but can actually pass their knowledge on to you (as long as they still meet point one) than to have a coach who destroys the game but can't adequately teach you the reasons they make the plays they make. Everyone will benefit most if you have some idea of what parts of your game you would like to see improved through coaching. If you can identify such an area, then address it with the coach you are considering signing up with. Ask if that is a strong area for them and look for sessions based on that area. Several years ago, I had tournament coaching from Eric ""Rizen"" Lynch. I went into that coaching with a general knowledge of MTT play - I'd read the only Harrington book out at the time and had several hundred tournaments under my belt. I also had thousands of SNGs under my belt with a huge win-rate, meaning that final table play was already an area I excelled at. Thus the primary areas I needed assistance with were middle-MTT concepts, large-field bubble play, and big-stack adjustments. In just a few weeks, the number of final tables I made doubled as a result of these targeted sessions. Had I not known where to focus, there would have been a much longer period of figuring out where I was and covering concepts that I already knew. I have always found sweat sessions (where I'm watching the coach play OR the coach is watching me play) to be the most beneficial type of coaching. That's doubly true in the tournament arena, since you can easily enough only do sweating over the parts of the game you need to improve. On the other hand, if you are at a complete loss as to what you might need improvement on, having a coach review a fairly large block of hands may be the best way to approach the first session. This way they can find leaks which can become the subject of targeted sessions later on."
Why would a player ask how many chips another player has during a hand?,"It affects strategy in no-limit, and especially pot-limit play. Some simple examples: There's $300 in the pot, and you plan to try a $200 bluff to take it. Well, if one of your opponent's only has $50 left, then you're really only betting $50 at him, and he can call with much less risk. Similarly, if you make a $50 bet on an early round, and your opponent only has $80 in his stack, he will be more inclined to call than if he had $500, because in the latter case he has to worry about your future bets as well. Another case: There's $100 in the pot, your opponent bets $20, and you have a gutshot. You only have 6-to-1 pot odds for an 11-to-1 draw. But consider this: if you and your opponent both have a lot more chips, and you think he will bet when your well-hidden gutshot card comes, and you think he'll reluctantly call your raise, then you'll get paid off at much more than 11-to-1 when you hit. This is called implied odds. So this is an automatic fold with small stacks, a reasonable call with large ones. In pot limit, you often have a monster, suspect your opponent has a strong second place, and you have to figure out whether betting out or check-raising will get all your opponent's chips in. That's a function of the size of the pot and the size of his stack. There are thousands of other cases. I wouldn't say that your opponent's stack size matters on every hand (after all, you'll routinely fold most hands), but it matters quite often. Roy Cooke's book on no-limit poker has an entire chapter called ""How deep are you"", in which every exercise is a sample hand with different answers depending on stack sizes."
Bet denied after having hit the table pre-river,"This is a little tricky. A non-verbal check is generally defined as ""knocking or taping the table.""  So a single hit on the table with a fist does generally qualify as a check. Checking in the dark is a completely legal move.  And since the bettor would have been next to act after the card is dealt, the non-verbal check motion might qualify as a check in the dark. However, there are not really a lot of established rules or precedent around a non-verbal check in the dark. I honestly don't think I have every seen a check in the dark that was not verbalized. Now, I might be wrong here, but in my experience, that just never happens.  Saying that the bettor's table pound was a check in the dark is an incredibly literal interpretation of the rules, especially if that player verbalizes most actions anyway and the table agrees with the player. So, dealer is not necessarily wrong, but there needs to be some room for discretion here.  If this is a home game, a friendly game, then the bettor's actions are super clear, and this should not be an issue.  If this is a casino game then remember to tip your dealer (although perhaps not this particular dealer)."
NL200: Am I A Super-Nit For Considering Folding The Turn With TPGK?,"There're only two options here, shove or fold so I don't think you're a nit by stopping to think. On the turn he's making a min raise and nearly committing himself to the pot (he has 45BB left with a 60BB pot) which looks to me pretty strong and definitively hints at a hand there, given the way it's being played, no matter what card comes on the river if you call you'll face all-in in the final street so you might as well take the decision now. He also called from the worst possible position, the SB with the BB still to act, I'm putting him on Ax or total bluff In this spot I think you have to consider what your opponent thinks you have... you called as the button, tried to steal on the flop and double barreled on the turn, definitively looks like a bluff to me so probably he's putting you on a weak hand, given how deep you are and the good odds that you have of having the best hand, I would shove.

What is the official procedure for starting a hand in texas holdem heads up?,"The key is the button represents the dealer,  the dealer doesn't deal himself/herself first.  So, the first card goes to the big blind player in heads-up. According to heads up poker rules, the dealer posts the small blind and the other player posts the big blind. The first card is dealt to the player in the Big Blind. The dealer acts first pre-flop and the big blind acts first on the flop, turn, and river. The dealer always goes last on the flop, turn, and river. from link mentioned below https://automaticpoker.com/poker-basics/heads-up-game-play-rules-for-texas-holdem/ From Wikipedia: When only two players remain, special 'head-to-head' or 'heads up' rules are enforced and the blinds are posted differently. In this case, the person with the dealer button posts the small blind, while his/her opponent places the big blind. The dealer acts first before the flop. After the flop, the dealer acts last and continues to do so for the remainder of the hand. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_hold_%27em"
Help with a tournament hand - KK in SB,"I haven't looked at the revealed answer yet, and I'm not experienced in tournaments, so YMMV. You haven't said anything about the button's tendencies.  Two calls of raises in this hand pre-flop could mean that he's hoping to sneak in with AA or maybe he's a little looser pre-flop because he feels like his stack size gives him some freedom. He would probably have re-popped you with AK,QQ+ after your pre-flop re-raise, so I'd put his range well behind yours at this point. His just calling what looked like a squeeze might mean he thinks his hand can stand some heat, though, and this seems like as good a place as any to lure a guy like you who is both aggressive and shorter than him. The pot is around 10200 here, and your stack is now only around 18000. You figure to have the best hand at this point and you should want to get all-in. If the villain is likely to bet if checked to, I'd check-raise all in. If he's likely to check behind if checked to it's a little more complicated because your stack doesn't give you much flexibility, since any reasonable bet on the flop will leave you with far less than a pot sized bet behind on the turn. If you think check-raising won't work, I'd shove here. You'll likely get called by anything that hit this flop, most of which you're ahead of. You'll see AA or JJ or 66 occasionally, but you'll also see a lot of AJ and lesser pocket pairs. And you'll get folds from hands that weren't going to give you action anyway. So, I'm saying that on the flop you should check-raise all-in an aggressive villain or just shove against a not-so-aggressive one."
Do Odds Change if Count of Players at Table Change?,"Before anyone speaks, no matter how many players there are the distribution is still totally random. Each card has, for example, exactly the same probability to be in anyone's hand. However as soon as someone speaks then things change... What does this do to the overall win/lose odds of a given hand? Simply put: as soon as a person folds the probability is higher (a tiny bit higher, but higher nonetheless) that the next players will get better cards than if the same player didn't fold. This can also be put as: ""People do not fold AA"" (neither KK, nor QQ, nor AKs, etc.). So for example if you're, say, on the button with AK, the more people fold the more likely you are to catch an A or a K. Contrarily to popular belief this effect is something that can be measured and some people have been doing just that: analysing billions of (online) hands and noticing that the flop distribution was definitely not perfectly random. As I've already answered in another question, Barry Greenstein himself wrote, (page 150 of ""Ace on the River""), the following: ""...If several players fold first, Ace-King suited is a favorite over most pairs. ...(snip)... The reason for this is that players are more likely to play hands having an Ace or King than those containing smaller cards. Therefore, as players fold, the probability of an Ace or King coming on the board increases"" So although in a heads-up game your AsKs is about a 47.6% underdog vs 8h8c, it becomes a favorite with over 50% to win in a 6 players game where 4 players folded. So this is noticeable. In game theory, poker is a game of ""imperfect information"" (as opposed to, say, chess which is a game of perfect information) and as soon as the first player either bets or fold, you have information. Not much information and very hard to exploit but it is still information. Once again: it's not much, but it's enough to, say, change AK from 47.61% underdog to a favorite with a bit above 50% chance of beating a pocket pair. I've answered basically the same in another question here (*). Now if that fact can help a player or not, that is another topic altogether: I only know this AK example because it's a great example Barry Greenstein came up with... I also remember a great blog post / article which was showing the distribution of cards over billions of flops and you could clearly see that it wasn't a totally random distribution but I never found that blog post / article back : ("
What are the measures you should useto tell how well you're doing in a tournament?,"As a very quick estimation of where I stand, I do use the average stack as an indicator.  But, if I'm in a tournament with more than a few hundred players left, I'm constantly aiming to have at least twice the average stack. Even then I'm not entirely comfortable.  To put it differently, if I have average stack, I consider myself to be in a weak position and at risk of going out if I don't take down some pots asap. Average stack moves so fast in MTTs, that you should aim for a multiple of the average stack at all times, to have any chance at weathering a bad beat or to tide you over while you're waiting for some playable cards in a playable position."
What time of day are poker players at their best/worst?,"Americans can't play much online poker since Black Friday because it's illegal for banks to process transactions to or from online poker sites. There are a few sites, such as Merge and the like, which will allow US players but they are relatively low volume compared to PokerStars and Full Tilt. If you're looking to play the highest amount of fish you should target Europeans and Russians. Play during their evening, especially on Friday/Saturday nights. Weekends are 24/7 action as well. Really, this question is far too broad since it depends entirely on your location, availability, and so on."
What is top N% of hands in PokerStove?,"To answer the question, ""What is exactly N% of top hands?"", there really is no correct answer as it depends on the stage of play (i.e. Preflop, Postflop) that's currently occuring. Specifically, it isn't VPIP/PFR. Making use of these programs and hand-rankings is a matter of hand reading skill. The hand-rankings are a generalization of how a player should enumerate the plausible combinations in their opponents range according to the situation at hand. Just as the Pokerstove FAQ mentions, hand-ranking systems are arbitrary because the nature of the game will rarely, if ever, present players with situations that conform to linear orderings of hand equity match-ups. To put it another way that's well known, ""it depends""! Looking a little deeper, there have been a number of methods used to rank hand match-ups according to differing scenarios, preflop and postflop. Pokerstove uses, as they mention, an arbitrary measure of All-In equity vs. Three random hands. What is commonly called hot-and-cold equity, as it relates to showdown equities without any extra raises or folds involved, from any street onward. The full equity breakdown is found in a zip file through this page here: Holdem Preflop Match-Ups. Other hand-ranking systems such as Sklansky-Karlson (aka. Sklansky-Chubukov), the inception of which is here: The Sklansky-Karlson All In No Limit Holdem Rankings I believe relate to a limited game of SB vs. BB dynamics and specifically push-fold ranges, more suited to tournament scenarios. PokerProTools uses an ""evolutionary computer simulation, whereby the set of ""good hands"" is gradually refined, and hands are ranked against other ""good hands"""". It's based on a scientific papers findings (The Challenge of Poker, Billings et al.). I've skimmed, and read over this paper a few times and, as you'd expect, it's a dense scientific piece of writing but still carries lots of insight in plain English about determining relative hand strength. This is where I found it some time ago: Towards a Meaningful Ordering of Hands I'm sure there are more rankings systems than these, as I can recall a few being mentioned on Poker.SE already, but these are probably the most referenced versions. I came to realise that good observation of your opponents tendencies should cause you to create detailed individualised hand-rankings based on your opponents play, and that these systems are good as starting points, but won't ever be definitive examinations of what your opponents are doing in real time."
Is Manipulating Your Own Table Image Beneficial?,"Live
Live is where you can do mostly of the image you project to people.  Some people just get irritated by some things like (your voice,how you dress, the way you talk etc..) These things depend on who your against to. Everyone has something that he doesn't like you only have to find it out.  Player style Agressiv type Im an agressiv player and know when people have a hand or not mostly.
That makes me a winner over the long term. What i tend to do is make the table hate me (by playing lots of hands and 3-4bet alot)and put myself in a spotlight position, where i put everyone in a position where they just want to outplay me and often just loose money by trying.  It's realy risky strategy since i have to play lots of hands and do alot of decisions, but most of the time thanks to my reads im able to make realy good profits over the sessions. Friendly type I saw many players being realy nice to other players (making jokes, having nice conversation, animating table with nice talks etc..)  This type of players do benefit something from being nice.  A situation which happened in a tourney was that the nice guy was in a position where one guy who had flush A high (the nuts there) checked while the nice guy wanted to raise with his 3 of a king but the other guy persuaded him not to. He decided to check.  This way the nice guy didn't get busted because the other guy didn't want him out of the tourney because of that nice talk they had during the tourney. Full stack Image Having full stack when entering tables makes a huge difference in point of image you give.  Lots of players don't want to play against full stack player cuz they can stack them. Those kind of player come to enjoy playing and don't come to gamble, they try to survive rather than going all-in in some good spots where they should to.
You can easly spot those players who lose each round some blind and play realy rarely(tight players). Online Online i think there's no point in manipulating your image unless your a regular and playing against another regular(who's playing <7 tables).  Someone who's playing >6 tables isn't checking for tells/user image mostly cuz he doesn't have the time to do so, trying manipulate image here makes no sense from my point of view."
What is the nature of Omaha starting hands?,"If one is a hold em player, after playing Omaha as a serious student for a time you will notice that with starting hands you will be playing less hands than in Holdem, and if you are playing 8 or better you will be playing even less hands then in Omaha high. Omaha is a drawing game. It is rare for pocket pairs to win straight out at showdown. Big pairs really do not have enough value to make a hand all by them selves. Indeed any two holdem cards that may rank well on a starting range table, do not have enough value by themselves to give positive expectation to an Omaha hand.* *Comments about expectation are general, things like if your playing limit or PLO, or the nature of your opponents that would effect EV are not within the scope of the question. I am using the term EV (Expected Value) loosely, as a ratio of value between hands, rather then the more standard way that assigns a actual money value to a hand. The EV of all Omaha hands falls within a much narrower range then the EV of all holdem hands. The EV of the worst starting hand in holdem is more negative than the worst starting hand in Omaha and the EV of the best starting hand in Holdem is more positive then the EV of the best starting hand in Omaha. On the flop the lose of EV is more pronounced then it is in holdem. In holdem you don't often hit or miss a flop with some hands like big pairs, or you may hit a flop with middle pairs and back door outs. Missing a flop in Omaha you are virtually drawing dead. Hitting weak you are generally drawing much thinner then you would be with Holdem. In other words what ever cards you have in your hand need to have a stronger piece of the flop in Omaha then in Holdem.  Whatever that piece of the flop is, the real quality of an Omaha hand unlike most holdem hands, is determined by what that hand can become, and what those cards in your hand defend against other players cards becoming.  To give you a simple example: your hand is 9945. Flopping a set of nines with the flop 789, is not really that good of a hand. Your straight draw is worthless, it is a gut shot and your drawing to the bottom end. If their are any suites on the flop, more players have cards to beat you. If the game is eight or better your value is even less.  Lets consider why you might play this hand as a holdem player. You have two reasonable holdem hands, pocket nines and 4-5. Pocket nines you would play from any position, and also have lots of scenarios were you might raise or call a raise. 4-5 a reasonable hand to play in late position when there is no raise, even more reasonable if it is suited. If your 4-5 suites hit either of the nines or bravo double suites with the nines, that is even better, and you just had your first ""thinking like an Omaha Player moment"", congrats. If a holdem player is aware of outs they may consider playing either of these two hands in a mathematical context, that may go something like I have this many cards to make two pair, this many to make a straight, so many to make a flush, add those all up, and say to themselves that I have 18% chance of winning this pot, add a little EV for position and maybe even a little more EV because calling station Joe has called. In Omaha the holdem player might go through this and speculate that one hand has EV of 18% and the other hand has EV of 22% so they will give the EV of the Omaha hand 20%, and be the fifth limper in. The problem here as any Omaha player will tell you is that there is no way this hand has an EV of 20%, this hand is junk.(Not to say it might not have an ev of 20%, the real EV is not known because you don't know what everyone else is playing).
You cant really think in those kind of holdem calculations. In holdem the complexity of the hand as a benchmark is (2x2), in Omaha the complexity benchmark is (2x2x2x2). When you look at how the Holdem player came to his conclusion, the bench mark formula was (2x2+2x2/2). One is not accounting for the complexity of the hands and can never come to a correct assessment of the hands EV. If you consider this benchmark relative to the holdem benchmark, in a practical sense it presents some problems. Hand rankings and ranges are especially problematic. It is not practical to memorize the hands in rankings or to memorize the hands in ranges. It also makes counting outs simply impractical as a consideration and outs are not really all that valid like in holdem, post flop in Omaha. Typing hands in Omaha is the basic nuts and bolts of figuring out the ranking of an Omaha hand on the fly. We know the ranking of Holdem hands through card sense or memorizing of ranking tables, but in Omaha you need to understand what makes a hand rank, because it is not simply about the value of the cards, it is also the value of the how the cards relate to each other, and how they relate to your opponents hand. In Omaha saying your cards must work with each other is a severe understatement and saying your hands should consist of high ranking cards is also a severe understatement. A really great hand in Omaha high, much less great in eight or better is A-A-K-K. In holdem, any AA,KK,AK hand has a very high likelihood of success. These are all rank one hands in every holdem ranking table. Hard to play them bad, even harder for any player to think they may have played them badly when they won with them. All you really do when you play these hands is think about maximizing the pot size until you have reason to believe that may not be wise. In Omaha like all Omaha hands, this hand is simply not that great until the flop. All Omaha hands sit within a very narrow range of value compared to all holdem hands. Typing any hand before the flop is relatively simple and mistakes do not have near the impact as misjudging your hands value in holdem.   There is lots of information about Omaha starting hands in books and online. Bob Caiffone wrote the Omaha bible and that is were you should start. Starting hands are generally good if they start as wrap arounds or pairs with kickers that wrap near the pairs. Suits marginally improve the hand, if your a strong player. Large suits improve the hand. A hand like 8,9,10,J has more outs then a hand like AAKK. Two pair or OK, much better if the pairs connect to each other, a little better if they are suited. But the real conversation about what makes a starting is about what makes that hand work (or fail) on the flop.  In Omaha the flop is were your hand becomes! That subject is complex and deep. Way beyond the scope of the question. But this complexity is directly related to ones starting hand, making that a large part of the discussion. In a very basic way many starting hands are a lot more trouble after the flop in Omaha then they are in Texas Holdem. Counting your outs after the flop in holdem is a reasonably accurate way to assess the value of your hand, in Omaha it is only a small part of assessing the value of your hand. You determine the value of an Omaha hand according to its type rather than according to its rank.    I would like to say to the OP that I hope you have a little better understanding of starting hands in Omaha compared to starting hands in Holdem, but I am the OP and that would be strange."
What is the minimum raise after an all-in?,"• The minimum legal raise is equal to the previous raise amount. • If the previous all-in raise amount was less than the minimum raise, then the minimum raise is equal to the previous minimum raise. • If a player goes all-in for less than the minimum legal raise after the open raiser, and is called by at least another player, the open raiser will only be able to call or fold, because the all-in is not at least equal to the minimum raise.  Example : UTG raises 200. CO goes all-in for 275. BTN calls. Action back to UTG. UTG can only call or fold. Look at the hand as if the all-in player had only called, and everything should be clearer."
Gap concept and pot odds,"Sklansky's statement is nothing more than just statistics. Looking at your stats in PokerTracker you will see that in most cases preflop callers have better hands than preflop raisers. If your raise has two calls preflop, then the second call will be ""stronger"" than the first on the distance. Really, better pot odds can make someone call with boundary hand (like small pair) and join the multipot, and you will dominate him. But in most cases you are playing against one opponent. Especially with respect to the later stages of MTT."
What do you do when you get junk in draw poker?,"I generally will fold unless there is no bet to call. Investing in a bad hand generally gets you a negative return. If there is no bet to call in the big blind or it's an ante game, I would hold the highest ranks in the following: As you can see you are drawing three cards to fill a flush or straight and more likely end up with high card or a mediocre pair. Not really worth investing in in the first place. I fold often conserving my bets while I watch my opponents throw money in the pot playing random best hand. When I do come in I have a real shot at collecting. The reason I would hold gapped connectors is that the chance of making a pair is the same for high or low cards, so if you can also make a straight it gives you more possible hands to make."
Is just calling the big blind a poor strategy?,"When the author of the post says ""**Just** calling the big blind..."" (emphasis is mine) he's referring to a strategy style where the only move some players make when opening the action is to call the big blind. I agree that it's a bad choice. I don't believe he was stating, as you say, that someone should always raise or fold preflop. His use of the phrase ""...for the most part."" was alluding to the idea that taking any action all of the time is a poor strategy choice. Sometimes calling, sometimes raising, sometimes folding, depending on your opponents tendencies is best. How you balance those actions, giving preference to any one of them at any time, is what adjusting strategically is about. Your opponents aggression, positional awareness, and table dynamics will all guide your decision here. In short, I believe you're assuming the author to have said something that he hasn't. It's still an interesting point though. On the whole, choosing an agressive strategy (prediminantly betting & raising vs. calling) is vastly superior to a passive one considering the most common poker situations you'll be confronted with these days. It's a good place to start. You'll certainly need to progress from this point though. So, I went through the article quickly and a couple of things stood out to me. The author says it himself, using a starting hand guide like this is if ""you haven't quite found your feet when it comes to starting hand selection yet."" Experience will eventually dictate your decisions about the best actions to take, even if that actually is calling from the big blind all the time. Also, the equity distribution of starting hands is NOT linear. The ""Chen Formula"" tries to equate for this weakness, but is less flexible than is best as hand strengths are relative, not absolute. For example, Many players think AA is just as much better than KK, as KK is better than QQ. It isn't. This graph illustrates that point...  The equity advantage of starting hands is exponential. Chens formula give more weight to Aces than to Kings, etc. but that will mean nothing on, for example, a four flush board with no card of that suit in your hand! Good luck :)"
What is the origin of the all-in bet?,"""Table stakes"" rules are essentially as old as poker itself. My copy of Foster's Practical Poker (1905) says that some games would allow borrowing or going to pocket, but even then going all in was more common. There was an extra important rule: if you borrowed or went to pocket in order to raise, you were no longer allowed to go all in if reraised, but had to go to pocket to call or fold. TV and movies get a lot of things wrong, most notably string raises and WAY too much table talk."
Do all players have to show their hand if they check on the river?,"There are 2 main cases to the ""who must show the cards"" rule: 1). The last-aggressor situation. This applies when there is some betting activity on the river. Let's take some examples: Let's say there are 3 players playing (Small-Blind, Big-Blind and Under-the-Gun) and they got to the river. When there is betting activity going on, the ""who is first after the Dealer"" order of acting is always in effect. Both the cases above overwrite this rule, as you can see (players in later positions end up acting first). This may feel ""unnatural"" at first, but you'll see that it makes sense and it's quite easy to get used to it. (all the cases above are kind of the same, but I included them to show that both making a bet and making a raise will make you the last aggressor). 2). The check-check situation. This applies when everyone checks on the river a.k.a. no betting activity (this is the situation you're most interested in, from what I can tell). In this case, the first player left to the Dealer must show his cards. Going clockwise, subsequent players can each choose to show or muck, as they see fit. Please note that these are the ""official"" rules. Each casino or home-game organizers can make up their own rules. However, you'll rarely see this, since it's pretty standard. But you will see a lot of players or even dealers who often get it wrong. I see it all the time..."
What data should you keep track of to improve your game?,"If you're doing this entirely by hand, tracking hand count and hands per hour is a bit overkill in my opinion (unless you're single tabling I suppose). If you figure that on average there are 85 hands an hour per table, you can use that time to instead watch the table. I would definitely factor in your mental state, I use 1-3, as well. This will help you see just how much money you lose when you play on tilt and hopefully prevent you from spewing stacks on your next session. At least for me, my mental game was my biggest leak - by far. A notes column would be beneficial as well! I would then take it a step further and automate most of the remaining columns. Here's a sample spreadsheet. If you have a Google Account, you should be able to copy it and tweak it to your liking if you'd like. You can see my profit is automatically calculated (and color coded), my total time is auto-tracked, and my mental state is color coded as well. That's just for bankroll management, which will go a long way in improving your game. The next step would be to download a trial copy of PokerTracker (or related software) and load some hand histories into it (You do have to take extra steps with Bovada, but since you didn't specify where you play I'll continue on).  I would definitely at least try the demo version of PokerTracker, because the wealth of information you'll get about yourself from there is insane. You'll know if you're playing too many/few hands, if you aren't aggressive enough, and it will even find leaks. I can't recommend it enough."
"How often, and how much, should I bluff on the river when I miss my flush but a possible straight comes?","The number one consideration here is your opponent's tendencies. Are they the type to be scared away, or are they the type to make a crying call? Also, what was the action prior to this point and what does that lead you to believe your opponent holds? What was the preflop action? How large were your bets? Exactly what community cards are we talking about also has a big impact here on how scarey things will be to your opponent. Moreover, that will determine whether you hitting the straight is even a believable story. The more likely they are to hold a strong hand (or, worse, hold the hand you're representing), the less inclined you should be to bet. Pot size and opponent stack size only really enter into this as factors that might affect your opponent's tendency to call.  The action up to this point and the types of plays you have seen from them in previous hands are both far more relevant factors here."
Probability of x pocket pairs at a table of n people (NLHE)?,"I assume the value n is reasonable for a poker table (n = [2, 10]). In this case, it won't be relevant for the result. You start with 52 cards. You give the first player a card. The probability that the second card you give him has the same rank so that he'll get a pocket pair is: 3 / 51 (the 3 cards of the same rank that remained out of the remaining total of 51 cards). After this, you can repeat the same rationale for the 2nd player: first cards and 3 / 49 chance that the second one will be a matching rank. Extrapolating to x players, you get the following formula (in pseudo-code): Like I said: n is irrelevant in this calculation. And this makes sense, if you think about it. The problem with this formula is that it doesn't take into account the situation when the matching card of the one you get was already dealt to another player. But there's just no way to know that... (or maybe there is, but it's way too complicated). PS: Applying the formula to 3 players gives you 1 / 4350. It's not that improbable. Actually, it's sufficiently probable that it made this actually happen."
"What happens when you break the ""No talk rule""?","In the thread You linked, there are a lot information about this topic.
I try to make a little summary here. Official poker rules doesn't say too much about behaviour at the tables(nearly nothing). There are a document, made by the Poker Tournament Directors Association, that defines a collection of rules to make the game better, simpler and more ethic. Many big tournaments use these rules (mostly in America). You can find the rules HERE. As you can see, on the last page there are a few sections about the penalty problem, saying: Tournament staff can assess a 1-hand penalty,
  1-, 2-, 3-, or 4-round penalties or 
  disqualification. So, even with these rules, the penalty depends on the tournament staff and the exact situation. Since it is impossible to define a rule for every type of sentence a player can say, there used to be an experienced judge, who decides about the penalties. This judge can be a floorman, or, in smaller casinos the dealer him/herself.  It is possible, that some casinos and tournaments make their own rules and penalties to make the situations and the decisions more simple. If You want to play at a casino and it has its own rules, You should read them to avoid bad surprises like disqualification. If the casino has no such a collection of rules, You can not refer to some general poker rules(to defend your behaviour), You will be in the hands of the judge."

Simple final table tournament play including push/fold,"Playing push/fold in SNG or Tournaments is sometimes tough part of game with multiple factors deciding your optimal moves. You can certainly make tables for different common situations and use them in your decision process to get general idea. However, I'm worried that there is no ""easy to remember"" strategy guideline for PUSH/FOLD phase. SNG wizzard or ICM trainer can give you some insight about playing in common and also rather tough and rare situations. Also you can use them to take push/fold tests and train yourself up. I want to note, that winning SNG reg should be able to decide PUSH/FOLD correctly in more then 95-97% when situation settings(number of players, average stack, number of all-ins before your action.) in these tests are random. Good luck at the table!"
"Aces cracked promotion, good for the collective or good for the individual dilemma?","A safe betting strategy that's almost always better than slow play but almost never optimal: Pre-flop: Post-flop You can optimize at low risk but its a complicated calculation and situation dependant. Basically amounts to relearning postflop play. Its not the type of calculation youd want to do at the table so you might want to run some equity calculations in a few common spots just to get a feel for it. Some common rules: Players wont fold anything but marginal longshots due to the large implied odds, so you can calculate how much you can value bet while only loosing action from those long shots from paying off."
Heads Up NL Holdem: Best strategy against all in every hand,"Of course that you can beat both systems by calling with KK+, but we are here to win and exploit our opponents, so we won't play only the nuts. You can build your own calling ranges to get the preflop equity that you want, but remember that here there is a trade-off between equity and how many times you actually win the HU battle. If you play only AA, against a random hand you're an 85% favorite... but how often do we get AA? Against shoving every hand, my best bet is to call with 22+ and AJ+. This might seem a little nitty, but you will win, in the long run, in about 68% of the time, with the added bonus that your opponent will never know if you'll call or not and, until he figures out your strategy, he'll get stacked off 7 times out of 10. You can add some more hands in the mix, if you like to gamble, but I'm more of a pragmatic type and I want to win also. So, I'll stick with the range stated earlier. Against Sklansky's method, it's even easier. You know his ranges, you know his play, so it won't be a big deal building a counter-exploitive strategy.  If there is a raise in front of you, then you go all-in if you have any of the following hands:
  A pair of aces
  A pair of kings
  Ace king suited Counter-strategy: fold every time. If no one has raised in front of you, then you play a little bit looser. You're going to go all in with any pair, any suited connector bigger than 34 suited, and ace - little card suited, and any ace king. Here, we can talk a little bit. The range recommended by Sklansky, 22+, 45s+, A2s+, AKo is 13.12% of the total number of combinations. To be at least flip against this range, you need... well... the same range. To win more than 50% of the time, we go back to range building, by trial and error. My rule of thumb here, when building ranges against a defined range, is to begin with a range that is half the given one. So, we'll take 13.12/2 = 6.56% of the entire range, which is: 88+, A-10s+, KJs+, AQo+ Against his range, you have 58.61% equity.  But I am not satisfied. 58% is too low to take against a mechanical, known strategy. So, we'll refine the initial range a little more. Let's get rid of the Kx hands, because we can get into a domination situation, with us on the wrong side. Our refined range #1 will be: 88+, A-10s+, AQo+ Which is 6.18% and which gives us exactly 60% equity. How much you want to refine this range is up to you. In the end, it will be an optimum between the pre-flop equity and the actual number of times that you get your cards and he shoves. I hope it helped. Good luck!"
"Why is ""Let There Be Range"" so expensive ? Is it worth that money?","For a serious poker book, this isn't the most expensive I've seen. Shootaa (Reid Young) has a book out for around $5k and when it came out it honestly may have been worth the price. The fact is that these tips will allow you to improve your game so much that you'll make more than the price of book in a relatively short period of time. Granted, this is assuming you're already a mid-high stakes player (or for the case of this book, small-mid stakes). Previously, and this is probably still the case but I've stopped playing because of Black Friday, the best ways to learn were to watch training videos, learn through forums such as this one, and discuss hands with players who are better than yourself. If you still have a lot to learn, books like these may not help you much. But at the end of the day if you're struggling at 100nl with a 2bb/100 winrate, this sort of book could potentially help you quite a bit. I confess that I have no knowledge of the book you've mentioned but decided to answer the more general question of why poker books can be so expensive. Another poster mentioned that books from well known (and he would argue, more credible) poker pros are much cheaper. The fact of the matter is that these books are  a) severely outdated
b) written mostly by live players who have little to no experience playing online
c) written by players who are famous and not necessarily skilled   Doyle Brunson is obviously a great poker player; however, I'd much sooner take the advice of a winning 400nl reg than him when it comes to online (and possibly live, but that's another argument) games. "
"Which requires more skill, cash game or tournament poker?","Disclaimer:  I am a cash game player, so you might consider my opinion to be biased. Cash games tend to run deeper than tournaments.  This in turn leads to more post flop play in cash games than in tournaments, as a general rule. Post flop play in a deep cash game, even one that is only 100 BBs deep, can be very difficult.  Given that we play against players with short stacks as well as deep stacks, we still need to have all the skill sets used in tournament play when playing cash, but cash players need to have additional skills that tournament players generally don't -- they need to be able to play 3 streets of post flop poker. Therefore, as a general rule -- and I know that I'm opening myself up to a ton of criticism here -- it takes more skill to play cash than it does to play tournaments.  There are simply more decisions that are easier to get wrong in cash than in tournaments."
What are the actual odds of being dealt pocket Aces?,"The odds of getting aces do not at all depend on the number of cards remaining in the deck. They depend solely on the number of cards in the deck (52), how many aces are in the deck (4), and how many cards you receive from that deck (2 in holdem). You have a 4 in 52 (or 1 in 13) chance to get an initial ace.  If you get that first ace, you then have a 3 in 51 (or 1 in 17) chance to get a second ace.  That's 1 in (13 * 17) or 1/221 chance of getting pocket aces. Your math implies that you know that the other players at your table are getting cards but are not being dealt any of the aces. For example, in your first example which says ""(4/52)x(3/50) = .46% or 1/217"" you are saying (with your 3/50 value) that a non-ace card has somehow been removed from the deck and been given to your heads-up opponent. In fact there are 51 cards whose identities are unknown to you, and you are getting one of those 51 cards. The fact that one of those unknown cards is now in the possession of your opponent isn't important. Using 50 in the denominator there is incorrect. If you have information about what kinds of cards your opponents hold, then it would be appropriate to include that in your odds calculation, but since you don't, you can't. If you know that the other players aren't getting any aces but you are, then I recommend you tip your dealer."
Studying poker math - is it worth it?,"In the big scheme of things at the poker table there are upsides and downsides to math, as well as with intuitive play. For the sack of clarity, generally speaking intuitive play is doing what you feel is right, and mathematical play is what you figure out is right based on a range of factors. Neither is a strategy, they are how you approach the game. The nature of an approach that is based on intuition is that one’s approach is based on estimate. Estimates by their nature are not facts, they are variants of the fact. In other words one is making a guess. Math in sharp contrast, is based on fact. All math is based on the one universal truth of 1 or 0, it either is or is not. This is absolute, no variance, no maybe, there is always the same particular conclusion for any particular problem involving math. The reality is math predicates on intuition, math can be replaced by intuition (and should be) and calculators always give up tells. Using math at the table, even if it always brings you to the right conclusion, always introduces error. It is akin to going through a related list of things were modification of anything changes everything and invalidates the list. You cannot ever get through the list, so whatever was concluded is in error. At extremes, neither approach to the game can be optimal. The context of each depends on the context of the other. If all one understands about poker is the math of the game, one will not have a grasp of when to apply that math. If all one understands about poker is when they have the best of it, one will not have a clue what to do with that knowledge. No one of course is absolutely clueless. The perfect poker player has perfect intuition and is always playing accordingly. The perfect poker player is not thinking in mathematical terms. The perfect poker player would have already absorbed all the math, all the poker theory and boiled it down to intuition. It is simply saying that the more experience you have at the table, the more work you have done understanding the math, the better your guess is going to be. Of course no one is perfect. The OP’s question is to general to answer. I will say there is no good reason to have your math right all the time accept it can help your bottom line. However making sure that the math is right all the time may hurt your bottom line. Look at the math as part of understanding the game and improving your intuition. Both intuition and math are dependent on the quality of the other."
Is there an optimum formula for deciding chip denominations?,"Here are some considerations for denomination choice: (1) justifies keeping a small number of large-denomination chips; (2) and (3) justify using many denominations; (4) justifies using few denominations; and (5) justifies small gaps between denominations. ""Optimal"" is going to depend on (a) your priorities with respect to the above and (b) the distribution of bet and pot sizes. Without enumerating the chip combinations for the entire bet distribution, let's try it for 10 big blinds, which is a medium-large average pot size in No Limit Holdem: The left column is clearly superior to the middle, using fewer chips per denomination on average and forming more bets. The last column is easiest to count and has the same total chip average as the first column (6x2 = 4x3). Since we don't have data on bet and pot size frequency, we can't be much more thorough, and as shown multiple combinations are valid depending on your needs. Two or three small denominations and, if necessary, one ""supply"" denomination give us: None of the other combinations seem attractive unless you have an unusual chip supply. I would go with {1, 5, 20}, and if you happen to be short on smaller denominations, {1, 2, 5}, {1, 2, 10}, {1, 2, 5, 10}, and {1, 2, 5, 20} are decent alternatives."
Online vs Live problem,"Try playing some of the $4 buyin and/or $10 buyin online games. Those stakes often play much more similar to live $1/$2 than the $100 and $200 buyin games.  The issue is that a lot of recreational/gambler players go to the lowest stakes offered. In live casinos, that is typically $1/$2. Online, much lower stakes are offered. As such, the average opponent you face at the comparatively higher stakes of $1/$2 online will be much more skilled than the average opponent you face at the same stakes in a live casino. Many things you do to correctly play against moderately skilled opponents will fail against rank amateurs."
Set Mining: betting pre flop with 22+,"Using PP's solely to flop sets isn't a winning strategy.   (note: I'll stick to talking about open-betting pre-flop and not cold-calling which 
leads to similar post-flop situations, but infers different ranges for all players 
involved. Also, I consider small PP's 22-88; mid PP's 99-TT; and big PP's to 
be JJ-AA. JJ is a special case. Closer to being a mid PP IMO, as I find it's 
commonly misplayed and is often better considered more like 88, 99, TT than it 
is QQ, KK, and AA.) In short: Think, ""Are our Implied Odds (IO) favourable?"" and ""Will we have enough Fold Equity 
(FE) later in the hand?"". Playing with this in mind with marginal equity, yet high 
potential hands like PP's is good due to commonly having high IO whilst having low 
FE, and vice versa. If your level of post-flop skill is such that flopping sets is how you plan to make 
money with PP's then it's likely that you'll be missing a ton of value, if not 
losing with them. That said, these will be some of your most profitable hands if played correctly, 
shorthanded or full ring. To that end, improving your hand-reading will help you play those PP's 
best when you only have one pair, a draw or thin value to bet with instead of the monsters that you're already comfortable with. Long version: As a starting point, your odds of hitting a set on the flop with a pocket pair is  around ~7.5 to 1 or ~11.8%. That is... ...represents your chance of not hitting a set on each sequential community flop 
card subtracted from 1 to get the overall chance that you do hit a set within 3 
cards. You can continue this until the river to get ~19.22% or ~4.2 to 1 of hitting 
a set. Generally, mid to large PP's 99-AA are likely profitable from anywhere due to their underlying strength. They have all the advantages of small PP's, plus the addition of better showdown value. Specifically, opening a small pocket pair from any position should be 
considered with regard to just a few important things: In detail: Small PP's (22-88) play better against the extremes of player types. Namely tight 
and weak, or loose and aggressive. This should affect whether you decide to 
open these hands in the first place. Generally, the more numerous and aggressive 
pre-flop the opponents left to act are, the less inclined you should be to open. 
Consider folding more often in that case. And vice-versa. Tight-Weak opponents will play a range that will give you lots of action with overpairs, TPTK and strong draw type hands, or just give up very easily vs mild aggression the times when you have air or marginal equity and they have the same. Loose-Aggressive opponents will play a range that is wide and weak that will commonly bluff repeatedly and also allow you to get greater value with your marginal hands, the times when you don't have a set. They'll also react aggressively when you bet into them. Both are typically what you'd 
consider good IO situations. The middle ground between these extremes is more difficult to navigate as you'll often (~7.5 to 1 against flopping a set!) not have much equity and will commonly lose at showdown if you get there. With regard to your image, how aggressive you are, and your likely range should 
(but not always, depending on opponent adjustments) dramatically alter how 
profitable you are pre- and post-flop with PP's. Depending on the players left to 
act, opening from EP and MP with small PP's (22-66) will be more difficult when you have 
aggressive, shortstacked or combinations of those types of players behind, as they 
can price you out of your implied odds. Considering whether players cold-call, 3bet, squeeze, float post-flop cbets, etc. against you should make you consider tightening or loosening your opening standards. The simplest example would be opponents who are IP on you. Opening is less attractive with aggressive opponents yet to act. Conversely, if you have weak, tight and passive opponents who fold too much and/or allow you free passage to hit your strong equity hands at favourable odds, then opening small PP's becomes a better prospect. I hope that helps. :)"
Did I play QQ correctly in this situation?,"On the flop you should make it like $20-$25. Really small, because realistically villain never has any good hands (I think he should fold 88 and slowplay aces and kings only rarely). Villain will be put into a tougher spot. You allow him to float / get crazy with all his weak holdings. He minraises you and it is just a stupid spot. Given the fact that he had eights in this spot and min-raised like this, tells me he probably is a fish. And they are the most unpredictable players. This is such an onorthodox move by him, it comes down to a read. Because he is a fish I wouldn't quickly discount eights. He could also have aces or kings from time to time. Would he make this move with a set or a strong overpair? Would he do it with T9 with a backdoor flush draw? With JJ, TT? It is really hard to say.  However, just like Ying Li said, you shouldn't shove. It makes his life very easy. If he is looking to stack off with JJ-99 he will still do this on most turn cards. If he has a bluff, you allow him to continue bluffing or maybe he shuts down and you likely win at showdown. It really depends on the fish I am playing against, but I think I would setup my range like this: call with eights and nearly every overpair on the flop. Then stack off on the turn with eights, aces and possibly kings. If you think he is capable of making really crazy plays and you have a tight image, maybe include queens and jacks. It is a close spot. Against normal players you should definitely stack off being this short (against a call or a normal raise). But in this spot I think calling the flop and hero folding the turn is right."
Daily profit - how much do you consider enough [NLHE NL2],"Your question is slightly all over the place but I'll try to answer it the best I can. First, it seems like you've fallen prey to a common mindset issue many, mostly recreational, poker players have. You shouldn't be measuring your results by what you're currently up or down during one session. You'd be surprised to learn that winning players are really only going to have winning cash sessions something like ~55% of the time over the long run. As such, you shouldn't be focusing on the current results of your session, you should be focusing on the quality of your play, your current mindset, how tilted you are, and so on. Cash players measure their results in something called big bets per 100 hands or BB/100. A big bet is simply two times the big blind. So in $0.01/$0.02 micro-stakes cash, a big bet is $0.04. So when a player says they are an 8BB/100 winner at $0.01/$0.02, you know that, on average, for every 100 hands (normally about an hour worth of play) they put in at a $0.01/$0.02 table, they will make $0.32.  Note that isn't that much. And that's what winning players are making. If you're a slightly profitable, or breakeven player, then over the long run you'll make much less per hour. So when you're sitting at a $0.01/$0.02 table, you shouldn't be worrying about what you're currently up or down. That piece of information is completely irrelevant. It doesn't help you play better poker. For most people, it will usually tend to put them on tilt. For instance: And so on. The point here is that one of the most significant things you can do for yourself as a poker player will be to stop focusing on short-term results. Poker is a game where the profit shows up in the long run. So when you sit down for a cash session, know before you start how long you want to play for. Set concrete time limits. For instance, I strictly play 60 minute sessions of heads-up hyper-turbos on PokerStars. No more, no less. Then I take a break, evaluate my hands, and do another session if I'm feeling up to it. And then be honest with yourself during your play. If you know you get tilted if you lose 2-3 buy-ins, set a stoploss. For instance, lots of cash players will quit the game entirely for the day if they're down three buy-ins, simply because they know they won't be able to play their best. And even if you aren't down three buy-ins, but you know you are tilted, or tired, or just playing badly, leave. Quit.  The idea is to put in quality volume. Leaving a cash table when you are playing your best and are in the zone simply because you've won money is a bad, bad idea. You need to capitalize on when you're playing your best. Don't say you'll leave after you gain/lose this much, say I'm going to play 60 minutes of $0.01/$0.02 and try to make the best possible decisions I can, regardless of the outcomes. 1) Are NL2 micros for building your bankroll to move on higher stakes rather for money winning purpose ? Honestly, all micro-stakes games aren't going to give you a good hourly rate, even if you're in the top 1% of players. Micro-stakes games are for building a bankroll while you're learning how to play. Consider this. Every single person that decides to play poker will have to pay $$$ for their poker education. Lots of new players will be losing players for some time before they become skilled enough to win consistently. So at what stakes do you want to pay for your poker education? Micro-stakes $0.01/$0.02 or mid-stakes $2/$5? Obviously micro-stakes. Just keep in mind that the focus when you're playing micro-stakes should be on learning and improving instead of grinding out volume. Review your hand histories, watch videos, and so on. This will pay off so much in the long run and when you move up you'll be well prepared to crush. 2) What do you consider enough for a starter trying to practice his book theory ? playing tons of hands per-day or winning that much or get out when you bored / tired / distracted etc. ? Put in as much quality volume and quality study/review as you can per day. If you know you're tilted/tired, stop playing and study/review. Do NOT fall prey to the tendency all new poker players have to become an autopiloting grinder at micro-stakes. This is basically poker purgatory. It's far more important to play, say, 2-4 tables of cash while focusing on making good reads and decisions instead of mindlessly grinding 16 tables. So, so many people, myself included, have made this mistake.  Also consider buying Jared Tendler's Mental Game of Poker. It's considered the best book on managing poker tilt out there."
Determining the proper play on the turn,"I think the biggest mistake here is not raising pre-flop. With three people in the hand and AQ out of position I think this has to be a raise, relating to some comments that I read I would be raising here 100% of the time, I don't think playing AQ out of position is great (obviously you play it, it's a monster) and so narrowing the field would be the first thought in my head. After that I would have to agree with the re-raise on the flop but it is worth bearing in mind that once the big blind calls the cut-offs range is still pretty wide as they are getting pretty good odds to call (although there aren't too many draws out there). The call from the BB should tighten their range quite a bit though (maybe Ax or a set or something), really they shouldn't be calling with any draws here.  I think when the second 7 comes down it is a bit of a brick really, it's not changing anything at all (the only hands it helps are ones that are already ahead of you and it just makes them slightly likely). I think that betting out here is definitely the best strategy and based on stack sizes probably an all in shove, although somewhere in the region of 5-6k would do the job as well. I would say that not raising pre-flop and not raising on the turn would be big mistakes here. "
Outs counting correction,"You can't adjust the ""outs"" because you don't have enough information (that's what poker is, a game of incomplete information) but that's perfectly ok because the outs themselves do mean absolutely nothing. If I tell you, you have 16 outs to win... are you ahead or are you most likely dead? You don't know, 16 outs means you're ahead in the flop but you're not in the river and you're definitevely drawing dead in the national lotery... with the same outs. We're so familiar with counting outs that we forget about the implicit information: the game and the street. What's really important though it's the odds of winning and that DOES take into account the already dealt cards. The theory, summarazing, is that the probability of an event doesn't get affected by unknown factors (let me clarify this, it doesn't get affected as long as you include those unknown factors into the total number of possible events). That way, if you have a flush draw in the flop you have 9 outs (to simplify we'll assume it's a nut flash draw as if you're in a 5 way flop and you're counting you're 2-5 as a winner you need to revise your strategy), there're 9 cards that will help you but to calculate the odds of you winning you multiply that by four and you get the magic number of 36%. But how did you came up with that number?? What you really did was (by means of a simple rule that gives approximate results) was the probability of getting one of those cards by taking 2 random cards out of a deck of 47 cards, 47! That 47 magic number is the key, in a 6-max table the actual number of cards left in the deck is 37, as ten other cards have been dealt to the other players but to calculate the odds you're including that as if those cards were still in the deck and the effect is exactly the same. You could calculate it as: The second formula is equivalent to the first (produces the same results) but it's harder to calculate so we use the first. The main point is those dealt hand are taken into account by the fact that when you calculate the odds you count the deck as having all the cards except the ones in the flop and in your hand, that's equivalent as including the dealt cards to the other players, those cards are unknown and so it's as if they were still on the deck. Of course one thing that DO change the odds is the way the hand has been played."
NL100: Facing River Raise After Flopping Straight,"The guy just filled up, so this is a fold IMO. His range to do this on the river seems to be pure value or overvaluing a 9 putting you on a over pair. But i aspect a check-call with most 9s such as J9 or a raise somewhere in the hand as he would be open-ended. The way this played and without more information I fold, as I expect to see 89 and 9T."
"Ax2x, UTG, final tabler, 4 players. Go to war?","You don't mention how big are the blinds, but you say ""Hero calls 8000"", so I'm assuming the blinds are 4K / 8K, which means you have about 7 BB behind. This means you're SEVERELY short stacked. In this case, the play for you is pretty much on automatic pilot: find a decent hand to go all-in with. I disagree with what you did preflop: you should've moved all-in or folded. Limping when you're that short stacked is a weak play in my book. The fact that there are only 4 players left makes this even worse (because it costs A LOT to play 1 round). Your think process was probably: I'll limp and hope I'll hit the flop. My opponent(s) will hopefully
  hit the flop too. So maybe I can extract maximum value this way. Although this can work perfectly if you do connect with the board, the chances of this happening are pretty low, which is why it's a much better idea to go all-in or fold, not something in between. Your play on the flop was actually not bad at all. The guy in the BB saw that you're short stacked (and made a mistake preflop :D), so he made a bet. You figured he would do that with absolutely any 2 cards (I would :D) and you would be correct; so you decided to go with it because you were actually connected to the board. So preflop: not a good play.
On Flop: ok play. The fact that you won or lost doesn't change this."
Main differences between Limit and No Limit Hold'em,"When you move to limit, math is going to be a much bigger part of your play. You have to learn to correctly calculate pot odds and implied odds, since it is very different. You can and should read whole books on the subject of limit play, because it is very different. To summarize the MAJOR points that change. Open ended straights on the flop on multi-way pots become much more favorable to call down to the river with. Check raising a the turn can be a very profitable play and can help disguise your play. Earning a single BB more or saving a single BB makes a HUGE difference over time. Small mistakes have big consequences.  Many times the correct play is only a few percentage points better on the positive EV."
Is it ever ok to limp preflop? Beginner question,"Generally, I would strongly advice against limping. It is a bad strategy. There are some very specific spots were limping might be reasonable, but always raising pre-flop is never wrong. There is a reason limping is considered a weak play. The biggest advantage of always raising pre-flop is that it allows you to pick up the blinds and perhaps the antes uncontested. This is a big win. Poker isn't about seeing flops and hitting hands, it is about getting chips. Raising puts you into a position to do so. Another advantage of raising pre-flop is that you can put your opponent on more specific ranges. If you raise pre-flop, your opponents have to be tighter calling and 3-betting, than if you had limped. Furthermore, raising allows you to play bigger pots with your premium hands. And last but not least, this is a balanced strategy. You will be raising with both your very good and marginal hands, making it tougher to play against you. Now onto always limping. Same things can be said, but in the opposite way. Limping will cause you to never pick up any chips uncontested. Your opponents will have wider ranges, making it tough for you to play against them and you won't be playing big pots with your premiums. The only advantage I can think of is that limping will occasionally save you some money with your weaker holdings. Now a mixed strategy of both. You can chose to raise up, and play big pots with your premium hands and limp with your weak hands. This seems good, but this strategy isn't balanced. Once your opponents have figured out what you are doing, you are too easy to play against. To make this strategy work you would have to sacrifice a lot of premium hands into your limping range, but you will less often take down the pot pre-flop or play big pots. Ultimately this strategy will be less profitable in the long run."
"Is there a rule variation where only a single high card (not 2nd,3rd etc.) is used to resolve 2 flush hands?","There isn't a special ranking rule for flushes. The winning hand is always the best five cards out of the seven available. The two hole cards plus the five community cards. My guess is that player 1 just didn't want to lose. So he made up this rule to get what he wants. Again, this is just an educated guess. I've been playing poker for years and I've never heard of such a rule. There are no variations of Texas Hold'em that would allow this, as far as I know. Of course, in a home game, everyone is free to make up their own rules, in which case all players should be aware of them and follow them. In this case player 2 wins the hand, since he holds the Q♠ producing the better and therefore winning hand.  K♠ Q♠ 7♠ 4♠ 3♠ beats K♠ 7♠ 4♠ 3♠ 2♠"
Does This Qualify As A Split Pot?,"It's a split. In short, the best 5 card hand that you can make wins. In this case, you're both playing the board. There is a similar question here, What is the“Top Five Cards” rule and how does it apply to splitting pots?, explaining the scenario in more detail."
How to play QQ live tournament?,"My first impression is there's not much wrong with the hand, if anything at all. A reasonable case for 3-betting Preflop can be made, but that depends on the type of players behind you left to act. I'm more inclined to 3-Bet if they are mostly Loose-Passive. Clearly, you have what most people consider a ""Value"" hand in this situation. From the looks of it, you seem to have around T$8000 in your stack preflop, your flop bet is about 1/2 - 2/3rds pot(?) which seems normal and a fair play. At the turn, you size the bet about T$2000 into a T$7500 pot. If I'm right then assuming the turn was a blank non-scary card, the sizing looks fine with the intention of moving all-in at the river, whatever the card. It's just an unfortunate hand. IMO no-one, including the villain did anything wrong. It's likely it's a reciprocal situation, i.e. Villain would lose in the same manner if the roles were reversed. Unlucky on this one, better luck next time. :)"
99 short stacks reraised under the gun tournament,"I can't see calling here for an additional 1800 to get to 3000 with then only about 4000 left. So to me it leaves shoving all-in or folding. If you shove, I think you have near zero fold equity after the PF3B to 3000 done by the solid/conservative player you describe at UTG+1.  He already did put 3000 in and he'd have only 4000 to add to call in a pot that would have, before his call, 10750 (your 7 000 + 6*25 of ante + 600 of blinds + his 3 000)... So he would have quite good calling odds if you were to PF4B shove all-in. So if you shove, you have to seriously expect a call.  Which leaves you to putting him on a PF3B range, to see if your 99 could be a favorite vs his range. Versus a range of nearly 5%, which would be 77+,AK (all pocket pairs of 77 or more and all AK hands), you are only 41% favorite. To reach 50/50 he would need to have a range of 7% (say 55+,AK,AQ). So to me you don't have enough fold equity and if you want to ""flip"", I'm really not sure it's going to end up being a flip, because a solid/conservative player 3-betting you preflop from UTG+1 (4 players are still going to speak after him) must have a narrow range. So, as ""amigal"" answered in the other answer, I think fold is a good idea : )"
"Is it rude to cash out when ahead, then buy back in?","Yes it's rude, or rather many players will consider it rude. However you're playing I assuming to make money and not friends, so if you want to cash out and buy-in again that's your business. However many card rooms will have policies that forbid this, as effectively you're taking cash off the table, which they tend to not like. The wording of these type of policies tend to be something like a player cannot remove chips or cash from the table while still actively playing. If your card room doesn't like players removing chips from play, then a way around this is to get up, take a break and request a new table. As a side point, as mentioned by @Paparazzi, having a big stack is a great situation to be in, and the crux of your problem sounds like you are entering to many pots and not playing big stack poker correctly."

What should a new player memorize?,"The first thing to learn is some basic hand requirements, sorted by position. Say, you've been dealt Q♥J♠ and since it's face cards it should be good to play no matter what. No! You need to memorize (and do it quickly) your relative position to the BTN (dealer) and play these cards according to your current position. A flush is stronger than straight. Don't try to get all-in with Q♣J♣ if the board looks like 4♥K♥5♥9♥T♠ Memorize the order. You're going to memorize hands that can be played in first positions (UTG,UTG+1), the same cards and some more on middle position (MP,MP+1) and the rest of playable cards in later positions. The biggest damage (overtime) is not to lose a hand, but to play a hand you should have folded. Cash games, regardless the level is all about position. Say have A♠A♥ preflop. You're going to open-raise or re-raise another raiser or shove another raiser who did raised the initial raiser. This is basic to memorize; Try to place all your money before the flop. Simple. If the flop comes, you follow another approach since you have just a pair, yet the strongest one. But still a pair. Memorize it, don't fall into the illusion (or love) you hold the strongest hand after the flop. People in these stakes like to slow-play (that is, play slowly AA/KK etc.), then busted by a million ways. Try to see a cheap flops eg. by paying 5,6 BB at most by just limping / calling a small raise, for the purpose of hit your set, for example: Having 4♠4♥ on 4♣9⋄A♠ Gotcha! you're going to win a nice pot if the initial raiser has an A If an opponent continues his aggression, betting and betting again, just believe him. In these stakes bluffing is not really that popular. Just stay out of trouble. Memorize to not giving in your ego. Just fold that hand. Plenty of chances to come. Memorize this simple, yet profitable move. This is a bet on the flop you're making, regardless if you made a hand or not. Most of the time your opponents will fold. Since your opponents are looking into you on how much you're cbetting try to confuse them by that very typical bet. Just do it. It's profitable. If you're not doing it, your opponents will know whether you have a hand or not. These position (SB and BB) are the very worst in NLHE, not only you're first to act for 3 streets (flop,turn,river), but you're forced to give money for any heck hand you dealt. Memorize you should most often than not fold in these positions. Statistically, you're going to lose money from these positions no matter good you are. Do not overplay them, you just have no position eg. always acting first, thus knowing nothing about opponents hands. Until you're more experienced, just try to avoid them and
 - play only your monsters hands from there 
 - raise more than usual to overcome your positional disadvantage On NLHE you're raising in what is called Blinds (BB). If you're first to act, raise 3 blinds to start. If another has limped before you eg. just called, increase by +1 BB your open-raise. Just avoid them as a starter. This concept is for experienced players who know how to play, especially after the flop. You may heard that you should 3-bet but in micro-stakes isn't really necessary. But it's a nice way to lose a lot of stack eg. having T♥T♠ and flop comes A♠K♥3⋄. You're toast most of the times. Just avoid them will save you the money. Try to be aggressive with your best of the best cards. All the above is pretty basic and you'll find most players are following them. Although you asked for something to memorize, you'll find that most things to memorize in poker have nothing to do with numbers, merely with a typical approach before dive into more exotic strategies.

Standing of all-in losers in a tournament,It is determined by their stack size prior to the hand starting.
NL400: Big Slick IP vs C-Bet In 3-Bet Pot,"I think SoboLAN gave a lot of great analysis in his answer. There are two major things that I have to add: With 10 outs, we have about 35% equity against most of our opponent's range (excluding, obviously, the hands that we are already ahead of). That's nothing to sneeze at. If there were no more money behind, we could expect a positive return on calling a pot-sized bet. Looking at our opponent's stats, I have to guess that he's 3-betting around 12% in this kind of button-vs-blinds situation. That's a little bit tighter than any-pair-and-any-broadway. With his aggression factor, I do think that he is going to c-bet almost every board he 3-bets, regardless of how well it hits his hand. The bet-sizing itself doesn't tell us much, but it makes me slightly inclined to he wants a fold. Against that entire 12% range, pokerstove puts us as a slight favorite here at 53%. Certainly the first hands to discount are going to be the ones that we are ahead of, but I can't see us with less than 40% equity, and I seriously doubt we are less than 45%. Given that, to me, it seems like a crime to fold. I know we don't have much history on this opponent, so street-by-street aggression numbers are probably pretty sparse. Still, if we have seen any indication that he is mostly aggro on the flop and slows down on the turn, then that argues for a call in my book. We can use our position and our equity in the hand to see profit from later streets. I often agree with the thought that putting in a quarter of your stack to fold later can be a bad idea, but here I think it's often going to be our best option. As above, folding gives up too much. I do think that calling with position here is +EV, even knowing that it's a large portion of our stack. The question to answer is whether calling is more +EV than raising. And that depends on how much of our opponent's range we expect to see fold. Even if we shove, he will be getting nearly 2-1 odds, so we probably get called too often for my tastes - we're certainly getting folds from the hands that we beat, but that's not really a huge win for us - we'd rather keep those hands in. That said, let's look at it. If we assume he calls a shove with 33+ and folds the other 60% of his hands, we're left with about 30% equity (given sets and whatnot). He might also call occasionally with flush draws, but I'll ignore that as it only increases our equity if it happens. That shows a net of over nearly $100. It's hard to argue that we make more than that by calling, so I shove unless we believe he is 3-betting significantly less hands than I estimate."
NL400: Vs a TAG Regular. Interesting River Decision,"If we bet here, we are doing it as a bluff. Worse hands will fold. With that in mind, what better hands can we fold out with a bet? Perhaps some Ax, but not necessarily. Therefore, we should check. Now, how about if he bets? Since we have no reads, I will assume he is playing straight-forward and will never double float us. What hands will bluff? There are no missed draws in his range, and worse hands that have gotten this far will be seeking a show-down. Therefore, we can conclude that he is only betting with better on the river. In short, I would check/fold this river."
Acting out of turn.,"Most of the time  in poker, the WSOP rules are held as canon, so keeping that in mind, this is what the 2016 WSOP rulebook has to say: So, yes, it is binding, and if done on purpose, grounds for the infringing player to be penalized."
Good Poker AUDIO Books,"I haven't tried any full-length books, but the Thinking Poker podcast is a great source of poker strategy in audio format.  They always have a good strategy segment in their weekly podcast, and they have two larger for-sale offerings of longer and more in-depth strategy that are high quality.  They're at http://www.nitcast.com/collections/all. Their podcasts are mostly non-strategy, but always have interesting poker-related content which might not directly help your game, but it'll likely make you think and smile and laugh a few times each listen."
The Importance of Mathematics in Poker,"Your premise is off here. It isn't that high level players ignore math, it's that a lot of other concepts start to become more important. The incomplete nature of the information that we are given in poker means that it will never be a purely mathematical challenge. Figuring out what flaws exist in your opponent's game and then exploiting those flaws will result in better results than an approach based purely on the math of the game can provide. As you face more advanced opponents, the importance of these types of concepts only increases. Further, as IHars mentioned, even in the heads-up arena, math doesn't solve the game, because neither player ultimately plays according to the mathematical optimum. And for the one who is best at adjusting, they will end up achieving better results than a Nash-based approach would yield."
A detailed definition of a Donk Bet,"Generally a donk bet is when a players leads out with a bet (often on the flop, but could also be turn or river) before the preflop raiser has acted (i.e. when the preflop raiser was in position relative to the now donk-bettor), as you have alluded to. To answer your specific questions: Originally the term was used to describe any bet which could be considered bad strategically/tactically, but since then it has developed into the more specific definition above.

Questionable Tournament Rule With Two Players Left,"This is false. The hand will play out as usual with the flop, turn, and river.  I'm not sure where your friend heard this or why he believed it.

Is Harrington's zones strategy still valid at the end of a MTT tournament?,The problem with with making a standard raise with an M under 5 is that you will be left with a stack that is too low if you lose the pot. If a standard raise for this tournament is 2.5BB then you are raising to 2K to open the pot. If only the big blind calls you now have a 5K pot and a stack of 6K behind. Should you decide to push all in at this point your opponent would need to call 6K to win 11K. With almost 2 to 1 odds the villain can call with a lot of hands correctly even if you are ahead at this point. Instead if you push all in right off the bat your opponents need to call 8K to win 9800. In this situation you will take down the pot uncontested a majority of the time. More importantly you are sending a message to the rest of the field that you are willing to risk it all this late in the game. If you win two of these pots uncontested now you are sitting on 11600. If this happens to move you up to 4th or 3rd in chips now you can really begin to apply pressure on the medium positions when they are in the blinds. A hidden bonus of this all in strategy is that you can earn a walk when you are in the blinds as no one wants to challenge the aggressive player for their BB if he will potentially move all in in response.
What I did was right?,"Your preflop actions look fine. You have the second best starting hand in poker, so 4betting strongly is correct. The 3-5-6 rainbow flop is coordinated, but you worrying about hands like 2-4 and 4-7 is just silly. Think about it: would you call a 4-bet preflop with this kind of hand? Probably not unless you were super deepstacked (which you didn't mention, so I assume no). On the other hand, one of your opponents might have a set, but you can't go through your poker life scared of monsters under the bed. You showed aggression preflop, so c-betting is normal and customary.  The board pairing on the turn doesn't change anything. Either you're still ahead or you're still behind. Bet again. You don't mention stack sizes, so it's hard to evaluate shoving the river. That said, your reasons seem suspect. In poker you should be betting to either get Value or as a Bluff. These are the two primary (and I would argue only reasons) that you should be betting. What are you trying to get value from by shoving here? What better hands are you trying to get to fold? A reasonable line on the river would be check-call to induce a bluff. [and btw, the hand your opponent turned over is irrelevant to how you played the hand. In the future, don't post it.]"
Start playing NL Hold'em or Limit Hold'em?,"First, it really depends on who/where you're playing.  If you're playing with at least pseudo-serious people, I think limit is the best way to start. An often unappreciated skill in Hold'Em (and poker in general) is the ability to bet.  If you read any reputable book on necessary poker skills it will always contain a section on proper betting.  Knowing how much to bet is just as important (if not moreso) as knowing when to bet. While it may seem counter-intuitive, limit Hold'Em can really help you identify and develop this ability.  Being able to make a strong bet that's not a limit bet can say a lot.   Additionally, playing limit will help you develop the patience that is required to play Hold'Em seriously.  You won't be able to just go ""All in"" every hand, so you will learn to be meticulous with your hands and really employ and practice the other skills necessary, e.g. reading others bets, playing your position, calculating odds, etc.   I think the best reason, however, for you to start with limit Hold'Em, is you're mitigating your risk of losing a lot of money.  Don't get me wrong, you can still lose a lot of money, but you're protected from calling someone's ""all-in"" with a board two-pair when you think your straight is going to hold up :P"
"How does one combat ""casual"" gameplay habits in ""professional"" games?","Strategy itself is a fluid thing, and although the flow of a game and the effective strategy to beat it will constantly change, the fundamentals of good strategy don't. Wherever you play poker, it's still the same game, play money or real money! Simply put, if you let the type of game interfere with what you believe/know to be an effective strategy, then that's a weakness. Depending on your motives for playing poker, it's only detrimental to your skill set if you're letting obviously bad play, when engaged in play-money poker, become a habitualised part of your game when playing for real money. Essentially, What you are today you are now becoming! If your aspirations are to improve your skill, then make the decision to play your best, most effective strategy everywhere, every time, all the time! Rather than seek to conceptually separate the two games strategically, try to think of good strategy being something that moves on a single sliding scale, perhaps a loop. To illustrate, Johnny Chan once said, simplifying his strategy, ""When they are tight, i'm loose. When they are loose, i'm tight!"". I would suggest it would be better to attempt to understand each (Game|Player|Hand) on it's own merits and combine your understanding of strategy into one fluid, adaptable understanding, which is applicable wherever you play. Of course, how serious you take applying yourself in any game is your decision."
Starting a Friendly Poker Ring,"My suggestion based off my own personal experience with house games is start with small buy-in tournaments. As the experience and comfort level grows, you can then either. Up the buy-in of the tournaments and/or transition into cash games. You can set the Buy-in caps of the cash games to limit the loss and keep the games friendly. To keep players from getting bored. If they get knocked out early, we usually allow rebuys up to a certain level. We started off with $5 buy-in tournys and eventually worked our way up to a nice $100, deep stack tourney with 20 minute blinds. "
Interesting Spot in Penny Poker: Overpair vs Nit on Wet Board,"Assuming the opponent is a competent player, hero is over 200bb deep with this guy thus, I would imagine that the villain calling range is somewhat wider than at first glance. I'd think this would include all pairs (22-QQ, 3-betting KK+), almost all suited connectors (23s-KQs, 3-betting AKs), some S1C's (46s-AQs), perhaps some S2C's (K9s, Q9s), quite a few Axs. Probably around 16% of hands call preflop, occasionally including some of the 3-betting range. IMO, flop play is standard although it's likely I'll c-bet closer to $0.30. I disagree with the turn check as more often than not, I'd bet again, for value. Depending on my knowledge of this players tendencies to use various cards to bluff with (knowing he's an aggro AF: 7) if I felt it was more likely that he'd bluff or thin-value bet two streets with a worse hand rather than check-back or raise my turn c-bet, then I'd often check-call. I'd call a turn bet or raise (depending on my own action of course) and most often bet-decide river or less often c/c a river bet on an uncoordinated card. It would be very important to me to know whether this player was capable of thin value betting/bluff-raising as I'd put a lot of significance on that info when deciding to call turn or river bets. Missing the turn c-bet has obscured villains range somewhat and makes heros decision much harder IMO. The types of 2 pairs available are few as only 8♠7♠, 8♥7♥ or 8♠6♠, 8♥6♥ or 7♠6♠, 7♥6♥ are possible. Only 6 combos. Sets are of course possible, but given this guys AF I'd assume he'd play them much stronger, earlier. A total of 12 combos but I'm discounting them. That leaves straights and flushes. 5♠4♠, 5♥4♥, or T♠9♠, T♥9♥. I'm discounting 95x almost entirely. Just 4 combos, and maybe 10 combos or so of likely flushes. Obviously he might have spiked a Kx. Again, I'd need to have a read on his thin value betting tendencies to predict his actions on that river card. Getting to a possible showdown this way, I call. Putting it all together... heros turn check, added to villains aggression keeps the opponents range wide enough to have a lot of bluffs in it. Well over the 30 or so value hands villain has (or so I believe!). You're not repping a flush, nor the Kx, which incidentally is a good card for him to bluff. Thus, you look weak, he is aggressive. Your pot odds are around 3:1 if I added correctly. GTO wise, I'd say hero is well within the top 75% of hands he gets to river with in this way accounting for pot odds. If you fold you're exploitable, and if you call you have to win about 25% of the time to breakeven. I'd say hero likely has favourable odds. Again, I call. I can't say what I'd do in other scenarios as we didn't play it those ways."
Minimum number of hands required to establish a conclusion about win-rate?,"You can´t be certain just from bb/hand value, if you are winning because of skill or long upswing. There surely isn´t any magic number of hands, which makes you certain about your actual winrate, the only thing we can measure is, how propable is your winrate in certain range.  This calculation depends HEAVILY on the game you play, and also on your playstyle. Some rock with <10% vpip doesnt have to face variance as 60%/50% VPIP/PFR LAG.

How much should I be tipping when I cash a live tournament?,"From my experience as a dealer when closing out a tournament, the player whom ended up winning would give the 'loose change' from their win as a tip. I.E. say you take down a 100$ tournament in your local card room, and the top prize is something like $1,675, I've often seen players give the 75$. Normally second place would follow suit too. In bigger prize pool tournaments normally final table members would leave tips too, again often the 'loose change'. I've seen the above be true in many tournaments I've closed out from the lowest tournaments, i.e. above example, to final table of WSOP events. In my opinion, as a dealer I have never felt obliged to be tipped (granted when I was paid a rate), and whenever I was tipped I always really appreciated it. A good example of this, if you ever make it out to the WSOP one year, is the satellites games they run. You'd have your buy-in, say it's $150 (I can't remember the exact figures), the prize here would be $1k in lammers for tournament buy-ins and 100$ in cash. The dealers in satellites, and the floor staff do remind the players this, aren't paid a down rate, only hourly (which is basically all taken as tax), as such the cash prize is expected to be tipped. So in short I'd say tip the 'loose change' of the prize, if the 'loose change' of the prize isn't enough, as in say your 1st and it's something like $1,825, maybe just bump it up to $75, $100 or $125. I will also say, if you know the staff are being paid an hourly rate, I wouldn't feel so obliged to tip so heavily. One thing I often noticed in many of the places I have dealt, especially in the smaller tournaments, they often gave the 'loose change' as literal loose change. As in rather than giving 100$ bills, they give you $5s,$10s and $20s, often floors will do this to encourage players to leave tips. Not all floors, but I've had several of my floors tell me this is why they do that."
How do I calculate poker hand probabilities?,"Probabilities calculation is about a question requiring an answer. It is about a question involving: Usually, when you analyze a logical proposition, you know whether it is TRUE or FALSE. But in the case of probabilities you are analyzing multiple instances of such proposition. As an example, you can ask a true/false proposition like this: Does this world configuration bring me a 4 of a kind? AA KAAQJ >> True
  Does this world configuration bring me a 4 of a kind? AK KAAQK >> False You can notice the following traits of the question: BUT again, in probabilities, you analyze not just one single proposition but a wide proposition which covers all the possible initial state. There are two types of domains for this: In a hand-analysis question, the ultimate (reduced, in terms of computational complexity) version of the initial state is always how the deck was shuffled for this hand, and shufflings can be counted: you can establish the criterion to count shufflings. You don't have to believe me! You can test by yourself this Python code if you have access to an interpreter: This code will run over all the possible shufflings of the deck, so shufflings are enumerable (This code will take a lot! Press Ctrl+C to halt it or... wait millions of years to complete). Conclusion: Poker hand analysis belongs to the discrete probabilities domain. In the discrete domains, you enumerate the cases and apply them to the condition. You will get something like this: However, remember: you do not test each case one-by-one. You apply specific formulas to test all the case at once. So as you can tell, the answer will be a measure of cases to consider, among all possible cases, in a frequency format (given by the 0..1 returned value), calculated by given formulas we will see next. Now we will tell the formulas, the reason of being, and how and when you apply them. Please note: we will not use the stated python functions anymore, since those functions traverse all possible cases, and we are only interested in counting them, not traversing them. Shuffles Calculating possible distinct shuffles over a set is done by using factorial. Factorial is a recursive function for non-negative integers which ultimately calculates the product of a sequence of N consecutive integers. Examples: An exceptional case is 0! = 1. Factorials are not defined on negative numbers. This has a direct relationship with amount of possible shuffles, because: Permutations Calculating possible distinct permutations involves shuffling a deck and taking a certain number R of cards from it. Your deck of N cards will be shuffled like this: D1 D2 D3 D4 ... DN  And you are taking R cards, and leaving N-R cards in the deck: D1 D2 ... DR taken, D(R+1) ... DN remaining You will notice that the Python function I copied is already named permutations. This is because a full shuffling is a special case of a permutation, when we take the whole elements being shuffled into analysis. N-R cards remain in the deck. A priori this calculation is the most useful one since the R taken cards are the ones that interact creating a poker hand involving the players. It is true that I said that the ultimate case of analysis is the whole shuffled deck, but it is also true that you don't care about more than 25 cards in a hold'em table with 10 players reaching the river. So for games like this, you care only about a subset of the shuffled cards, and so the R value (amount of taken cards) is lesser than the N (number of cards in the deck) value (it can never be greater!). Take this example: just 4 cards (A, B, C, D being just the four aces) shuffled: (for this example you can run the python function to generate the samples: permutate the 'ABCD' string by 4 elements to get the following list) ABCD ABDC ACBD ACDB ADBC ADCB BACD BADC BCAD BCDA BDAC BDCA CABD CADB CBAD CBDA CDAB CDBA DABC DACB DBAC DBCA DCAB DCBA There were 24 possible shufflings. Now assume I want to know only the possible cases for the first two cards of that shuffling (iterate over each element and just calculate element[:2] on each, using a list comprehension): AB AB AC AC AD AD BA BA BC BC BD BD CA CA CB CB CD CD DA DA DB DB DC DC All of them are repeated, twice in this case. The actual cases I care about is my two cards being like this: AB AC AD BA BC BD CA CB CD DA DB DC This is when you apply permutations. You get a lot fewer cases to account for. If you notice it, the amount of duplicates for each case is, actually, the amount of possible shuffles of the cards being ignored, which is actually the shuffling of (N-R) remaining cards, or (N-R)!. Notice that ignoring duplicates could be done here because the number of duplicates or copies is always the same for each possible case, so asking AB would mean both asking: expected cases AB AB in AB AB AC AC AD AD BA BA BC BC BD BD CA CA CB CB CD CD DA DA DB DB DC DC or expected case AB in AB AC AD BA BC BD CA CB CD DA DB DC (2/24 is the same as 1/12 by simplifying or reducing the fraction) The fraction is the same value, so you can specialize the shuffles into permutations to ignore the middle step of simplifying both sides in your mind. However, in the implementation details, the formula: becomes: Since in such formula, you need to account for them being different calculations. In practice, the calculation becomes: always being R <= N. It is important to consider this: Which leads on the calculation of ... Combinations We already showed why we divide by the factorial of (N-R): to ignore possible shufflings of the remaining cards. A combination is essentialy a permutation for which we ignore its shuffling. An example of this is when we ask regarding our hole cards: we don't care in what order we receive or hole cards, but what the cards are. Assume I want to tell the cases of haing a royal flush of spades in 5 card draw (yep, the Maverick's finale hand): A K Q J T spades There is only one combination of cards I care about, but there are 120 (5!) possible permutations. Since I don't care about the possible permutations, my expected cases collapse to just one case. In Hold'Em, this just means dividing by 2. In 7-stud this means dividing by 6 (3!) for the initial cards. The calculations for combinations become: Or ... Or ... In practice, the implementation is the same as NpR but dividing the resulting value by 1*...*R. Python implementations could be like this: If you are a programmer, you can install a python interpreter (linux distribution have one by default in most cases) and test these functions with ipython, against counting the generated items by itertools.combinations and itertools.permutations. If you are not a programmer, this site helps you calculating permutations and combinations. Again: to calculate full deck shufflings, calculate a permutation with R = N = 52. Examples of usage I told you that probabilities calculation is about asking the right question, assuming the right conditions, and how those conditions can be transformed across different domains (full shufflings <-> permutations by a factor of (N-R)! and permutations <-> combinations by a factor of R!). Remember that probabilities is the expected / whole ratio in the discrete case (and expected area / whole area in continuous)? It is time to put this in practice. The best way to put it in practice is by example. So let's practice! What is the probability of getting AA in my hole cards in Texas Hold'Em? The actual card value I ask is irrelevant here! Asking about AA or KK or 22 will bring the same value What is the probability of getting a pair (and not a better hand!) in the flop? The world configuration I want, in this case, must be split in three cases: If you can notice, the spaces being analyzed is the same everytime: 2 cards combined out of 52, and 3 cards combined out of 50 (if you combine backwards, like saying 3 out of 52 and 2 out of 49, the result will be the same). Since they use all the same space, you do not need to convert them to wider spaces (in this case, the widest space not involving more cards is 52p5). The overall initial conditions amount is: 52c2 * 50c3 = 25989600 cases. Please note: For this question, which restricts to just pairs, the cards in ? cannot be the same value as X, and must also be distinct values among themselves So we need to calculate the expected cases for each space! Making a constructive analysis. For the second question example (exactly one pair, no better hand), you have three different analysis to make: Trivia If you are smart with numbers you can notice the following pattern: So always try to cross-check whether you used the right formula and assumptions. Construct for any poker game In each poker game, the received cards belong to different moments in your analysis and/or have different qualities. But such qualities depend on your question! Examples: In an analysis caring about the cards timing: So for them you will compute your space like 52c2 (hole cards) * 50c3 (flop cards) * 47 (turn) * 46 (river) overall possibilities. You can think like this: So: However, in a static analysis at the river, not counting the timing but asking about the overall table state at the end, you will have only two spaces to consider: 52c2 (hole) * 50c5 (community), because those spaces are:"
Omaha: Interesting dealer mistake at showdown,"It seems quite plain to me that the sequence of events it crucial to resolving this situation.

It also seems disingenuous that the game runner should award himself half the pot! It's dishonest. Personally, I wouldn't be playing in that game for much longer. "
Does the % of winning when someone goes all-in count cards in hands which have been folded?,"You have to realize that the majority of the taped TV shows DO NOT calculate those items in real-time. They are done days, even weeks, after the actual event in a voiceover studio, far removed from the actual games. So they have the time to calculate out those percentages and display them.  But to answer your question, yes, those percentages do take the discarded hands into account and it is reflected in the numbers you see on the screen. If you are familiar with programs like Flopzilla or Poker Cruncher, the TV people use something similar. With those programs you can put in hole cards, discarded cards and things like that and they can get accurate pot equity percentage numbers (which is what you see on the screen). "
How to size an opening raise in a NLHE tournament with antes?,"I think your question is an important one because antes is where I definitely see the most mistakes being made in a tournament.  Your thinking is along the right lines. I'm assuming your tournament will have some sort of clock available; that clock should show you the antes and blinds. This clock is your friend, always make sure you know where you're at in the tournament and know how much is in the flop including the antes. You can pick up a lot of pots pre-flop because people will think you're overbetting, but in reality its just a pot-sized bet. Keep that number rolling through the flop too, because more players underestimate the pot at this point, and size your bets accordingly. So, it's always (Ante x Players) + SB + BB. Thats already in the center before anyone does anything. But DO NOT just think about it as a pot-sized bet - in some early ante levels (and/or short-handed) that might not be enough to make the BB go away. So do the calculation above AND also figure out 3x BB and then decide which one makes sense to you. Something else to keep in mind around the antes. Most players make the mistake of playing a tourney ""backwards"" - they are too loose in early levels and too tight in late levels. So if you use appropriate pot sizing in later levels (i.e. when the antes are in play) you're very likely to improve your stack because players will be hesitant to call those ""large"" bets you're making. That's where the real advantage of knowing the antes comes into play! "
Multiple Chip Betting TDA rule 43,"I think the player at your table was misinterpreting the rule. This is a raise. Rule 43 states: a multiple-chip bet is a call if there is not one chip that can be removed and still leave at least the call amount. To me, this says that in order for it to be considered a call, there cannot exist a situation where one chip is removed and the resulting value of chips does not at least equal a call. The corollary of this is that if there does exist at least one way in which a single chip can be removed and the remainder still constitutes a call, then it is a raise. In your case, the $500 chip can be removed and the amount in play is still sufficient for a call, so the action constitutes a raise.  In the example quoted in rule 43, it states: A raises to 1200 total (an 800 raise), B puts out two 1000 chips without declaring raise. This is just a call because removing one 1000 chip leaves less than the amount to call (1200) This differs from your own example in that in Player B's case, the removal of any single chip will cause the amount to fall below the calling level.  Hence, Player B's action should be interpreted as a call. There is no way that you can remove a single chip and have the remainder be sufficient for a call. The difference is that in your case, the $500 chip could be removed and the remainder would still equal the amount required to call, and thus this action should be interpreted as a raise. Furthermore, the last sentence really seals it: If the single removal of any one chip leaves the call amount or more, the bet is governed by the 50% standard in Rule 41. This actually covers your case perfectly. The player tosses in a $1000 and a $500 chip. If you remove the $500 chip (""any one chip"") you still have at least the calling amount. Thus it's covered by rule 41. Rule 41 states that a valid raise must be at least the size of the previous bet or raise.  Because the total bet of $1500 is a valid raise ($500 more than the $1000 which was itself a raise of $500 over the original bet), the player's action should be interpreted as a raise. The rule hound at your table would have a point if your player pushed in two hypothetical $750 chips without declaring a raise. In this case, the removal of any single chip would cause the amount to fall below the calling limit, and the case would be identical in spirit to the example at the end of rule 43. This incident really underscores the importance of announcing your raises either by saying ""raise"" or declaring a number of chips that you wish to bet as you place your chips. This lowers your exposure to both angle-shooters and the overzealous busybodies that think they know the rules!"
Storing Bankroll On Poker Site(s),"If it doesn't cost you anything to withdraw or deposit (no fees), I don't see any benefit of keeping a large bankroll online. Plus it could be a form of money management by keeping a % of your bankroll on a site. If you bust and can't buy in over and over, it will force you to take a break by redepositing and hopefully getting of tilt. "
Lose money when poker server goes down?,"So typically if there is something like a server update this sort of situation won't happen (they'll just deal a ""final hand"" until the update completes). If a player gets disconnected during a hand sites typically do one of the following: So in the case of a server crash (which I think would be really, really rare) all players involved in the hand would just check the rest of the hand down (and I'll presume any bets that haven't yet been called would just be taken back). If the software can't support this scenario I guess they would just act as if that last hand never happened.  For tournaments, typically money will be refunded if the tournament is still in the early stages or the money will somehow be distributed to the remaining players in the later stages (where the distribution is either based on a chip count, ICM, or some other method)."
Should I call opponent's flop re-raise with trips?,"Given the fact that you had a 9 and there were 2 other 9's on the flop, I think it would be safe to assume that your opponent doesn't have the fourth 9. The probability of this is just very low. As it turns out, he did have the fourth 9... and it could've ended a lot worse :) . What I would do in this situation is, I would raise more on the flop, not just $60. Somewhere around $90 - $110 (maybe even more) would've been better. He had a very good hand, so he probably wouldn't have folded. But what it would do is probably prevent him from raising it so much, he would think at least for a few seconds that you have KK. Also, calling that $200 raise is not a mistake in my book. It was about 60 % of his stack, which makes it a bit obvious that he has something BIG. But, as I said, going ahead with it is not a mistake, in my opinion."
PLO100 - Top Two Facing Turn Aggression on Wet Board,"Best case here, you are up against a broadway wrap + flush draw.  Since you didn't raise pre, CO can't put you on AA, and potting twice out of position is indicative of a lot of strength, so he is not going to be raising here as a bluff.  Best case you have to dodge half the deck, worst case you're drawing thin against a set.  I fold."
Smallest Stack Size for playing 3bet/fold,"First, let's establish some parameters for what makes us pot-committed. Preflop, I like to stick with a 2-1 ratio, since the only way to be definitively more than 2-1 behind your opponent would be to know that his range is almost entirely made up of hands that have you dominated. We definitely know that this is not the case if we are short-stacked preflop. So, we know that we aren't folding if we are getting 2:1 or better. From there, it can be a math problem dependent on the size of our 3-bet. Excluding dead money from blinds/antes/etc, we will be getting 2:1 any time our 3-bet is for 1/3 of our stack or more. I'd submit then that the smallest stack size you can ever 3-bet/fold is the one where you can make a meaningful 3bet for under 1/3 of your stack. ""Meaningful"" will depend on your opponent. Opp bets 3bb, you 3bet to 7bb, and he shoves. If you have 21bb, then the effective pot at this point is 7bb from your raise + 7bb from his call + 14bb from the remaining effective stacksize in the shove = 28bb. Since it's 14bb to call and win 28bb, we must call. The same ratio will hold for any size of 3bet; if we 3bet to 8bb, we need a stack of over 24bb to fold; 9bb, we need over 27bb; etc."
Why isn't every value player rich?,"This is an interesting question.  I think a big reason why these players are not rich is because of exploitative play. Theoretically, if a player played perfect theory-optimal play then they would be able to make the most money and lose the minimum in every pot they play. This is called GTO and it is based on things like odds, ranges, combinations, and implied odds.  I think there are 2 reasons value players are not rich.  Variance exploitative play Variance simply means that sometime you will get unlucky in an uncontrollable way, even if you are playing perfectly you will run bad sometimes.  Exploitative play is more interesting. Exploitative play is when players follow lines to exploit weaknesses of other players. This is the main reason why I think not all value players are rich. No player is perfect, therefore every player can be beaten with the correct exploitative play. It is not easy to play this way especially against very good players, but there is always someone good enough to do it.  At the end of the day, poker is a very complex game with an infinite depth of strategy (reverse psychology etc.). Value players should win money, but it is impossible for them to play perfectly enough to always win (or get rich quick)."
Oregon (USA) Poker Gambling,"I'm from Portland, Oregon and play in a cardroom there about once a week. Oregon has some pretty restrictive gambling laws but in the 70's the state legislature passed a ""social gaming law"" that allowed for poker games as long as it was player dealt and the house didn't have a rake. Here's how they defined a social game in the law: They idea was that ELKs and VFW type clubs could hold poker tournaments to raise money for the club. But when Moneymaker won the main event and kicked off the poker boom a few bars in Portland started hosting tournaments to bring in customers and eventually that turned into just a dedicated poker rooms. Here's how it works: The biggest difference is that the house cannot take any money out of the pot. So everything the players pay in tournament entry fees goes back to the players. The house can only make money on the daily entry fee and selling food and drinks. Every player has to pay a one time daily fee. It used to be $10 but recently it was raised to $15. (At least at Portland Meadows where I play.) Because the law stipulates that the game must be player dealt, each dealer has to play 1 hand when they start for the day. The spend $1 and get a 25 tourney chip and just go all in on the first hand. If they double up they go all in on the next hand, etc, until they lose. Then they just deal like normal and wear a badge that reads ""Player"". Apparently that's good enough to satisfy the State. Most of the tournaments are low stakes. With rebuys and addons I've never spent more that $250 for a tournament. They are starting to have some larger buyins though of $1000. There are also ""cash"" games called shootouts which are 1 hour tournaments where the face value of the chips is equal to the dollar amount. They play just like a cash game but again since they are legally tournaments it's good enough for the State. Most of these games are $1-$2 NL but occasionally there are $2-$5 NL and $5-$10 NL and Big O has gotten popular recently.  The dealers are volunteers and don't get paid by the house. All the money they earn is from player tips, which is apparently enough for most of them to make between $20-$40 an hour. Because the money is in tips, its up to the dealers whether to declare it as wages or pay taxes on it, the house doesn't record or report on any of it. We do have legal Indian casinos in Oregon as well where poker works pretty much the same way it does everywhere else. There has been a lot of legal drama recently about whether the current system can last. Casino lobbyist groups aligned with the Indian casinos and Las Vegas casinos have been spending a lot of money recently in order to try to shut down the ""player dealt"" rooms but so far they have survived. Here is good article from Willamette Week if you want to read more about how it all works. Also if you're a watcher of YouTube this channel is pretty good and the guys are based in Portland and talk about it some times."
How would you play this?,"Pre Flop 68o has to pay 4000 to see a potential flop. In case the BB doesn't have an overpair nor a 6 or 8, he is live and has around 36%, which means his call is mathswise correct. He is up against a maximum of one player, that gives him confidence to play. In a different spot like first position he would probably fold 68o. Math:
Potsize: 7k Ante + 4k from SB and 8k from BB.
SB has to pay 4k to receive 23k, that's 1:5,75 or in percent 17.39%. After your raise to 16k the pot is now 31k
So SB has to pay 8k to receive 39k 
Which is 1: 4,875 or 20.51% so it's mathwise a call again in case he is live. Conclusion: You didn't put him on a decision, so you can't put him on any hand range, which is bad. 
So the pot after his call is 23k and if you now raise to 4 BBs it's 57k and he has to pay 24k to win 81k.
24k is already ~ 20% of his stack, which he probably won't like to lose, and since he invested only 4k he can find a fold here with live cards. He would only go for a call or raise with a big hand. non Math:
Usually a min raise is looking like a lure, so you want to have him in the pot, or you don't know the math behind poker. Here your intention is to have him in the pot.
The hard part is:
Now you can't put him on a hand, and if he starts betting you need to be scared.
In these late plays there is not much space for bluffs, since betting 3BB and continue betting with 6BB or more is already half an average stack. So getting dealt aces an no one opens the pot feels bad, but I'd prefere to push it all in pre.
In this situation the SB might think you do a move here. anyway collection all the ante safely with the call of SB is a pretty good pot on a final table.
You had 70K and on a push fold you would receive 23k which is 30% + for you.
Sounds good?
to me its good"
What are the odds of having 2 Quads in the same hand?,"Here is the maths for you. Or well my maths anyway. With 7 cards to choose from in hold'em, your hole cards and the board, the odds of making quads is about 1 in 595. (13 * (48 choose 3)) / (52 choose 7) which = 0.00168067227 or 1 in 595. This is over the entire 7 cards. So for another person to have quads in the same hand we figure out how many possible hands are left. We know the player who has quads has 4 of the same cards, 2 in his hand 2 from the board. Leaving 2 from the other players hand and 3 more from the board giving 5 cards. This leaves 1,712,304 possible hands with 5 more cards. (48 choose 5) / 5! = 1,712,304. So player one has effectively knocked out a card from the original calculation to get quads, so rather than 13 quads to choose from there is only 12 possible quads left. We can work out the odds of this player getting quads, which gives up 528 possible hands to give him quads in this situation, 12 types of quads left, 44 cards to choose from 12 * 44 = 528. So now that we know the other player has 528 possible hands to give him quads over 5 cards, and we know the total number of possible hands left to be dealt, 528 / 1,712,304 = 0.031% or 1 in 3243. This situation only factors in heads up like the above hand, and if both players have pocket pairs. It would change if the second player needed 3 cards on the board for their quads."
Specific Hand recommended action,"Your call preflop was good as you had the desired multi-way pot for set-mining. What i don't like is the donk bet against 3 opponents.
These types of bets against multiple opponents are showing great strength, exactly what you don't wish to show right now! Give the aggressor a chance to C-bet this pot and some others to call. C-bets are more easily called than the donk-bet on your side since more often than not they mean nothing and a villain holding a T or a Q will call a typical C-bet, filling a pot you're pretty sure you win. These cards belong to any calling range so you should expect at least one out there to have a piece on this flop. You were lucky that one of the villains raised you big since this is a dreamy reaction when you have a set. You don't really care if he has QQ or TT or say a high Q when you hold another set, you just have to either win everyone's stack or die in the process with a set, at least for me. Although, most of the time all you will get is a fold/fold/fold action and be sad when you donk bet, especially if it's not a usual move by you. Avoid donk bets in this situations. I would only donk-bet if the board was very coordinated, like: 5⋄T⋄Q⋄ or 5♠Q⋄J⋄ and this would be party to the flop and to the number of villains out there. Against a single opponent, i would still let him C-bet even in these flops. Even in this kind of flops, a set is extremely strong. You never fear with a set, especially in this not-so-coordinated flop, so what's the rush? In any case, you should re-raised him about 450$ (about x2.5 his bet) when he raised you to 185$. Since you're not going to fold this very strong, made hand, why giving him the free card? The guy raised you almost x4 times your bet and you want to push the rest with a set, otherwise you're just giving him a shot with whatever he has (you mostly fear a straight draw). You can never know if he had another set, a 2-pair, a straight draw or perhaps a high Q since when you have a set you only care about the flop texture and how coordinated it is and decide the tempo with good sized bets. The villain made it easy for you, so fist pump and raise him now. He isn't afraid to shovel money in it, so help him. If he has another set, you will lose anyway your whole stack now or later. But if he had a high Q or a 2-pair, you win 80% and more of the time, simply put.
Harrington says you're supposed to lose a big amount, if not your whole stack with a set but he talked about tournaments. Still, a set strength doesn't change much in cash games. The problem with your sets are how to attract all of their money to the pot. In this particularly hand you didn't had that problem. The only way to lose this hand is: As you see, there are very few cases, and pretty rare as well. Simply put, you should had go with this hand to the end. Go with EV and less with instict. Welcome to the game!"
Why Prahlad Friedman's hand called dead againist Ted Bort on WSOP 2010?,"There was a lot of controversy around that hand. I think the official explanation from the floorman and supervisor was that as soon as the floorman said ""one"" the hand was dead. He said ""hand dead"" a second later, but the time was up when the said ""one"".... I think this explanation is pretty thin. Friedman said ""call"" before the words ""hand dead"" were pronounced so he should have been allowed to make the call.  Here is a piece on Pokernews on the incident: http://www.pokernews.com/news/2010/09/the-wsop-on-espn-world-champions-november-niners-and-one-ver-8830.htm"
Play in position against BB preflop raiser,"I think by calling on the flop it makes you look like you have a weak hand, therefore the other guy might be using this to his advantage. I would have 3-bet the flop that way you know where you stand. If they call then chances are they have at least something. The line you took they could basically be playing any two as they have sensed your weakness. There are no real scare cards there for me, therefore I think you should probably have got it all in with TPTK to be honest. Did they show what they had?"
How to count the power of cards in hand?,"""Power"" of a hand is in practice an oversimplified notion. I will touch equity and your sub-question about what it says about a hand's goodness. If you're just trying to code equity, the Coding the Wheel article others have mentioned is mandatory reading for poker coders: http://www.codingthewheel.com/archives/poker-hand-evaluator-roundup As for the description of hand strength in your second paragraph, preflop equity already accounts for all streets, without considering circumstances that might prevent you from seeing those streets. Basically, calculating per-street odds is unnecessary since that information is already embedded in a preflop ""hot-and-cold"" equity. Flopzilla is a tool that sounds vaguely like what you're describing: http://www.cardrunners-ev-calculator.com/Flopzilla.html Your line of thinking - ranking a hand by its street-specific ""power"" - is similar to the function provided by ProPokerTools' equity graphs: http://www.propokertools.com/help/simulator_docs#graph These graphs show minimum equities for proportions of possible flops against a hand or range, and are often cited as evidence of a hand's playability, a concept that is particularly relevant in big bet Holdem. Much work has been done in the ranking of hands, but rankings tend to have limited usefulness in big bet games and are mostly useful for studying limit games and tournament push-fold situations: http://www.bigbetsoftware.com/holdemviewer/rankings/ (Disclosure: I am the author of the software in the above link.) The prevailing philosophy in modern big bet games, particularly in No Limit Holdem, is that hands don't have absolute preflop value and depend on situation-specific ranges and positions (except for premium hands in most cases). If your question simply boils down to charting equity, this has been done to death - you can find such a table here: http://www.pokerstove.com/blog/holdem-preflop-matchups/ This table is useful to check your calculations against if you just mean to write the code as practice. A good supplement to the Coding the Wheel article, if you're looking for algorithms to study, is this thread on hand evaluator performance: http://pokerai.org/pf3/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=16"
Insurance in cash games. In which situations is it a good idea and for how much -EV?,"Someone who never took insurance would do better in the long run than somebody who took insurance.  Ultimately it's a subjective question since you are losing EV. Only you can answer if the juice is worth it to you to reduce variance. It's easy to construct hypothetical situations in which I would take insurance in real life, given a large enough pot. That being said I have never taken it or wanted to take it at the table. Clearly there are cases in real life where taking insurance is rational, typically to insure against losses that are too difficult to replace. You shouldn't run into those cases playing poker. IMO wanting to take insurance is a sign that you're playing above your bankroll. "
What are the odds of getting the same four-of-a-kind twice in a row?,"The odds of getting a 4 of a kind given 7 cards (2 in your hand and 5 on the board) are (13 * (48 choose 3)) / (52 choose 7) or 0.00168067227. The probability of getting that specific 4 of a kind again are now (48 choose 3) / (52 choose 7) or 0.000129282482. The probability of both events occurring is 0.00168067227* 0.000129282482, which is 0.000000217281482. Note that this leaves open the possibility that other people at the table would also still have the four of a kind (as in, it includes those situations where there is a four of a kind on the board.) Presumably, you'd want to exclude those.  For this, we have to multiply the probability of getting 3 of a kind on the board while having an unpaired hand with the probability of getting 2 of a kind on the board while having a paired hand. Probability of matching 2 of a kind on the board: (48 choose 3)/(50 choose 5) Probability of no pocket pair: 1248/1326 So the probability of an exclusive four of a kind is: (48 choose 3)/(50 choose 5) * (78/1326) + (47 choose 2)/(50 choose 5) * (1248/1326) = 0.000960384154 The probability of getting the same exact four of a kind is then: Probability of matching 2 of a kind on the board: (48 choose 3)/(50 choose 5) Probability of no pocket pair that matches that 4 of a kind: 208/1326 This is: (48 choose 3)/(50 choose 5) * (6/1326) + (47 choose 2)/(50 choose 5) * (208/1326) = 0.000116969865. So the final probability is 0.000116969865 * 0.000960384154 = 0.000000112336005. So basically: 8,901,864 : 1 odds of you getting the same four of a kind assuming you are the only one with the four of a kind each time. Otherwise, 4,602,324 : 1 odds of you getting the same four of a kind twice."
Why is full house called full house?,"Before straights and flushes were added to the game in the 1860s, it was called a ""full hand"", because it was the only hand that used all five cards. The term ""full house"" came later in the 1880s, probably encouraged by the previous use of that term for a sold-out theater. I don't know of any reasonable etymology for ""full boat"", or when that was first used."
General strategy shortstacked PLO cash games,"The general strategy for Omaha is the same for playing short stacked in any poker game. Play tight aggressive. The concept is that you put your money in when you are against a large field with the best hand. Because you are short stacked, sometimes you will have situations when you get it in and can't be made to fold, and you somehow win hands you might have otherwise folded. Compare to having a large stack, where you will have to occationally fold in situations that would have won. This is the essence of the short stack advantage. So Omaha, Stud, whatever... short stack means play tight up front, and get your money in aggressively, early. If your large stack opponets play the same general strategy, you will win more often because they will occationally bet each other out of a side pot, propelling you into first place for the main pot."
Did I play this AK hand well?,"There are a lot of questions outstanding in this, but a couple of things jump out at me. AK (suited or not) is not some all-powerful hand.  There is a tendency for some players to do what is called ""falling in love with AK."" (aka the Anna Kournikova syndrome - AK looks good but barely wins).  Where once a player engages with AK, regardless of how strong or weak they are on the flop, they keep aggressively push the position.  This usually doesn't work out well.  Just sayin. I this situation, I would have either just fold after the flop (after limping in) or just called on the river.  I think that calling with over cards on the turn could be a justified play given the pot (in hopes of hitting a straight with a Q or perhaps a K or A would beat the other players pair).  But raising on the river was not a play that could be based on the strength of the pair of Aces.  Your top pair can only beat second pair or a busted draw.  As we saw there were two possible straights. Just calling on the end minimizes your losses and give you a chance to win if, for some reason, the other player had a J-blank or perhaps a busted straight draw."
Bankroll Management on a Monthly Budget,"In general, I don't think there should be lots of changes. If you have x dollars in your bankroll now, and if you have the financial situation where you can afford to add y dollars per month to your roll over z months, then your virtual bankroll z months in the future is x + yz. You still need honestly to assess your win rate and variance to know whether this is sufficient for the stakes you're playing and for your tolerance of the possibility of going broke. I have a major question though: If you're planning to add to your bankroll monthly, why would you also cash out any monthly winnings? If you want to move up in stakes eventually, I think it's important to If you're always pulling money into and out of the poker account, it seems like you're not likely to be treating it as a serious dedicated space. That's totally fine if you want poker to be a fun way to spend time and maybe with some luck make some extra money. But if you want to move up in stakes and have both your level of play and your bankroll well-suited for the move, I think it's important to be able to honestly assess your poker-related cashflow, and you can only do this through keeping records. I'm worried that being able to casually add and subtract from your bankroll makes it harder to keep yourself honest about your play, and it might make it easier for you to ""hide"" from deficiencies in your play. ""Aw, I think I'll make this call even though I think I'm beat and not getting sufficient odds, because it's the 29th of the month and I get to add another $100 tomorrow anyway."" It's a totally legit way of thinking if you're comfortable with it, but I think you would need to explicitly acknowledge that in doing this you're not optimizing your play. In terms of improving your play, I think you'd be better off in many ways in treating your poker bankroll as a limited resource, adding to it only in cases of high negative variance or as a means by which to level up in stakes. "
Formula for making a single pair on the flop,"The probability would be calculated by taking the odds of having 1 card pair and then the other two cards NOT pairing or forming a set.  Calculate this for the three combinations (1st card pairs, 2nd card pairs, and third card pairs) and add them together: NOTE 1:
The number of cards that are appropriate for each step are: Line 1:   Line 2 and 3 are similar, except that we delay the pairing of the hole card until the 2nd and 3rd card. NOTE 2:
This also assumes that you are ignoring the possibility of the board pairing (in addition to pairing one of your hole cards).  If we want to exclude that possibility (which is the same as the answer given on the calculator that you used), then we would use: NOTE 3:
If you want to get even more accurate, you would also need to include the probability of not pairing either of your hole cards, but the board pairing (or making a three of a kind) independant of your hole cards.  This is slightly more complicated, but we have already determined how they came up with their answer. NOTE 4:
This also assumes that you weren't dealt a pair in the first place."
"Have people been playing ""40% strategies"" in tournaments in the current century?","Your ""40% Strategy"" label is a bit misleading. Often, aggressive strategies do well by making the opponent fold frequently. If you have a 40% hand, it's often very good to make your opponent fold! I take it that the spirit of your question is to ask what makes such strategies work, when to employ them, and whether people often do employ them. What makes these strategies work? (1) Fold equity. If you can make your opponent fold often enough, it's OK to win only 40% of the time you're called. (2) Increasing variance. If you are worse than the other guy, often it is less bad to take a risky chance for big money than to suffer the alternative, which is to let the opponent have smaller, consistent edges over you. In this way you can trade a very bad situation for a less bad one. When should you use such a strategy? These answers follow from the above. (1) When the opponent is better than you, you can't quit, and you have reasonable equity. (2) When you think the opponent might fold frequently. Who uses such a strategy? Many players still do, but fewer do so successfully. Poker players are less willing to fold too often than they were five to ten years ago. Many players have so much online experience that they don't worry about losing one stack or one tournament buyin."
Straight w/ 4 board cards: Reacting to a Nit,"You characterize the villain as very tight so with that in mind, his range is narrow and rarely includes any bluffs, if any at all. I'm guessing you think the same. That said, I'd split his range into two parts, his core range and a secondary range. If i'm discounting bluffs almost entirely (and I am), and to a certain degree his secondary range. What i'm asking myself is, how likely will he raise without the straight. As you say, and I agree, rarely if ever will the villain raise without the straight (i.e. Qx). So, if I break it down to combos that have the straight, villain has... Thus, of 21 possible matchups ~40% (8 of 21) of the time you're crushed, and ~60% (13 of 21) of the time you're a slight underdog due to the chance of him having flush draw possibilities as well! I ran the equity and you have just over 30%. It only becomes about ~50% equity if I add in all the non-straightening hands and secondary range too. As it stands, if I continue in this hand, i'm committed to see a showdown and thus it seems like an easy decision in hindsight, but no doubt tougher at the table. My decision is it's a fold. At this point, I don't think you've committed enough money to make it an error to fold, but it's probably closer than I'd like. I'd play it like you did, and hope to find a fold at the turn. As for alternate lines..."
Rivering a full house,"I would put in a re-raise of at least $50. Try and get some value out of the hand.  If it all folds, you've made some money still.  On the other hand if the BB decides to go back over the top of you then you are laughing :)"
What % of tournament winners do it without going all in,"Other than mining published tournament data or summaries of your own data sets, I don't believe there are direct avenues to access this specific kind of data. That said I'd be willing to bet, with almost absolute certainty, that there isn't a tourney in history (with significant participants) where the winner wasn't all in at some point prior to the final hand.  That said, the frequency of their all ins is tempered by the stack size they posses. Better players = larger average stack size so it probably less than average frequency, but considering chip-to-stack ratio it's still probably all in multiple times per tournament.  Equity per decision is probably more relevant. "
Should you make your choice of gaming location based on the promotions or the players?,"What do you consider a ""pro-player mentality"" is? As you mention, ROI is perhaps the most important aspect to consider, if poker makes up a significant part of your income. If you can objectively judge what you gain (e.g. Accessibility, Comfort, Money, Social, etc.) by playing in a particular location, then you may feel that you'd be better off playing there. Even monetarily, when taking up the benefits of a promotion being offered. For example, your opponents may not be as easy to beat but, the gain you receive from a promotion may make up for it. Being professional just means taking a rigorous, critical look at the information that's available to you and using it to achieve work that is consistently qualitatively superior to that of an amateur. In poker terms, using promotions is similar to ""bonus-whoring"" and, despite it's name, is a great way to increase your ROI. Why not use these promotions to your advantage!"

A Hand history: Navigating QQ,"Your thinking is good, although with a hand this strong as QQ and no history you definitely want to push more preflop and probably got it in. QQ has the most value before the flop so make him buy the full value. This also eliminates the positional advantage as well. Sure, he may have AA, KK but what could you do? Personally, i don't like to pay 11 BB (or about 11% of my stack) for just peeking the flop, then fold on an A♥ K⋄ 7♠ Your thinking of let's wait to see the flop for A/K is not unreasonable, but there are problems to this: Personally, i don't like to pay 1/10 of my stack just to fold on a flop with overcards, that's too expensive and a bit scared money. When the money is gathered preflop, you're looking to commit money preflop with such powerfull, yet vulnerable post-flop hand, especially out of position (OOP)"
Must you show your cards if you are playing the board?,"The short answer is yes, always. Most poker rooms and rule books state plainly that you must table your cards face up to have any claim to a pot. Tabling your cards means placing them face up on the table, so that all players can see them. If you say my hand is the board and muck your cards your hand is dead and you will have no claim on the pot. related posts: Do I have to show my hand in an ""All-In"" situation?

Preflop game in 50/50 sit'n'go,"Well, IMHO, your analysis is pretty good.  However, you see this kind of play all the time even in big tournaments.  And in general, this play from the A8 is usually not a bad one. Whenever you have a super-short stack (really anything under 10 BBs) then they are capable of pushing with just about anything.  In fact, there comes a time that it just doesn't matter what cards you have and you have to push (I've done this many, many times -  I just don't look and push because ... well ... I have to).  This usually happens when the short-stack is in later position where they have a chance to either push out the blinds or just go against a smaller number of player to get the best odds even with 72os (hey, they do win sometimes). This player was so short-stacked, it's hard to have any respect for their hand.  But, in general, if a short-stack pushes in early position, then you have to guess they have some fairly decent cards - maybe an A - but pocket-pair???  That might be pushing a credible guess of their range - possible, but not likely. This is what A8os might have been thinking.  He may have thought that his A was good enough against the range of the short-stack.  I've seen it a million times.  But, I agree he should have pushed rather than just called with A-rag to isolate the short-stack against the big-stack in the blinds.  The call is a weak move.  This is all based on the kicker - the 8.  The 8 is a really weak kicker, especially in the cut-off with a big stack to the left. So, the analysis looks like a player ""falling in love"" with his A against a weak position and not considering play to his left.  It is a mistake in this situation, but is actually usually the right move as the A alone will likely give you the best of it even with the blinds to come in a short-handed table. The BB really can't make a big-stack bully move here - I mean he could, but it's a risk to put a third of your stack in on a play like that late in a tournament.  The BB has NO IDEA, what UTG+2 has.  It could be AA for all he knows.  May be UTG+2 just forgot to push with their AA - it could be anything.  It has to be an OK hand or they wouldn't call in the first place.  The only way the BB would either call or go over the top and push would be if the BB had a rocking hand (AK, JJ or better pocket pair). Until, of course, the short-stack turns over 99 or KK or AA - story of my poker life ;-). "
Why some people all-in in the VERY first hand?,"This sounds like a play money game, am I correct? If so, then I can assure you these same people would not be doing this in a real money game in almost all typical circumstances, except maybe a tournament structure where the blinds are very high relative to stack sizes. The simple answer to your second problem is, a better starting hand than your opponents. Ideally the fewer opponents you're up against the better, as your relative hand strength will be superior than in situations as you describe, with multiple all-ins. A simple starting hand chart should give you a good point to begin from when making these decisions. In general, just pay attention to your opponents hands that they show, and adjust your own all-ins accordingly to take advantage. I suggest depositing a very small amount of money into a real money account on a major poker site and playing very small stakes. You could even just watch a few games after downloading the software to get a feel for what it's like."
Teaching source for putting players on hands?,"The basic book is ""how to read a hand"" of Ed Miller. You can find the first here

How Can I Tell If My Opponent Is Aware Of My Image/Range?,"This answer will be from an online perspective, fwiw. First, some general thoughts: Basically, only thinking players (i.e. regulars) will consider what your range is and make their decisions based on it. How deeply they think about your range and how accurately they can hand read will vary a lot from regular to regular. Fish will almost never hand read or figure out what your range is. On the other hand, your image is much more transparent. If you're raising every hand, even the most clueless fish can pick up on that. A fish might even overreact to such a thing whereas a reg will understand that you're probably just getting a decent run of cards or are isolating a really big fish or something. Onto the specifics: TAG 3bet range: Lots of TAGs will 3bet all sorts of junk and a standard value range like JJ+/AQ (is this 6max? That range is tighter for Full Ring, fwiw). 3betting junk is fine vs you, assuming that you fold to 3bets a reasonable percentage of the time. One problem is that the fish can be spewy enough to overcall the 3bets so this can make for a huge problem for the TAG occasionally (fwiw for the TAG this is a huge problem for him OOP and a small one IP). I'd personally 3bet lots of weak Ax and Kx suited hands for their blockers and ability to flop something decent post. This of course adjusts based on how often you call/fold/4bet. I'm tighter than most here but I'd call with lots of broadway type hands. OOP, unless we're really deep with the fish, I'm not looking to call with lots of SC type hands. If you had opened instead of isolated, the ranges above would be tighter. Your range is looser because you're isolating, so the TAG can loosen his range vs you because your range is weaker than when you open. Most TAGs will be aware of this dynamic but if the TAG is getting more involved by 3betting/flatting your iso more often than he would versus a standard open, he's aware of the situation."

How do I structure the blind levels of a tournament to run for a certain length (on average)?,"A quick Google search gave me this article called How to Set Up a Poker Blinds Schedule which is a good start for helping you decide your blind structure. The most important factors in how long your tournament will last are what your starting blinds are as percentage of starting chips, how many levels you will have, and how long each level lasts."
"What is a ""dead raise""?","When you straddle in the traditional sense in a poker room that allows them, it's considered a ""live"" straddle. Several popular variations of straddling exist, but one common element is that they're ""live.""  This means that the straddler is paying for the privilege of acting last in the pre-flop round of betting. If the dealer in your example is saying that it's a ""dead"" raise, that simply means that the bet is not a live straddle but rather just a bet placed blindly that doesn't confer any additional benefits."
Four of a kind and Three of a kind at the same time. What are the odds?,"p is 0.0000046642 Here are two different ways to arrive at that result... If you have XY, there is one way to make ""quad X"" and C(3,2) ways to make ""set Y"". If you have XY, there is also one way to make ""quad Y"" and C(3,2) ways to make ""set X"". C(3,2) is 3, so starting from XY, there are 6 possibilities to make what you called the ""big full house"" (very nice hand btw) if the deal goes to river. You know your two holecards, so there are 50 cards left (as far as you're concerned, you have no idea what your opponents have). There are C(50,5) ways to choose 5 cards out of 50, which gives 2 118 760 possibilites. So if you do not start with a pocket pair, you have: p = 6 / 2 118 760  (or approximately 0.000002831845) If you have XX the probability is actually higher, for you can make a hand with any Y (there are 12 Y left): So there are 72 possibilities out of 2 118 760 boards to come. So if you start with a pocket pair, you have: p = 72 / 2 118 760  Note that I did write some piece of code to try this and found both 6 possibilities when you start without a pair and 72 possibilities when you start with a pocket pair, while trying all the possible boards of five cards to come. If you want to ""combine"" these two, there are 3/51 (i.e. 1/17) that you're dealt a pocket pair and 48/51 (16/17) that you're not, so: 72 / 2118760 * 1/17 + 6 / 2118760 *16/17 = 0.0000046642... Which can be compared to user ""rphv""'s method (drawing 7 cards out of 52) formula: (13 * 12 * 4) / 133784560 = 0.0000046642..."
Bank Roll Management @ Multiple Tables,"I remember reading on pocket fives a long time ago that you will want one extra buyin, beyond the typical recommendation of 25-40 buyins, for each additional table that you will be playing.  20 buyins is a little on the low side unless you can afford to replace it if you go broke.  If you start with 40 buyins, the chance of going broke (assuming that you are a winning player) is very very low. Keep in mind that you will not be able to pay as close attention to each table so you will be sacrificing some EV by multi-tabling.  This means that your variance will go up and your average win rate will go down, however your overall money won will be higher because of volume if it isn't too bad."
What is the maximal pot bet if one of the players has less chips than minimum raise,"In pot limit games when a bet is outstanding, the amount you can raise by is calculated after your call of the existing bet is added to the pot. Here, the current pot is 200. It doesn't matter that the BB would have paid more if he had more - the amount of a pot-sized bet is based on the size of the pot.  Add dealer's call of the current bet, which is another 200. Thus dealer can raise another 400, to a total bet of 600."
Adjusting strategy for MTT,"I think one of the most important aspects of becoming a good player in any kind of game is  knowing yourself. Everyone plays in a different way because they respond to other player's actions and to the cards they're dealt in a different way, because that's just how they are. I suffer from the opposite problem of yours. I usually make into the money in 500~5000 players tournaments - which turns out to be really profitable - however, I often lose at small SNGs and am not-so-good not-so-bad at final tables. I found out that, although I'm certainly not a tight player, I tend to avoid risky hands and big decisions. I play what is called smallball poker, which is actually very common in MTTs, but not as much in small SNGs - because it doesn't work that well in it, specially the so called turbo ones, where the blinds go up real quickly and you have to make big decisions. So I had to adjust my strategy to play SNGs. I personally think smallball poker is a very good strategy for long, big MTTs, and it has been working pretty well for me, but that's because it fits my personality. Players like Gus Hansen made their way to the top by playing very aggressively all through a lot of tournaments. There was this guy - which I can't remember the name - that came from limit poker and made a fortune playing very tightly on MTTs. What I'm trying to say is: It doesn't really matter what strategy you use. Some usually work better than others in this or that type of game, but if it doesn't fit you, it might work sometimes, but it'll usually fail. Find out what's your kind of game and use a strategy that suits you the best - I listed some as suggestions."
Mathematical Derivation of the Chen Formula,"Here's one way that it might have been derived - this won't be the exact method, but it might have been a jumping off point for Chen. First, take the Sklansky hand groupings - take it as given that this is what the Chen formula is trying to reproduce. Then produce a table of grouping for each hand, against a set of features that that hand might have (e.g. whether it is a pair, whether it is suited, whether it is a 1-gap or a 2-gap, what the high card is etc). Then come with a way of converting the Sklansky hand groupings into scores. I took the simple formula Score = 15.5 - GroupNumber The subtraction is to ensure that higher groups have higher scores, and the constant 15.5 is to avoid the need for a constant in the regression I'm about to perform (just a technical detail, doesn't really matter). Then, perform a regression of the score for each hand on each of the features you identified earlier. This gives each feature a contribution to the total hand score. The contributions for each separate feature look like this (roughly - I rounded each one to the nearest 0.5).  Using this table, a hand like AA would get a score of 16.5 under this system (8.5 for being paired, 8 because the high card is an A). A hand like 98o would get a score of 8.5 (5 for being a connector, 3.5 for having high card 9) and 76s would get a score of 10 (5 for being a connector, 2.5 for being suited, and 2.5 for having high card 7). A few interesting points to note - you can immediately see that having an A is way better than having any other card, and having K, Q or J is way better than 2-T. Being suited turns out not to be that important - it's about as important as having a 2-gap, but less important than having a 1-gap or a connector. The neat thing about this is that the 'Score' can be anything. I derived a score from the Sklansky hand groupings, but you could use probability of winning the pot, or EV from a real-world hand history. It is quite plausible that Chen started with something like this, and and refined the formula to make it simpler and to correspond with his intuition."
Could I have won more money with top set on the flop?,"This flop is extremely dry; there are very few draws and given your read it seems that villain wouldn't have hands like 98 in his range anyway. You'll definitely want to just call this bet, for a few reasons. a) We have his range crushed and he'll draw out on us very rarely.
b) When he has air (something like AK, AQ, etc) he might double barrel on turn cards.
c) It gets him to commit his stack with overpairs on turn cards that seem safe for him (and there's a lot of them). So I'm calling with the intention of shoving over a turn bet. If he checks the turn I'm probably betting something pretty damn small  with the intention of shoving the river, but this of course depends on what cards actually come."
Las Vegas: Best casino for 1-2 no limit?,"MGM Grand is my favorite recommendation for first timers. The action is consistently soft, and they cater to 1/2 games. Other rooms are bigger and perhaps fancier, but they also tend to attract a more aggressive, more skilled player. if you are worried about losing your shirt, I would stay away from the likes of Aria, Venetian, Bellagio and wynn. I would also avoid the smaller and local rooms as they tend to have a lot off regular and professional players. One exception to this is Mandalay Bay.its a small room but for some reason they attract a lot of drunk tourists."
Dealer and Small Blind go bust - how does Dealer button move in this case?,"It depends on where you are playing. There are two distinct sets of procedures for moving a button. One is called forward moving button, the other set of procedures does not really have a common title in slang or other wise. The forward moving button is increasingly rare. It has been extinct in Las Vegas poker rooms for at least three decades. It is used widely in California where time is paid on the button. Surviving in Wendover NV at least up until about ten years ago. (I know this because I was working in Wendover when it was changed. I don't know if my occasional mention to the manager about how stupid a forward moving button is had anything to do with that) To contrast the two a forward moving button always moves to the next player in line at the table and everyone posts the blinds they may owe. In the case of the two players going busted in the big and small blind, the button would move to the next player. Who if the players had not gone busted would of been due the big blind. This player posts the big blind on the button. The two players under the gun also post big blinds. Next hand the button moves and there will be three small blinds, one from each of the players that posted the big blinds last hand and a large blind. Next hand the hands would (finally) be normalized. This can go on as others players might go busted on those blinds. This way is not that difficult once it is grasped. Where it becomes stupid IMHO is that it confuses players and seems to be an endless source of debate and even confused floor decisions when it gets a little complicated. It also has the splash pot effect on a hand when all of a sudden there are three or four blinds out there. It is also very unwieldly when the game is short handed and players are lost. And although this way is zero sum over the long run a player gets a huge short term advantage when they get to post blinds in late position, not that big of a deal for a cash game but can be a game changer in a tournament. The other way, which I will call the ""normal way"" the player getting the button is always the last player whom has paid both blinds. (rather it is posted to buy the button or just posted in normal game play is irrelevant). In this case if both the blinds went busted the button would stay with the player whom had it last. The player under the gun would would post a single big blind, there would be no small blind. Next hand the button still stays with that same player whom is still the last player whom has posted two blinds and the two players under the gun post big and small blinds respectively. Then things proceed normally. Extra: With a forward moving button the argument is that it is fairer because everyone can only get the button once a round. That argument has some validity. However in my opinion that sense a fairness is more then neutralized when players get to post blinds on and behind the button. Add to that the added layers of confusion the forward button causes, a normal moving button is by far the better choice in a casino or home game.     I just looked at clarkos answer and he mentioned the concept of a ""dead button"". I would like to clarify that there is no such thing as a dead button. A button as far as the game goes is simply an indicator of the last player to be dealt cards and act. If it is in a empty seat it indicates nothing except that the player a couple feet right of the button is the last to be dealt in and act. Look at it another way the button in a poker game with a center dealer who deals all the cards and keeps the game in order is merely replacement for a deck of cards that is now in the hands of a center dealer rather then passed to the next player to deal. You cannot have a dead button anymore then you could have a dead deck. The procedure that determine the next player to pitch the cards are also the same procedures that determine what player the button is in front off. For all practicable purposes the term dead button is a mute term, nil, null #totallymeaningless. In a game moving the button to an empty seat then calling it dead adds more confusion then clarity about whom is supposed to post and where the action is supposed to start. In a answer, by the same token, the term does nothing to make an answer more clear. Clarko this little bit is not about your answer, it is my pet peeve about the term dead button. My apologies if this came off as directed at you, it is not. "
Is the heads up NLH no mixing Nash equilibrium strategy known?,"The solution is actually known. I can solve it in 2-3 days using a server I rent for that exact purpose (studying poker) and some specialized software.  To the answer from Ying Li: You misunderstand Nash Equilibrium in poker. If you played a perfect GTO strategy, you essentially would be unbeatable. There is no way your strategy would be beat by drunk players or even top players. Literally, by definition, the optimal counter strategy vs a player playing perfect a GTO strategy is to also play a perfect GTO strategy.  Your confusing game theory optimal strategies with maximally exploitative strategies. A maximally exploitative strategy will make more $$ vs a drunk idiot but your max exploit strat will be open to also being exploited. So if the player adjusts or your assumptions about his leaks are wrong you open yourself up to being exploited. While playing a GTO strategy, guarantee's people will not be able to get an edge against you and lets you profit from all of their mistakes without really worrying about how they play. B/c your strategy is perfect, your worst case scenario is facing another GTO player in which case you both will breakeven against eachother. If you face a player playing worse than GTO you will profit (not counting rake). Extreme example: Imagine a player that only plays AA heads up and folds everything else. Max Exploit: Steal 100%, folding everything other than AA when the player enters the hand. Your going to make a ton of money if the opponent doesn't adjust, but your strategy can very easily be exploited. If the player decides to raise 72o your going to be folding KK. GTO Strat: Play a strategy that cant be exploited. That means your not folding KK or QQ or AK preflop. You leaving a lot of money on the table but by not exploiting this player (YOU STILL ARE MAKING A TON OF MONEY JUST NOT THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT VS HIS TERRIBLE STRAT) but at the same time if he changes his strategy the best he will be able to do is to b/e vs you."
importance of psychological factors in poker?,"The short answer to your question is that the psychological factors (PF) in poker are considerable to a high degree.  It has been said that poker is a mind f*** game played with cards.  Online the PF is rather minimized, relative to a live action game. Since a lot of players started online they tend to have a more mathematical dominance in their approach to the game. Even before the poker boom people that were online talking about poker tended to be more technical. The new generation of poker players bought with them to the game an edge that was born of a more mathematical background. As they left their computers and began to play live they have learned the PF side of the game. PF’s are difficult to describe in writing, since PF’s on a high level is more intuitive then technical, so you do not tend to see a lot of questions and answers about it here and at poker forums. The PF’s in poker to me come across in the context of tells. Tells are what one observes about a player and what one projects to the other players at the game. Everything is a tell about a player. Tells are lies disguised as truth, and truth disguised as lies. The more you understand about a player the more you can clear away the act and get down to the fact. All those things you listed, fear, greed, respect, insecurity etc. are the context of tells. They are generally human emotions, and drivers, they are the reference for the context for tells. Understanding were a player is coming from is important to understanding were they are going and the path they are trying to take. They all add to the accuracy of tells, the more you understand about a player, the more accurate your decisions about the hand can be. Let me digress, and suggest some reading. The bible of poker books for tells is Mike Caro’s Book of Tells. He writes about player mannerisms and what they mean. Another book I would like to suggest is The Professor, the Banker, and the Suicide King: Inside the Richest Poker Game of All Time. A fun read about a head up 50K/100K limit Texas hold’em game were a syndicate of high limit players went up against a Texas billionaire named Andy Beal. What is interesting in our context is how Beal hid his tells. In essence a baseball cab, sunglasses and a stop watch he used to randomize the time he would take to act on his hand. If you are reading in poker books I would dare say that most have a discussion about the PF’s of poker. Every player is different. You are I am sure, not me. When it comes to the PF’s of poker I believe that the most important factor is oneself. Everybody needs to approach the game from the point of ones abilities. Some people do well behind the glasses and the hat and the expressionless faces, Chris “Jesus” Ferguson is a player like this. He sits still, says little, the only tell he gives in the game is the time he takes to make a decision on a hand, and it may well be this is not a good indicator of the strength of his hand. Then there is a guy like Mike “The Mouth” Matusow, he really is not capable of closing his mouth. He simply unnerves his opponents and mixes his tells to a rather cryptic level. The important point here is that each of these guys learned to work with the personality they have, and it is what any player who is successful has learned to do. Most players inherently are able to read other players fairly well. But there are SF’s that keep the majority of players the majority of the time from acting correctly on the information they have. Some are just so much into their own BS that the simply cannot come to the correct decision about what to do at a poker game.  They are simply dysfunctional when it comes to understanding what is right under their nose. They might be a beginner who simple does not trust themselves to believe what they see because they have not yet experienced enough context, or they might be an old experienced player who has suffered so many beats, that anything he does see he cannot act correctly on. One of the most common things heard at a poker table is “I Know I am beat but I just have to look you up” and most of the time they are.  Spousal cheating is a great example in the extreme of the psychological phenomenon that keeps people from acting rationally for a while.   You have some clue that it is going on, but you simply do not want to believe that it is happening. Because the consequences of it happening means a great loose to you, you want to avoid this loose, you do not want to come to grips of what it means when you lose. Same with poker the inclination is to think in terms of winning, so to think in terms that you might lose is unnatural. When you consider any hand the process is really one of coming to terms with losing the hand, winning the hand is status quote.  Coming back to PF in poker, PF in a live game is one of the most powerful tools you can possess. There is no real argument between what is more important, math or PF, they are both key to a great poker player. Understanding were your player is coming from, not only makes it easier to read them, it also makes it easier for one to take them off their game. All poker players are humans, and as such are not perfect. Even the best players have bad days, and understanding what makes a day bad for them at the table, is just one more way to increase your expectation against them at the table. Having discipline at the table, to do the things in ways that work best for you, is how you defend against the other players. Having an open mind about yourself, your faults, and your strengths is the best way to overcome your weakness and become a strong poker player. All that stuff is in the mind, and all about the psychological factors, and if you cannot overcome them you will not have a shot in the long run of beating the game. "
Order for revealing hands with multiple side pots in play,"Player E shows the hand first, and then players reveal their cards in clockwise manner. The dealer selects winner(s) of sidepots and main pots.

How to Decide Whether to Buy the Add On or Not in Rebuys,"The aim of poker is to have all the chips at the end of the tournament, so the more chips you have at any one time, the better. If you are one of the chip leaders then don't bother, you already have plenty of chips to boss people about with. If you are close to the chip lead and the add on is good value then I would probably take it. If you are low then you should always take it as you need the chips. On PKR they run a few tournaments where you have more than one stack that you can get at any time for free. I always take them all right at the start and just boss people about. That's why you need as many chips as possible."
Easy to remember push/fold/callpush table/formula,"A push/fold table can be an unexploitable strategy in short stacked heads up play. It has been solved using game theory, for example in Mathematics of Poker. There exists easy to remember approximations of the exact solution. One of them is SAGE (sit and go endgame system).
A search on that will give you many good articles explaining it, but the short version goes like this:
Calculate the Power Index (PI) for your starting hand. 
PI = face value of top card * 2 + face value of bottom card
Add 2 if suited
Add 22 if pair (i.e. always push) E.g
QTo = 12*2 + 10 = 34
86s = 8*2 + 6 + 2 = 24 In the SB, if PI >= (number of BB in shortest stack + 19) then push all-in
Call in the BB if you have 4 higher in PI than is needed to push in SB. This strategy is unexploitable for stacks ~<= 8 BB, a common scenario at the end of tournaments. Unexploitable means that even if you tell your opponent that you are playing this strategy, there is nothing he can do other than play the ""call if PI is 4 higher""-response. Any other strategy will have lower expected value. Note that unexploitable does not mean best. If you have an edge over your opponent some adjusted strategy might have higher expected value, but leaves you open to exploits (e.g. your opponent plays Sage).
In practice it is a good baseline strategy. Stick to it if you feel you're out of you league. Make small adjustments if you feel your opponent doesn't have clue. As for a table driven strategy for non-short-stacked multiplayer tables, don't do it. It is exploitable and the play in those situations depends on far more factors than what can be captured in a table."
Is Colin Moshmans Book Still A Relevant Micro SNG Reference,"Although poker is changing all the time fundamentally the game is still the same. Its only really peoples strategies that change. If this book has been recommended in several places then its obviously a good book even if it is 5 years old. So you should probably take a look at it, if you get the opportunity. In my opinon the best way to continue to learn is to read about poker on the internet and by being on sites like this. That way you tend to keep up with the latest trends etc."
The groups of Sklansky starting hands,"The Sklansky hand rating is also inclusive of post flop playability and implied odds. A simply equity calculation would render T8o better then 89s. This clearly isn't the case though. You have to consider how the hand flops relative to villain range, and it's post flop playability. Do not base hand ranking on pure jam equity because you will be ignoring too many other factors. A hand like 89s can flop flushes, straights etc, more often and better then T8o. Although preflop equity might show different, T8o is often useless postflop- even if you flop TP because you have to fold it too often. With 89s you will often have backdoor equity etc."
Starting hands head up,"I am a regular poker player and I play poker tournaments almost every day.
Also I have a big heads up experience.
I read 3 poker books including Mathematics of Poker and Intelligent Poker Player. In headsd-up it is recommended to open raise from Small Blind with 70% of hands. You can learn best 70% of hands downloading free popular poker calculator Equilab. As you are a beginner 70% may seem too many for you. But it is so because when you are a Small Blind in heads up you will be in position at postflop. Playing postflop in position is more profitable. There are no well known static preflop ranges for heads up that became a standard. Personally I like to open raise from SB no limit heads up with 60% of hands:
22+,A2s+,K2s+,Q2s+,J2s+,T3s+,95s+,85s+,75s+,64s+,54s,A2o+,K2o+,Q5o+,J7o+,T7o+,97o+,87o And I raise not to 2BB but to 2.5 or 3BB. It is not new and many players plays approximately so. It is normal to call open raise of SB from BB with 65% of hands. Calling from BB should be tighter than SB raises. I call with 55% of hands: 33+,A2s+,K2s+,Q2s+,J3s+,T5s+,95s+,85s+,75s+,65s,A2o+,K4o+,Q6o+,J7o+,T7o+,97o+,87o The range for 3BET from BB positoin is different almost for any player. It is normal to 3Bet with 25-10% of hands. Sometimes it is better not to 3BET with AA, KK, QQ. Many heads up players does not 3Bet at all. I suppose you are interested in the most popular no limit mode. There are in internet precalculted push/fold charts for heads up and not only heads up. How to play with all-in in a late trounament stage when effective stacks are less than 12BB. I know 2 commercial applications for calculating perfect preflop push/fold range tables: Holdem Resource Calculator and Icmizer 2."
Joining and rejoining a texas holdem poker game that is already in progress,"Joining the game for the first time. Case 1: The new player takes seat 6. The next hand he can post the BB
  and be dealt a hand. Nothing changes. This is correct Case 2: The new player takes seat 4. The next hand he is not allowed
  to play until the dealer has passed him. The dealer will be seat 3, SB
  will be seat 5 and BB will be seat 6. This is correct, however it is perfectly fine to allow a player sitting in between the small blind and button to buy the button by posting both blinds. He will be able to play then receive the button the next hand. Case 3: The new player takes seat 2. The next hand the dealer will
  jump over him and he will be asked to either post the BB and be dealt
  a hand or wait for the BB. This is correct, however it is perfectly fine to allow a player sitting in between the small blind to buy the button by posting both blinds. He will be able to play then receive the button the next hand. This is also true for a returning player with missed blinds. Rejoining the game (sitting back in). Case 1: The player is on seat 6. If the blinds didn't make a table
  round then the player will post BB and be dealt a hand. Nothing
  changes. If the player missed the big blind the player needs to post both blinds, if the player did not miss the blinds he is dealt back in without posting. Case 2: The player is on seat 4. He missed only the big blind. He
  needs to post only the SB (dead money) to be dealt a hand or wait for
  BB. No sure about this one. I am assuming you made a typo and meant missed only small blind. A player really cant miss just the big blind, and you did not address the missing only the small blind anyplace so I think the assumption your talking about missing the small blind is safe. If he missed only the small blind he needs only to post the small blind. This may not be dead, since the small blind he missed is not dead The small blind is only dead when it is posted with the big blind. However, if the player stays away long enough were the blinds come back around to his seat, and he is not there to take the blinds he has than missed both blinds. Case 3: The player is on seat 2. Having missed both blinds, the dealer
  will jump over him and he will be asked to either post SB + BB and be
  dealt a hand or wait for the big blind. If he chooses to post both
  blinds, the small blind will be considered 'dead', will be added to
  the pot and it will not count as a raise to the other players. This is correct. The things get complicated and I do not understand what happens when
  there are two players playing head-to-head and a third player joins.
  Possible cases: Player joins one of the seats: 5, 3 or 1 or rejoins
  the game on one of those seats. The solution here is that the players keep playing head up until the new player, or returning is in a position to take the big blind. At this point the player whom had the Small blind the last hand will get the button. Just as an aside outside out of the scope of your questions a bit. I would consider keeping your code very agile, or consider even adding configuration for this part of your program. The way blinds are made up, and rules for new players are somewhat subject to change over time. For example allowing players to make up blinds between the button and the small blind, called buying the button, is something relatively new.

TAG vs LAG stats in HU,"sharkscope.com lets you search for stats of some famous players, you can check it.  Dont try blindly to copy/achieve that stats, your play depends on your opponent tendencies, your goal is to have profit, therefore you have to consider your opponent tendencies to play. Heads Up especially is very ""wild"" and your decisions vary a lot depending on your opponent.  Also, if there is stat like ""PFR = 50%"", it does not mean, that the player plays the top 50% of hands. He can have like 30% from top hands and 20% hands from bottom range to balance his strong/weak ranges and confuse opponents."
Shuffle in middle of hand,"I used to be a croupier and worked at various casinos. The best solution that I know of for the accidentally exposed card after the flop is to announce it and place it on top of the deck. When ready to deal the next card, burn the exposed card from the top, burn two cards from the bottom of the deck and place the third one as the turn or the river. If this action was taken for the turn, the advantage is that the order of the river card does not change. What you were going to get at the river before the accident still is dealt as the river. If you shuffle the cards, the natural river card changes. There would be an advantage of shuffling the cards too as the accidentally exposed card would be added to the deck just in case if one of the players would need it on the board; however adding an exposed card back to the deck would look unprofessional and is not very likely to hit the turn or the river anyway. But shuffling the cards without any any dealer mistake of exposing a card would be stupid in any case."
Fictitious play for multiway hand in push or fold regime,"The exact algorithm, for any particular piece of poker software, I don't know. However, I think I have some thoughts that may perhaps answer the question at hand.
No human is going to run an ICM calculation in their head. Perhaps, if one practices a lot, one could calculate somewhat accurately their ICM for 6/9-Max SNGs. In a MTT there are usually hundreds of players, and we could be near the end, or near the top of the MTT.  ICM will help us to discover the theoretical $$'s to Chips ratio. If we are in a 9-Max SNG, standard payout, and there are only 3 players left, PLR1 with 3k, PLR2 and PLR3 with 1K, then we can say PLR1 has a greater %$'s lead than %Chips lead. They are much more likely to finish first because they have both players more than covered. Also, PLR2 or PLR3 could knock out the other, in which case you still have a 1.5:1 chip lead and are now heads up. The reason then, one cannot calculate ICM in their head, especially for MTT's, is that one cannot just know their % chance to win with their stack size. This is also problematic for writing an algorithm one may use to represent a theoretical ICM (Not that the software isn't trusty, it's the same as an equity calculator, accurate for the most part but shy on some opponent tells and whatnot...we shouldn't call when we know where beat, even if the odds are correct to do so. The equity calculator may say to call sometimes when we know better). Now, to the beef of the question. Push/Fold! If one is playing push/fold poker, they almost never need to calculate their ICM. Our stack is just too small to worry about our $'s to Chips ratio, and in any case it's very low. Hence, Push or Fold. Push/fold tables can be replicated with any decent equity calculator. Plugh in a hand you would consider pushing with, plug in an opponent's range, and you will yield the % chances that each wins the hand. Since we are pushing preflop, we don't need to rely on postflop skills to win, just a call from villain! Isn't that great! The smaller ones chip stack, the wider ones push range. This again deals with how likely it is one will win the tournament, or cash in it.  Assuming we are not past the bubble, If a player has 2 bb's, how likely are they to win anything? Very unlikely indeed. So any time we get say 30% chance to double up, far more than the chance we cash at all, we push. There are some intricate details to ICM that I won't pretend to understand. However, I hope I succeeded in my explanation of how one may go about crafting a push/fold chart."
What Is The Rationale Behind A Check-Raise?,"Check raising can be used to punish people who auto-bet in position too often.  It's also good for semi-bluffing or building a pot when you've got a made hand vs normal betting frequencies. It's part of a balanced strategy.  If every time you have a hand you donk and every time you check you either check-call or check-fold then your opponents can take advantage of this, knowing you're weak when you check. Check-raising on the river generally polarises a range.  Meaning it's either an amazing hand or nothing.  Turn check raises include some percentage of semi-bluffs, where the raiser has enough fold equity + pot equity to make it profitable.  "

What are recommended computer programs for learning No Limit Texas Hold'em?,"You can use some ICM-training programs, like: ICM Trainer - it can help you understand how to play late phase of a tournament (when to push/fold). You can also use some Equity calculators - using those you can understand relative hand strenght in given circumstances. I recommend: Equilab There are also many programs, which can help you analyze your game. Most of the software I'm thinking about here is designed to help you during the play (by displaying a HUD with your and your opponents stats), but you can also use them to review your previous games (i.e. to find leaks). Examples here would be: Poker Tracker and Holdem Manager."
NL600: Should I Make This River Bluff vs Reg?,"Check-fold.  You are not repping a Queen on the turn, here.  Rather, you are repping a bluff.  If you actually had a queen, wouldn't you check-raise fairly often? If you think there's dead money in the pot and you are trying to win it, check-raise the flop or the turn.  But beware that against a good regular who has position on you, you're going to be hard-pressed to find a lot of dead money."
Unexpected aggression and a premium hand,"This shouldn't even be a debate/question. It's a standard jam. There's nothing else to do here. Your hand is too strong, there are too many missed draws, and so on. You're truly, 100% overthinking this. You have a monster. Get it in. If Villian has a set or weird two-pair, rebuy and move on to the next hand.
I've seen too many posts like this. I might be wrong, but you likely jammed and ran into a two pair, J8 most likely, or a set, and started to question your play. Don't let coolers like this get to you. You are giving people too much credit.  EDIT:
Also, I want to point out that if you're at the point where the whole table thinks your so much of a rock/nit that you have to fold an overpair like KK on this board because they're only playing back at you with better, then you're doing something wrong. You need to take advantage of your image. If the  whole table thinks your a nit, play loose. If they think you're a loose maniac, play tight. You shouldn't be playing a fixed strategy that doesn't take into account your image and how everyone else is playing."
Is a semi-unlimited stack a significant advantage?,"Of course it is. If you're a player who knows the game, then having a big stack will also give you a crucial psychological advantage. Your opponents will fold to your bets and raises much more often, this will allow you to make much more effective bluffs. They know that the guy with the big stack is able to go all-in without a significant risk to himself. Which means he's much more likely to do it, even with marginal hands. This big stack effect is amazingly powerful, surprisingly even. Even good players, that know this fact well, can't supress it. There are 2 key characteristics of the big stack effect: If, when you play, you find yourself among the biggest stacks, do this: Bottom line: Having a big stack gives you an obvious advantage. But it's an advantage that is easily lost. Just be careful with it, especially if you're not used to being in this position. |1| = this is usually the reason why the guy who is chip leader in the middle stage of a tournament can finish in a mediocre position (for example 20th / 100 participants). If I remember correctly, this happened once at a WSOP Main Event final table. The chip leader finished 9th i.e. he was the first one knocked out."
Fold AKo preflop?,"The top 6-max cash game guys playing zoom500 will happily get 100BB in pre-flop with AKo. However the playerpool is really tough and aggresive, so maybe against some tighter live players it is not optimal. Let's discuss how you should play AKo in this spot. You are 200BB deep. This is probably too deep to get AKo in pre-flop. However, he raises to 8.3x the big blind. I'd assume that these big sizes are around the standard size pre-flop in this place. His range doesn't have to be that strong. He can easily have hands like T8s, A5s, QJo. I'd for sure 3-bet and call an all-in in this spot. I can see him shoving AQ, 99+ and a bluff every once in a while. You block aces and kings. You have to call $230 to win $370. So you need around 38% equity. You easily have that. This is a mandatory call. Even if your percieve his range to be as tight as JJ+ and AK you still have 39.79% equity! (I use this site for calculations https://web.archive.org/web/20210313015037/http://www.propokertools.com/simulations) Playing AKo like this is a massive mistake. Why should you 3-bet this hand if you are folding to a shove? Are you bluffing or raising for value? If you really don't want to get AKo in, then don't 3-bet. Use weaker hands like A5s to 3-bet fold and stronger hands like QQ to 3-bet call. Make your 3-betting range more polarized. But again I think AKo should be in your 3-bet call range."
Is there a hand gesture for calling?,"TL;DR: Please just say the word ""call."" I suspect different house rules might apply here, but in my experience, these are general rules. YMMV. Also, I'm basing this answer on the TDA rules, which is a common but not universal set of rules. It's acceptable to just put in a single chip to represent a call. If that chip represents more than the bet amount, that's still a call according to TDA rule 45: 45: Oversized Chip Betting When facing a bet or blind, pushing out a single oversized chip is a call if raise isn’t first declared. If that single chip represents less than the amount of the bet before you, then that's an undercall and represents a binding full call in most cases.  According to rule 39: 39: Binding Declarations / Undercalls in Turn A: General verbal declarations in turn (such as “Call” or “Raise”) commit a player to the full current action. See Illustration Addendum B: A player undercalls by declaring or pushing out less than the call amount without first declaring “call”. An undercall is a mandatory full call if made in turn facing 1) any bet heads-up or 2) the opening bet on any round multi-way. In other situations, TD’s discretion applies. I guess you're opening yourself up to some gray area in the undercall situation, but the ambiguity seems more to protect you as a potential caller when you might have misinterpreted the amount of a raise in front of you. Either way, please just say the word ""call."" It makes life simpler for everyone and keeps the game moving. Nobody likes it when one player tries to live in the gray area where the dealer and others have to continually wonder about the action."
What should hero do with JJ overpair on the Flop against an ultra aggressive (perhaps maniac)?,"Pre-flop: After his re-raise you should push or fold. He already commited 1/3 of his stack here. Raising so large in position is a very bad strategy. Take advantage of this by never calling, unless you want to do the occasional slowplay. Like you said seeing a flop out of position with jacks is not very good. Should you push jacks? Really depends on his range, but if there is the occasional pockets nines and AQs in there you should shove. Flop: Having called you see a very monotone board. It does not really change the situation, if one player was ahead pre-flop he still is now. You should always check here. It is by far the best and frankly your only good option. If you go all-in you will make him fold AK, AQ, 99 or all his bluffs, but he will call with QQ+. A terrible situation for you. As a general rule you should check when your opponent has a range advantage, which is the case here. So push or fold pre-flop and check the flop once you did call."
Why to post big blind in online poker?,It is just a rule of poker.  When you take a seat you must wait for the BB to come to you before you can start playing.   Or you can post a BB to start playing immediately. Imagine this scenario.  A player stands up when the BB gets to them then sits back down when the SB passes.  If they don't pay to play then they have avoided paying the binds. If you sit down in late position then it might be worth paying a BB to play immediately.  If you are in early position it is not worth paying a BB to play immediately as you are not only playing out of position but you only have to wait a round or two to come in on the BB.
Avoid Costly Mistakes,"I agree generally with the other answers, but I just wanted to point out that I think your post looks a lot like the specific type of tilt known as ""entitlement tilt."" Jared Tendler's books on the mental game get good reviews.  This graphic also enumerates different types of tilt and has a few tips from him, including entitlement tilt tips: http://jaredtendlerpoker.com/wp-content/uploads/7-Types-of-Tilt.pdf"
How to play when you hit a straight,"I would agree with some of the previous answers on this one, although it is easy to be influenced by seeing the outcome.   Preflop:  no problem with your check here, but let's start to think ranges right away.  Villian is just calling in position.  His range is wide but eliminates strong premium hands.  Button is going to raise frequently with A10-AK and any pockets 10 and up here.  They will also be folding junk here most of the time.  A safe range here is any face card with medium kicker any two suited connectors or suited gap cards as well as low pockets that are looking to make a cheap set. Flop: You picked up a draw and are leading out.  The bet here is okay if you are trying to take down the pot and exemplify any pair.  A check here would also be an okay play in my opinion, but if you are going to call with an overcard and a draw anyway better to be the aggressor.  Villian calls so again let's consider and try to narrow his hand range.  A J with any kicker 5-10 is definitely in play here as are Q7-Q8 K7-K8 10/9 Q9 also, 22-99 are live here as well.  Your bet is small enough to try and trap with 3 of a kind or play for the miricale set. It is unlikely that he his calling u with air and only one over card/no draw, but not impossible.   Turn:  great card and you made your strait.  Unfortunately u checked here and tried to trap.  This was in my opinon the mistake of the hand.  You gained no information on your opponent and made no attempt to push out strait draws or the now active flush draw that is definately in your opponents range.  I think the correct play is to bet here.  In my opinion at least 50% of the pot.  Better to take down the pot now if the Villian is on a flush draw or strait draw.  If he made the smaller strait u have him for what will likely be all of his chips.  If he has 2 pair or 3 of a kind he will be inclined to consider a fold as a 9 is well within your range.  Really there was no downside to betting this turn, by not betting and trying to lay a trap u open your hand to him making a better strait, a flush, or quite possibly a full house.  If he were to raise u on a turn bet you would obviously push him for all his chips or make the call if he went ultra agressive and moved all in.  If that happened you would have the same result but it would be simply a bad beat.  River: yikes our fears have possibly come true.  We never ruled out 77s 88s or 99s let alone J7-J9.  I would be very worried about this river but a value sized bet is not a bad play here.  Well shoot he doesn't believe your value bet now what do we do?  He reraises you about 7 times your original bet.  Let's consider his range.  He may have just made 3 jacks and doesn't think u have a 9 based on your turn check.  He also may have made his full house and is hoping u have the 9 and played you over aggressively to draw the all in.  Or maybe he has air and that really is a bluff.  Unlike the other answers I don't think its out of the relm of possibility that he tried to trap on the flop and then was scarred on the turn, but now his hand has improved and he is no longer frightened of your possible strait.  Admittedly this is a hard one to lay down.  If u figured he doesn't have u on a strait 1pair - 3 of a kind is well within his range, and I think a call is okay to make here.  However, the raise was a bad move.  You are only going to get called down by a full house or Q9 on your all in.  Anything weaker is out of here in a flash and you simply win the same you would have with a call at substantially more risk. Conclusion:  bet the turn to zero in his range and scare out the draws that will wreck your hand.  Just call the river reasise since u didn't bet the turn and walk away with some stack left. Hope I helped gl

KK on small blind vs Calling Station,"how would you play this hand knowing that the villain is an
  incredible calling station who will put his entire stack even on the
  2nd pair? You did put all your stack when you were way ahead and he called: that is perfect! I'm not saying that's how you should always play KK like that: but versus an opponent which you know cannot fold, the goal is to go all-in to take your opponent to value town. When he calls you all-in, he has 5 outs. What more do you want? You'll have to learn to deal with the variance: when you are all-in being, say, a 90% favorite (it's just an example), there are deals where you'll still lose the deal. You should not focus on your opponent having hit his 5-outter: focus instead on the fact that you did put all your money while being a huge favorite and that your opponent did follow, which is very good."
Value of Speculative Hands,"I think one thing that's important is that you start the hand realizing that lots of your value lies in really hitting your hand, so you're aiming for the implied odds here. With these speculative hands, you're rarely going to be ahead pre-flop, and even if you are, you're never going to feel comfortable putting much more into the pot, so you usually need to get lucky. Because of that, you need to make sure you can get paid off when you do hit your hand."
"What is the purpose of a continuation bet, and when is it best applied in Hold'em?","By definition, a continuation bet is a bet made on one betting round after you were the aggressor in the previous betting round. Continuation bets are typically made regardless of whether or not the cards that came improved your hand. Most often the term applies to bets made during the second round of betting (the flop in Texas Hold'em) after aggression during the first round of betting (preflop in Texas Hold'em). There are a lot of specific situations that can vary things a lot, but as a general rule, it is best to make a continuation bet when it is likely that your opponent will believe your hand is still better than theirs. This can be a result of the board seeming unlikely to have improved your opponent's hand, a result of the board seeming likely to have improved your own hand, or in some cases a result of your hand being so strong that it did not need improvement. The key concept to keep in mind about deciding whether or not to make a continuation bet is that you want the story your bets tell about your hand to be believable, particularly if your continuation bet is a bluff."
Explaining poker to a chess player,"This question reminds me of a scene from the original Star Trek episode The Corbomite Maneuver where the Enterprise is hopelessly outmatched and the logical Spock makes a chess reference indicating they have lost.  Kirk replies to the effect that instead of playing chess they should play poker, and proceeds to make a bluff that succeeds in getting them out of the situation. Of course later we learn it was less the fact that Kirk bluffed, and more that the aliens hadn't really intended to destroy the Enterprise.  In Star Trek the Next Generation we see a similar pattern, where second in command Commander Riker is great at poker, usually managing to somehow induce the other player(s) to make the wrong assessment as to whether or not he is bluffing. Tell your friend to forget about all these media representations of the game! The basic principle of the game is known as ""ABC Poker"".  There are plenty of guides out there that Google will find for you that go deeper into exactly how to play, but the gist of it is that poker is a very well mathematically defined game, and good play involves making correct decisions based on the statistical outcome of play.  Nothing fancy, just solid play.   The classic example is that of drawing to a flush - if in a particular hand you have a 1 in 4 chance of making your flush with the remaining card to be dealt, and that would give you the best hand, then you should not continue unless you will be getting the proper odds (direct and implied).  Correct decisions have positive ""expected value"".  Part of becoming better at poker involves learning how to identify these situations properly.  For instance, a beginner might see they are getting proper odds to make their flush, but ignore the fact that their opponent likely could beat a flush. Another important principle involves what ""level"" of poker you are playing at.  At level one you know what your hands is.  At level two you start thinking about what hand your opponent has, trying to put them on a range of hands based on their play and adjusting your play accordingly.  You will need to identify how the other player is playing at the moment (e.g. loose-aggressive, passive-tight, etc.) in order to try to put them on a hand. At level three you will start thinking about what hand your opponent thinks you have.  At this stage you will start to realize that certain lines of play will work because they play off what your opponent thinks you have instead of what you really have, and conversely you will abandon certain lines of play, realizing they aren't believable based on what your opponent thinks you have.   For instance, certain spots will become optimal to bluff in because your opponent believes you have the cards that allow you to, and other spots will becoming obvious bad spots to bluff.  Higher levels involve asking questions like ""What does my opponent think I think she has"", ""What does my opponent think that I think he thinks I have?"" etc.  This is very advanced play and requires that you first of all know whether it is even appropriate to be thinking like this - in fact, for optimal play you should generally play one level higher than your opponent, especially at higher levels."
"What is the meaning of ""D"" near with players name?","It means his position is on the dealer button (hence the 'D'), which is the best position to have in Hold 'Em and Omaha games. This position is to the right of the small blind and is last to act on all postflop streets."
$1/$2 Live - Turned top two pair facing heat (line check),"Given the range of hands you are assigning him, I don't think you can profitably call preflop.  You should probably fold, or possibly 3bet if you think he will make the mistake of folding too much (either immediately or to a flop continuation bet).  But I think folding is the best play, exploiting the fact that he is too tight with his open raises. As played, the turn is close between calling and raising.  Some of the tighter players will throw away AQ or AK here if you raise, in which case raising is awful.  If you think his range for shoving is AA, JJ, 99, and (maybe?) AJ, with no bluffs, then you have a clear fold.  He could also have 33, though I'd discount that possibility a good amount given the read you provided."
Why are there two blinds in Texas Hold 'em instead of just one?,"Blinds are the essence of poker games. All strategy is built on the basis of stealing the money that are already in the pot (Dead money). Without the blinds, a player can fold every hand but Aces, thus (in the long term) would never lose money. Now, there are different setups to achieve that, like big and small blinds, two big blinds, blinds with antes, antes only, blinds with antes and straddles, Mississippi straddles etc. Why the traditional ""Big-Small blind"" setup is more common, one argument is that it creates action between (at least) two people in each hand, while what you suggested with just one Super Big blind, would just force the player to call initial raisers more frequently, changing slightly the character of the game as we know it. Still, viable though."
How to fish with nuts?,"As you and others have pointed out, there's a myriad of factors to consider in this situation (as in every hand), so I'll share some real general tips. The nice thing about flopping an unbeatable hand or practically unbeatable hand is that you no longer have to worry about your cards, improving your hand, pot odds or any of that--you're free to turn 100% of your focus to getting inside the mind of your opponent(s), and the effectiveness of which you do this is what will determine how much money you extract. Try to think of all the hands in which you've seen the opponent put in a bunch a chips--how did those hands play out and how can you make this one play out similarly? What's your image in the opponent's eyes? Any history that you have with them can be used as ammo.  At each step in the hand, you should be considering what your move will make the opponent think. If all goes well, you're going to end up putting money in the pot--so do you want to give off the feeling that you're on a draw? that you've got an ok but not strong hand? that you're bluffing?--what would make this opponent put in the most money? You want the whole hand to make sense from their point of view, because when you play as if you have just an ok hand and then end up check-raising all in on the river when they don't see you as someone that makes crazy bluffs, it's going to raise a red flag. Say you have 6h5h and the flop comes 4h7h8h at a loosish table with multiple players in. Don't be afraid to bet out. Players will come along with a flush draw, two pair, a set, or whatever they think looks good. You're building the pot early and disguising your hand (people usually expect everyone to slowplay a hand like that). On the other hand, if you have pocket 3's on a 10-3-3 flop against one or two people who are pretty tight-passive, it might be better to give them another card or two to improve their hand. Whatever will get the most of their money into the pot. That brings me to one key point to remember: you don't need to get ALL of your opponent's chips. For most people, they aren't throwing all their money into the middle willy nilly without purpose, so don't think you can magically get them to do it whenever you want it to happen. The goal is to get the MOST out of them. That might mean getting a bet out of a loose player who doesn't like to fold many flops. It might mean setting up someone for a single value bet on the river or an enticement of them making a small bluff (to which they'll fold to your raise). You can lose out on money by getting too fancy and turning it into an all or nothing hand. You want to play this the same way you've played other hands. By doing so, you'll also help yourself in the future. For example, you could play a draw the same way as you did when you flopped that nut full house. A good opponent will notice the similarities and be more likely to fold when you bluff on the river after missing the draw. One last general tip that I've implemented before is: once the flop comes and you see that you can't lose, make up a imaginary hand (or two) that you'll now play as if you have. For example, when you've flopped that straight flush as above, play the entire hand as if you had the ace high flush draw. If the turn ends up making that a bad plan, think of another hand that would make sense for you to have and continue as if you have that new hand. Another situation could be when you're headsup against a good opponent where there's a long history of being aggressive and bluffing toward each other, imagine having some two specific cards that completely missed the flop but that (imaginarily) you can outsmart him and get him to fold. Play as if that's really what's going on--you're counting on the opponent being good enough to ""see through you"" and to ""outplay"" you, when really he's outplaying himself. Anyways, tl;dr : put yourself in the other player's head, play your hand consistently as if it were some other hand."
Trips vs flush draw on the turn,"You've played the hand fairly weak up to this point: betting $30 into a $200 pot and checking the Ace on the turn. He can't give you much credit for an Ace at the moment - maybe he thinks you have a flush draw or a PP? He is likely to continue bluffing if you just call. Generally how you proceed depends on your table image - if you aren't likely to be raising anything worse than an Ace at this point, the villain fold his flush draw to a large raise. You can shove and win the pot right here. You won't be getting any more money from him though if he is a good player and you aren't getting out of line much. You raise the turn to $350, he must put $200 extra into a ~$900 pot. If the villain has the flush draw he should still be making this call and you make some  extra money. If he misses the river, though, he is unlikely to continue bluffing.  A better play is to be calling his turn bet and check calling him on the river as he will probably turn his draw into a bluff (he thinks he can represent the A or full house given how passively you have played it), and may well shove. I think this is probably the most profitable if he is a loose player and given the way you've played it. Saying this, you would need to be sure that he did have the flush to call any big river bluff. so: The above is, of course, extremely simplified and requires you to know he has the flush draw. Without knowing he has it, though, how can you give him credit for a flush draw? What is he raising to $100 in a $6 game? Are KQ hearts or 89 hearts really in his range? Possibly he has 77, trying to push you off it pre-flop, then made his set on the flop and turned a full house. More likely he has KK and thinks that you have the flush draw. He is a loose player and could be doing this with quite a few hands - 77 or A7/A3 beat you. All his bluffs, draws, or high PPs are behind. I think you should assume you are ahead and be check calling but shouldn't shove -he is only ever calling with the part of his range that has you beat. I don't think there is any fold equity."
Mucked hand. who wins?,In this case it would be the player that mucked last that wins the hand. Just because the other player didn't know you mucked or didn't show his hand doesn't disqualify him from winning - he wins if he mucked last.
How Gus Hansen came up with 30%?,"Your question is a great example of some of the math that you need to carry out at the table. The first part is to know the value you're getting from the situation. Since Gus is calling a smaller amount than what's in the pot, there's an overlay available. To do this you take the pot divided by the amount you have to call: 5200/2200 = 2.36. You can express this by thinking ""I am getting 2.36-1 odds on my money"". Sometimes you hear players say, ""The pot was laying me 2-1"", or something along those lines. Next, you need to translate this into a percentage that gives you a break-even value. If you won an overlay of 2.36 every time, you would be a millionaire in no time, if you won it once every 10 times, you would be broke in no time, depending on the probability that you're right of course! Defining your opponents true range as close as possible will provide that answer. Perhaps the quickest way to get to a number is to add a 1 to your overlay number and change it into ""decimal odds"": 2.36 + 1 = 3.36 To understand how often you need to break even, you would divide 1 by the decimal odds. In this case you need to win about 29.8% of the time (1 / 3.36 = 0.298) of the time. That's close to 1 in 3 tries. Hanson calculated he'd need to win around 30% of the time or more to make calling profitable if he got to showdown with no extra betting. Lets use $1 and your overlay is $2.36 - so now iterate it out as if you were gambling: First try: lose $1 Second try: lose $1 Third try: win $2.36 At the end of 3 tries, you would be netting a win of $0.36 Or, to use Hanson's example: First try: lose $2200 Second try: lose $2200 Third try: win $5200 At the end of 3 tries, you would be netting a win of $800 This is one of the ways that you can evaluate if a move is +EV. Of course, now you have to decide if your hand will actually win 30% of the time. If you're wrong, then its possible you made the right decision, but didn't get the outcome you hoped for this time. Another possibility, which could mean folding more often or perhaps raising is better, is that perhaps you misjudged the strength or weakness of your opponents range. This starts to crossover into questions about showdown value and is beyond the scope of your question. The question ""How do I Calculate Expected Value of Shoving, including Fold Equity, in heads up play?"" covers the maths of this problem in fine detail. Hope that helps!"
In what situations will you lose the low-pot in Omaha Hi/Lo while holding Ace-Deuce?,"You can only lose the low hand if you get counterfeit (when a low card hits the board that also pairs one of your low cards), so that you don't hold the nut low on the river anymore. If there is a low hand possible, and no A or 2 on the board, you always have the nut low. At worst, you will split the low pot if someone else also has a A2XX hand. With that said, it is possible to win a quarter of the whole pot (50% of low pot and 0% of high pot). "
How to behave in crowded pots,In my experience: Hope this may help you.
Complex split pot semantics for multiple All-In winners with differing amounts,"There have been several posts already here explaining how to compute side-pots (note that the subject of penalty blinds has not been dealt with but that is another topic). Here's one such topic: How are side pots built? Question. Is the ratio against the total pot... or the other winners?
  Is this correct? Get a ratio compared to others? The question doesn't make much sense because you're not expressing side-pots as a ""ratio"" of the total pot.  That is not how pots, pots winnings, pots rake and ""pots-splitting"" are computed.  You're never expressing winning as a ratio of the total pot. What you do is you compute exactly how many pots and side-pots there are and see which players are eligible for which pot. In your example, there are exactly three pots: pot 1: 29  (pot one could also be called the ""main pot"") pot 2: 6 (pot two could also be called ""side-pot 1"") pot 3: 4 (pot three could also be called ""side-pot 2"") The sum of all these pots gives the total pot (39). Pot 1 has 29 because player 4 is eligible for up to ""6"".  How many players did put up ""up to 6""?  Five players.  Four of which who did put 6 in and one of them  (player 5) who did put 5 in.  This gives 6 * 4 + 5 * 1. having gone all in with 6 units to win back less than 7 is a bit
  questionable That would indeed be questionable.  Thankfully this is not at all how it works.  Player four wins back 29, so he's making a net win of 23 (29 - 6).  You can also get that 23 by computing: 3 players matching up to 6 (18) + one player matching up to 5 (18 + 5, gives the net win of 23). Pot 2 has 6 units because it's 2 * 3.  You can verify this by checking how many players can match up to 8 (there are only three players who can do that), and then remove what already went into pot 1.  Three players did put more than 6 in, so you have 3 * 2. Pot 3 has 4 units.  There are two players who can match up to 10.  Once you remove from their stack what already went into the two other pots, this leaves 4 unit in the last pot. Player 4 has the best hand and wins 29 (+23 net) Player 3 has the second best hand and wins back pot 2, which only has 6.  So although player 3 is a ""winner"", he's making a net of -2  (he did put 8 in but only got 6 back).  This is normal because he's ""winnning"", but he's still beat by player 4. Players 1 and 2 do split the remainder (pot 3), which has only 4 units.  So they each get back 2 out of their 10 (net loss: -8). Player 5 did lose its 5.  Net loss: -5 Which gives: Which adds up to zero and which is normal since in the absence of rake poker is (chip-wise) a zero-sum game. As a final note, I'd advice to use as few decimal computation as possible when implementing an online poker client: the last thing you want are approximation errors. The only tricky case is when players are splitting a pot.  In some cases there are no issue (like above, where two players share an even pot), but in other cases you may have problems.... For example if three players are sharing a pot that has 8 cents (can happen at micro-limits).  In that case two players must get 3 cents back and one of them must get 2 cents back (giving 2 / 2 / 4 would be a mistake).  There's simply no way around that and as far as I know the player who gets only 2 (while the two other gets 3) is randomly chosen. But, once again, trying to express each pot as a % of the total pot is a recipe for approximation errors so don't do that. Moreover, in every single case, no matter how many pots there are, the exact amount of every single pot can be precisely computed, down to the cent. Note that there may be edgy cases, like what you should do when a player posts a ""penalty blind""...  Basically it's chips you did put in, but contrarily to any other chips you did put in, it does not really count towards determining the various pot sizes (besides the fact that the penalty blind is added to one of the pot)."
Whats your move on this hand?(KK) High Level Table,"it feels like the flat pre is likely to be a mid pair, broadway or suited connectors, the donk postflop is confusing makes me lead to the conclusion of weakness, because that range hes either on a draw or hes set mined and hit. I'm inclined to call, will update this if you post more information on what happened next. I dont think you can fold now. If you think he has any bluffs here I think you have to call. You also have good equity against two pairs. Against a set or straight you are pretty dead. But you have almost half of your stack in there already. I'm going to make a crying call.... wishfully hoping for something like j10...... realistically being alright with something like 78........but wholeheartedly expecting something like 77. tough spot but I think it's a call now."
Cash Game situation,"Given your description of villain, I think your play is OK but a call might be better.  A flush draw is a huge part of his range here.  The problem with raising him all in though is that he's getting a pretty good price to call with just a flush draw.  If you were to call instead of raising, then the majority of turn cards would result in one of two situations: A) the card is a blank and you can now bet large enough where he would be making a mistake to call (or he aggressively bets it himself in a poor position) or B) the turn is a diamond and you can possibly get away from the hand.  Either situation looks to be comparatively positive for you versus going all in on the flop, so that's the route I would go."
Should I call 3 bet when having two pair?,"One of the troubles with this hand is you can't narrow his range pre-flop. He's seeing a lot of flops anyway and since he's defending his blind his range will likely be even higher than normal. Pre-flop he can have almost any hand.  FLOP
He raises your strong looking 3/4 pot bet and you call. Since he is aggressive (from his pre-flop stats at least) it's a fair call to make - see what he does next. It looks like he's flopped a fairly big hand (KX+) and is trying to give draws a bad price. At this point you can put him on any  2 pair, a set, TJ/AQ/AJ spades, any king, or a bluff. Unless you think he has a lot of bluffs (which may be the case), his current range beats you. It's fine to call and see if you can take the pot later though. TURN
You hit your two-pair and decide to do a small check raise on the turn. I don't mind this because you think you're ahead and he's likely to continue with pretty much all of his range, you don't get any new information though. You are pretty confident you're ahead: all of his king pairs are behind, as is K3/93 and his bluffs will continue too. Of course, K9, big spade draws and sets get there too so you can't be too confident.  Raising his bet looks strong, given the possible flush out there so it's hard to see many of his bluffs putting you all in. A pair of kings probably folds (or maybe calls if they hold a spade), sets probably call, as might two-pair (at least given the raise size). I would say the only hands he re-raises you all in with here are flushes or stone cold bluffs (hard for him to pull off in this spot). As it turns out he seems to have sensed weakness and put you all in with only top two - probably not a profitable play for him! Regardless, at this point you need to think if he's likely to be be bluffing as much as 35% of the time. Given that you put him on the same range you did on the flop, he's unlikely to try and turn much of that range into a bluff and it's pretty unlikely that he makes this particular 3-bet bluff with air. Sensibly you won't be getting anywhere near 35% pot odds required to call so you must fold.  Other than that you're play seems good. The small check raise isn't bad since you think you're ahead so why not get some more money in while you can? I'd probably prefer a call on the turn and keep his weaker hands betting on the river, or even leading on the turn might be better to see where you're at. Not a lot in it though just don't make that call!"
"Heads-up river, first to show mucks. Does second player have to show to win pot?","No the second player does not have to show his hand. If a muck is allowed than he does not have to show. This should again be written in the  ""house rules"". 
In some Casinos every hand has to be shown at a paid river. Last action shows first. Calling is not an action. So the guy who bets / raises lasts should show first. But if he is allowed to muck his hand, why shouldn't apply the same rule for you after taking the pot? ;) "
Hand discussion: QJc vs A8o on A84 T K,"While you were definitely lucky in the hand, I think you played it ok preflop. A raise on the button with QcJc seems like a standard play to me (calling is probably fine as well). The flop is great for the opponent. I think the check from the villain is fine as you will most likely continuation bet. Once you bet 423 into a 600+ chip pot I think the villain should probably go ahead and go all in. The pot has over 1000 in it now and the villain has around 2600 in his stack. If you fold he increases his stack by 38%. If you have a hand such as AK, AQ, etc you would have a hard time folding top pair good kicker in this situation. If you have a hand such as KK, QQ, JJ, etc. he's potentially losing an extra bet by raising here. I would still raise all in as it is more likely you have an Ax type of hand. On the turn the villain has to determine whether to check or to show aggression for the first time. I don't the villain has enough information to determine if you will fire another bet again. Similar to the flop I think he could expect a bet from you if you have Ax, and maybe a high pair. If you have nothing at this point you will bluff an unknown percentage of the time (to get hands such as 99, 66, 98, etc. to fold). If I'm the villain I would have bet here as there are a lot of scare cards on the river that kill the value of A8 such as a K, Q, J, 9, etc. Once the K hits the river there are many hands that are helped by your range. It really depends on what range you have been put on to determine if betting out is a good play here for the villain. You could easily have AK, AQ, KQ, JJ, JT, AT, or a number of other random hands (such as your QJ). A8 beats some of these and loses to most. The villain bets 29% of his stack to find out (780/~2600). The problem with this bet is what hands are you going to call that he can beat? Probably only AQ, KT, and rarely AJ. I think the villain would have been better served to check again at this point and give you the opportunity to bluff. Overall though I agree that the opponents biggest mistake was playing the two pair so passively on the flop and turn."
Position when joining a Texas Hold'em table,"If you're approaching a game already in progress, you've got a few different scenarios: 1- Open seat is one spot after current big blind -- If you sit here, you will be the big blind on the next hand and no one pays double blinds.   2- Open seat is between current small blind and current big blind.  -- If you sit here, you can either sit out the next hand, or you can ""buy the button"" by posting a big blind and tossing a small blind into the pot.  Therefore no one pays double blinds.   3- Open seat is between current small blind and current button. -- If you sit here, the button will simply jump over you on the next hand so that no one pays double blinds. Casinos have different rules about whether or not a new player has to post a big blind before they can get their first hand.  At my local casinos, you have to post if you're moving from a different table, but don't have to post if you're new."
Nash's ICM calculation,"This is pretty complex question and proper answer is worth a chapter in book 
(Try Collin Moshman's SNG strategy it's a must read for every sng student.) Usage  No one ever solved Nash equlibrium for such complex game as poker, if such strategy was found, it would be unbeatable strategy. (Not most profitable though, because its static strategy and doesnt involve adjusting to our opponent play.) We are able to calculate strategy for simplier variant of poker. In this simple variant, every player has to decide, whether he want to go all-in or fold preflop. No other moves are allowed. Because this simple variant differs so much from hold-em poker(which involves planning our strategy for multiple streets, weightening outs, counting pot odds... ), we can use this strategy only in situations, when our optimal play will likely no differ from optimal play in our all-in/fold simplified variant. 
Nash is therefore used just in HU when effective stacks are <12 (some authors claim its -EV and recommend playing nash when effective stacks are <8) or in SNG, usually during bubble play and all-in/fold phase. (3-5 players on 9max, 2-4 players on 6max) I recommend reading Merseneary free e-book for more advanced and deep discussion about this topic. Theory I think Soner Gonul explained this well and I would just copy him. Great tools to practice Can be found here Understanding output of calculators I will refer to one instance of calculation.

Can A Qualifying Low Hand Also Win The High Hand Pot?,"Yes. Firstly, your hand has to qualify as being a low hand. Qualifying five-card poker hands must have no pairs in there, and also has no card higher than an eight. As a player can only (and must) use two cards from their starting hand, there have to be at least three community cards available that are also no higher than an eight. Flushes and straights are ignored in low hands, so your friend could indeed win the low and high pots."
Etiquette: Why is it rude to ask to see a mucked bluff?,"So I'll preface this answer with that as a former dealer I've always applied the rules and I've never really cared too much for what the players believe is the rules, or what is good etiquette around when cards get mucked. Let me first just post the WSOP rule from 2019, which while not universal across all tournament spaces it's often referenced and or inspires other rule sets adopted by many tournaments, which I think is actually extremely fair when it comes to the above situations for mucking hands. Importantly this rule also clarifies you're entitlements too. The above rule really eliminates and clarifies the expectations of players during showdown situations, especially where a participant refuses to show their hand, i.e. they're penalised. So in terms of why it's considered bad etiquette, this is my opinion, is because you're high-lighting someone's mistakes. The reason why I say this is I often believe it's either one of four reasons why a player doesn't want to show; I'm sure most players throughout their careers playing have been in both situations at one point in time, that it has essentially become an unwritten rule, i.e. etiquette, to just tap the table and let the player get away with not exposing their hand. In a sense I believe it's bad etiquette as people often become defensive when they've done something silly and if they can hide their mistakes they will do so, and by you not allowing it, thus people attach the dreaded 'bad etiquette' phrase to it. Exactly as you said, as it is completely reasonable, I have no issues if a player requests to see my hand when I'm playing, in fact I will just show it during showdown if I was the last aggressor and or the first to act in the betting round when checked down, i.e. I always apply the rule above.  Anyway TL;DR I believe it is considered bad etiquette as people become defensive of their mistakes and you're essentially forcing them to expose that mistake even though they've already said you win. Or in a phrase 'let sleeping dogs lie'."
What is overlay?,"Google   Wiki In poker, an overlay is the gap between a poker tournament's
  guaranteed prize pool and the actual prize pool generated by entrants. For example, if a tournament has a guaranteed prize pool of $10,000, a
  buy in of $100 and 90 players enter, the players will contribute only
  $9,000 to the prizepool. The rest of the prizepool (in this example
  $1,000)—made up by the tournament host—would be the overlay for the
  tournament."
How do poker sites detect bots?,"From what I know they track certain metrics to determine bots. Most bots are pretty damn weak but as individuals are often hard to detect. What they track tend to be the following: In general bots are used in conjunction with other bots, and when they're used together it becomes easier to track. They track stats and trends in general. Like for example if at micro stakes, the average player will raise 6% of the time, now imagine you have several 'players' who are opening 25% of the time. It's likely not a coincidence."
"In a tournament if you walk away from the table when ""all in"" did you ""abandon"" your hand?","""A hand may be considered and mucked if player is not at his seat"" - WSOP rules. This is hand abandonment. ""At his seat"" is defined as touching or in reach of one's seat. However, this rule only applies in a situation where your hand can be mucked.  It is not possible to fold when you are all-in for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is it would make collusion quite easy and there is never a reason to fold all-in. Due to this rule, a player cannot abandon his all-in hand as they do not have the option to fold. You were correct. Good job!"
Is there statistically any combination worse than 2 7 offsuit for preflop Texas Hold'em?,"I once spent an afternoon analyzing 7-2 with Poker Probe (An old program by Mike Caro). I was curious if there was any situation that justified making a call with 2-7. PP was a pretty simple program, you could run a hand against a configurable hand, or a number of random hands. It for example could tell you how often a particular hand would hold up against a particular number of players. It did not account for anything but the cards. My conclusions at the time about 2-7 where pretty much the obvious, it should never be played. 2-7 even suited has such a low rate of return that it simply should never be played. The more players in a pot the lower the EV is with the hand.  The only situation I could find were you could actually place a chip in the pot and get a slight positive EV on that chip was when your were against one opponent and could get five to one on that chip. If the blinds are ten and fifteen, and you are in the small blind you have a slight positive EV for the five dollar call when head up, if there is another limper in the hand the EV goes negative for the five dollar call. This EV is so low, just a very low percentage like 2 or 3 percent that factors like rake and the bad position your in, the possibility the BB raises, make it a negative play. Even in a time game the time you waste playing the hand might eat up any positive EV. I looked at a lot of hands and none play as bad as 2-7 against a large field. However that really is not an answer to your question because 2-7 has an advantage over a lot of hands like 5-3, 6-4, 3-4, and other hands that may play better then 2-7 against a larger field. I think it is safe to say that when compared to all other hands, that 2-7 is the most unplayable hand in poker. Being the lowest possible unconnected two cards the hand never gets the number of outs as even two smaller cards that are a little more connected.  "
How is players raising each other indefinitely prevented?,"Poker is typically played ""table-stakes"" which means that a player cannot bet more money/chips than is setting on the table in front of him. The only thing that would prevent infinite reraises between two determined players is one (or both) running out of money to bet. In heads-up play, as soon as one player goes all-in and is called (or calls all-in), the betting is over, the dealer deals the remaining cards for the hand and the players show their hands and the high hand wins. (Actually, the players' hands are typically shown as the last call is made, but I don't think this is required.)"
Knowing whether to continue after calculating outs percentage,"So just to offer you a small bit of clarity on outs, you absolutely do not have a 35% chance of winning the hand! You have a 35% chance of improving your hand. This is an important distinction to remember because; Often improving will give a winning hand, especially with things like flushes, but it's important to remember the above and that outs don't always equal your chance to win. So to me your main question here is once you've worked out your improvement probability what do you do next? As I often say in my answers on this SE, it really depends on many factors. However with that said some good guidelines as your next steps would be; To be honest there is no absolute 100% do this every time answer. With that said the above points I hope will highlight to you some things you should ask yourself and consider before you act. I think it's really important to remember if you're not thinking you're gambling, and if you can't explain why you did something with some degree of depth (especially when starting out, get into a good habit now of building a good mental process to decision making) you're making a mistake. It's ok to be wrong, it's ok to have a bluff fail, it's ok to try a play and it doesn't work, but it's really important you understand why you attempted it all."
Over pair in position,"First you should consider villain's range. Jacks or higher pair would probably raise, so at best they have pocket 8's, but they would be better off check raising in this spot. I'd discount J8 and 2s, due to the stack sizes. It's more likely they have some sort of draw, such as T9s or QTs, or a pair and backdoor draw, JTs, A8s, etc. With the stack sizes, I would raise here, to about 9BB, which should be about the size of the pot, and be willing to go all-in if they re-raise.  I'd be wanting to get it all-in on almost any turn, except a J or 8."
How to play if you hit a straight on flop?,"This is really just a comment on your turn play. Short version: After you check and he bets, I think you should have shoved all-in. You don't say exactly what the stacks were to begin the hand, but since you say they were greater than 100 bigs, I'm guessing they were closer to 100 than 200+. You called his pre-flop reraise and played the flop and turn quite passively when he was shoving money into the pot. His turn bet wasn't a bluff. After his turn bet (assuming a 100 bb starting stack for both players), he has put 61 bb into the pot and has 39 behind.  When you call here, you also are left with 39, when the pot is 123. You could have pushed all of that on the turn and there's no way he was folding.  Even if you both started with 200 big blinds, then you only have about one pot-sized bet remaining after his turn bet, so shoving here if you'd started with 200 bb would also not be absurd.  With the combination of his aggression on every street so far and his potentially feeling he's priced in even if he's beaten, he would have called your turn shove."
"What does ""across"" mean in poker?","In ""n across,"" n refers to the number of pips on one side of the card for cards that have more than one column of pips. So, the 4 and 5 would be ""2 across"" cards; the 6, 7 and 8 would be ""3 across"" and the 9 and 10 would be ""4 across.""  In the clip you linked in your edit (which was very helpful for reminding me of the answer, thanks!) they were both excited because there was a fraction of a second where they realized the river was a 4-across card but didn't know which, and it mattered. The 10 would seal it for Doyle, while the 9 would make Dwan's straight."
Nut flush draw shove,"On a strict mathematical basis, no, this is not a good play. You are getting 1-1 odds on your money when you need more like 2-1 just to break even.  However, you can introduce fold equity into this line of thinking. Fold equity in a nutshell: if you can get opponents to fold, then your hand/odds/draw don't matter nearly as much.  So the part that I would change is the check on the flop. I would absolutely shove on that hand. First, that board is going to miss quite a bit of people's ranges. You could also push something like a weak Q off that hand with a shove. Second, the initial, early shove shows a lot more strength than a check-shove, which can be an akward play in this spot. The goal is to put your opponents into question for all their checks; if you let them put some money in already (like after your check) then they feel ""priced in"" and your fold equity is a little lower than what it could otherwise be. Worst case scenario, they call you and you're very much alive in the hand - there's basically nothing that has you dead to rights on that board. Best case scenario, you take down a good pot right on the flop."
Do odds depend the the number of hands folded preflop?,"Assuming you know nothing about the cards dealt, they don't matter, so the 66% holds up. In most calculations we would just ignore the folded cards since we don't have any definite information about them. If you want to factor them in, you can no longer calculate your exact pot equity, since you don't know how often your opponents are folding hands like Ax, KT, and K9, (and this would also depend how the betting played out preflop). You can infer that the probability of any of your opponents having had hands like AA, KK, QQ, AK, AQ is slim, so you can expect there to be a very slightly increased probability of A's, K's, and Q's appearing on the board than you would expect if you had no additional information. This means that the KJ has a slightly increased chance of hitting a straight, however this will have a pretty small impact on your probability of winning with JJ. In fact, hitting his straight will allow you to chop if he has paired his K, so the improvement to his hand by factoring in the folded cards is even smaller. It is almost always the case that factoring in the folded cards will have a very small impact on your pot equity, and it is impossible to measure exactly unless your opponents are playing like robots and you know their exact hand ranges. For these reasons, it is usually impractical to do so."
"I lost and i dont get why, can any one help?","The king on the river gave your opponent two pair, kings and nines. It also changed your best hand, giving you two pair, kings and nines. Your opponent had a queen kicker, which plays on this board and is the sole difference between your hand and your opponent's. In hold-em, the best hand is determined by the best 5-card combination of cards for each player at showdown. Your opponent's best 5-card hand here: K♠K⋄9♣9♠Q⋄ Your best 5-card hand: K♠K⋄9♣9♥4♠ Had the board not paired on the river (and as long as the river is not a queen), you would have won this hand with your two pair versus your opponent's one pair of nines."
Player with 3 cards in Texas Hold'em. Now what?,"The hand should proceed, and UTG+3's hand should be declared dead. The answers that say this is a misdeal are flat out wrong. So much action has already happened in the hand that it makes absolutely no sense to declare a misdeal unless you're using some very particular (and bad) house rules that everyone has had access to. In particular, in Robert's Rules of Poker, Section #3.""Misdeals"".#2 states:
""[...] action is considered to occur when two players after the blinds have acted on their hands. Once action occurs, a misdeal can no longer be declared. The hand will be played to conclusion and no money will be returned to any player whose hand is fouled."" Section #3.""Dead Hands"".#1 states  ""Your hand is declared dead if:
[...]
(d) The hand does not contain the proper number of cards for that particular game"" So, as we see, UTG+3's hand should be declared dead, and play should proceed."
How much must Hero bet for Villain to fold?,"The only thing you can do is call. You've labelled Villian as tight-aggressive and he's made a small reraise after you've opened under the gun. This is a fairly strong sign of strength. Let's look at your options: Jamming: KQs is doing badly against the average TAG players range in this spot. Even if you give him a generous range of {99+, AJs+, AQo+, KQs}, KQs has 32.42% equity against this range. He isn't folding enough of that range to a jam to justify doing so. Reraising Not-All-In: This is a bad idea. The majority of his range will jam if you reraise at which point you'll have to fold, giving up a significant pot. The rest of his range will likely call and go to a flop. Note that his calling portion isn't doing so bad against KQs either.  Calling: You flat his raise and go to a flop. The total pot is $58 and you only need to call another $15, giving you 3.87:1 odds; a very tempting proposition. Note that you'll have to play this hand out of position against a very strong range. You are giving excellent reverse implied odds in this situation. If your postflop skills are good you should be fine though. Folding: This is definitely an option. It really depends on just how tight Villian is. If he's extremely tight I would fold this without a second thought.  So, the process of elimination only truly leaves you two options: call or fold. If you are fairly confident he's not a nit, see a flop.  I'm sensing a flawed thought process here. You do not want Villian to fold QQ on the flop. You should be betting for value, not as an attempt to fold out his hand. You don't want to fold out the portion of his range you're beating. You want to extract chips from him. I would personally never be betting this flop. You're out of position against an opponent that 3-bet your UTG open preflop and you've flopped TPGK which is still very vulnerable against Villian's range. He either has you crushed right now or has a hand that is scared due to the King.  Take a step back and think what leading out accomplishes. You simply fold out {AQ, AJs, QQ-99} a certain amount of the time (how often is dependent on how tight he is) and you valuetown yourself against {KK+, AK}. It's unlikely that Villian will fold to any flop bet with QQ, apart from a jam, and especially not against a $30 bet into a $73 pot. That means you will have to barrel the turn to push him off his hand which I just can't see happening with such short stacks. And that would be a terrible line to take as his range is very strong. You might as well just hand him your stack. Consider checking. This way Villian will likely continuation bet his entire range, {KK+, AK} as well as the hands you're beating, {AQ, AJs, QQ-99}. And if he doesn't, you can be reasonably confident that he doesn't have {KK+, AK} and then you can bet the turn/river for value against {QQ-99}. Your hand is relatively weak when compared to your opponents range but it is too strong to entirely give up on though. When you are in this kind of position, you should think of your hand as a bluffcatcher.  To answer your question entirely, if I for some reason decided to lead the flop here I would still bet $30 as you did, but for a completely different reason: for value. $30 bet into a $74 pot on the flop and then jam the remaining effective $85 on the turn when the pot is $134. If I was going to try to push him off {QQ-99} I would just jam the flop (but I can think of literally no situation I would ever do that). ~$50+ when facing a tight-aggressive player that raised UTG, smooth called a small reraise, and then donk-bet 2/3rds pot on a super dry K52 rainbow flop. Tight-aggressive players just aren't doing this with worse than Kx. If he had {QQ-99}, he'd likely just check-call one or two streets. He also might be donk-betting with Ax hands that missed but it's such a small portion of his range you can usually ignore it, especially when you consider that most people won't continuation bet 2/3rds pot with air. They'll c-bet around half pot or slightly less. If he donk-bet less, say $30-$40, I'd call one street and reevaluate on the turn. In this scenario, once I've hit my set I'm getting it in. Any non-Queen turn I would give up if he continued betting and if he didn't I'd check behind. Same on the river. This changes drastically if you can't label your opponent as tight-aggressive. If he is even remotely loose, I'd be getting it in with QQ on K52 rainbow every time, every day. I'd never be folding."

Chances of 5 way chop (flush board),"TL;DR Given a flush on the board, five players will split 19.7% of the time, or about once every 5 hands.  Given a fresh deal, the deal will come up with a flush showing and a five-way split 0.0389% of the time, or once every 2,569 hands. Overall odds that none of the five players have a given suit (say, hearts): Overall odds that none of the five players have a given suit (say, hearts) and the board also has a flush of that suit (i.e., when you don't know whether the board will turn up with a flush): Overall odds that the board has a flush in any suit, but none of the five players have a card from that suit: Odds that none of the five players have a given suit (say, hearts) when you already know that the board also has a flush of that suit: This seems like it should be our answer, but we have to do some more math in second major section below. For example, it's possible to have a flush on the board and have one or more players have a card in that suit, but still chop because their card(s) are too low to play. Figuring out the odds of a split pot given a flush on the board is much trickier. For example, if the board is A♥K♥Q♥J♥9♥, then the question is: what are the odds none of the players has the T♥? Obviously, any player with T♥ would win with a straight flush. Likewise, if the board is A♥K♥Q♥J♥5♥, then there's still a chop even if someone has the 4♥, but not if they have the 6♥. Here's how we calculate this: We need to know the odds of each of these outcomes. For example, if we know the board has a flush, what are the odds it's a 10-low (straight) flush? A 9-low flush? etc. So, the odds of a split given a flush on the board are: So, the answer is that the probability of a 5-way chop when there is a flush on the board is .19653, or about 1 every 5 hands. Note: technically, I have oversimplified very slightly here. It's possible for a player to have an in-suit card higher than the lowest card on the board and still get a chop, because the board could be a straight flush. For example, a player holds A♥ and the board is T♥9♥8♥7♥6♥ -- it's still a chop. The math here gets to be a pain, however, and has a very, very tiny impact on the overall calculation, so I've skipped it for simplicity. Some back of the envelope calculations puts the change at around 0.17% (P=0.001750364), or an additional 1 hand per 571, making the total probability 0.19828, or still around 1 in 5 hands. We're almost to a general answer of the question, ""How likely is it that a hand will have a flush board and split?"" The answer is: In other words, starting from a fresh deal, approximately one hand in every 2,569 will be a five-way chop with a flush on the board."
"What are the overall odds of winning a heads up, texas hold em hand?","As you can imagine, your equity in a heads up hand with no rake, where you bet preflop and deal out all community cards without betting, will be 50%.  Other variations of this, such as the dealer winning ties or the introduction of a rake, will lower your equity (and since this is a casino game, I'm willing to bet that they have something in their favor).  Having the ability to bet/fold gives you an opportunity to make better / worse decisions based on your hand, which will also affect your equity. As far as your odds of winning with two random heads up hands, you will tie just over 4% of the time, and you will evenly split the wins the rest of the time, over the long run.  This means that you will win very close to 48% of the time, assuming that you always go to the river. In order to provide strategic advice for a casino game, you would need to provide all of the rules of the game, because they can make a huge difference."
"What is the protocol for dealing the ""draws"" in ""draw poker""?",Draw (high and low) has been played in California clubs for many years with 8 players. Cards are dealt to the players who are drawing until the deck is exhausted (this does not happen very often). Then the discards are shuffled and a card is burned and the remaining players who are drawing get their cards from this shuffled set of discards.
Doubt in expected value calculation of Bill Chen book,"The calculations given in your example make sense.  Except you write 53/44 when you should have written 35/44 I believe. In the case that player A checks,  the expectation value of profit will be: <(A)>=(35/44)*400 + (9/44)*0 = (35/44)*400 = 318 In the case that player B bets $60, and player A calls, the pot increases to 400 + 60 + 60.  The expected total income from player A is therefore: Expected Income = (35/44)*(400 + 60 + 60) + (9/44)0 = (35/44)(400 + 60 + 60). However player A has to wager an additional $60 in this case, regardless of the outcome.  Therefore the expected PROFITS is thus, <(A)> = Expected Income - bet = (35/44)*(400 + 60 + 60) - 60 = 353. Alternative approach: Expected Profits in case of win = 400 + 60 + 60 - 60 = 460 Expected Profits in case of loss =  - 60 Therefore expectation of profits = (35/44)*460 - (9/44)*60 = 353 Explanation as to why approaches give the same answer: The first approach gives the formula, <(A)> = (35/44)*(400 + 60 + 60) - 60 Which is the formula used in the second approach."
How to play online horse tournament when you lack knowledge in one of the games?,"The obvious answer is to practice and study in the game that is your weakness. You've noted that you're already doing that, which is certainly a good step. That said, you will always have some games that are more of a strength than others. My solution is, quite simply, to play extremely tight in the game(s) that you are weak in. By only playing strong starting hands, you will face fewer tough spots in your weak games. Then you can use the games that you are good at to ""play poker"" (i.e. exploit weaknesses in your opponents, make plays, etc) and amass chips.  The only place this falls apart is if you end up playing in your weak game while holding a short stack. There, your stack is going to do so much to dictate your play that you will have to take some chances when situations call for it. This, however, should be an area that you're reasonably well-equipped to handle, since you have a good background in related games. That is, because of your related knowledge of other stud games, you should be able to spot typical stud stealing spots, and have enough starting hand knowledge to know what's good enough when you have to make a desparate move."
How to maximize expectation with pocket aces and an Aces Cracked bonus running,"Since this is limit holdem, the maximum pot for this scenario is $355, of which you can invest a maximum of $69 (after a forced blind post). Hence you will never win less than $200 - $69 = $131 if you always bet/raise and are shown a better hand. However, it is still possible to play this hand suboptimally even if it's impossible to lose at showdown. Here's the optimal line: As you are favored on every street in the hand history you posted, your line up to the river is definitely optimal. On the river, your expectation for calling is (1 - x) * $70 + x($200 - $6) = $124x + $70, where x is how often you lose. Your expectation for raising is (1 - y) * $70 + y[(1 - z) * $76 + z($200 - $12)] = y($112z + $6) + $70, where y is how often your opponent calls and z is how often you lose when he calls (we've assumed he never reraises for simplicity). Hence your line is correct if $124x + $70 > y($112z + $6) + $70. If your opponent always calls and wins, the inequality becomes $124x > $118, making calling the best play if you lose the hand more than about 95% of the time when you do call. This is as simple as it gets without analyzing bluffing ranges etc. and is quite a bit more complicated and probably not worth doing for no limit games and limit games for which the pot frequently exceeds the bonus. (And for significantly larger jackpots, utility considerations come into play.) To summarize, if your opponent can fold a better hand to your reraise, which seems impossible here, reraising would be a clear mistake. As played out the dollar difference either way doesn't warrant being berated, and in general the optimal line for this game with the given bonus is given by the two rules above. EDIT: Fixed some calculations, and additional comments... Interestingly, the better the Aces Cracked bonus is, the more that skilled players draw from it; and the worse it is, the less that skilled players draw from it. In this case, then, the value of the promotional drop is worse than breakeven for the worst player at the table. (Think seven-deuce side bet in no limit.) The justification for #2 has an analog in no limit through fold equity on a draw, though it presents itself in the reverse manner of putting in money. That is to say, it's only correct to raise all-in on a draw as a pot-equity underdog if you have enough fold equity to cover the loss. In your case, you always have enough ""backup equity"" to cover the case when you are behind your opponent's range, but when you are behind with a greater frequency than your pot odds, you lose money on every additional dollar that goes in the pot even though it's deducted from a net gain. This is essentially a pot odds argument. You're obviously ahead on the turn since your opponent has more draws in his range than made hands better than yours. Without dissecting entirely, let's say you're a 2:1 favorite. You win roughly that portion of the pot and are compensated $200 when you lose. It's always going to be good to bet since your bet lays you almost 8:1. The key addition is that when you bet/raise as the favorite, you never bet out a hand which beats you - the strategy changes if this were not the case. Do whatever it takes to get to showdown, but do so passively as the pot underdog. There may be special cases where aggression as the favorite folds out a better hand, but this is mostly against overly cautious players or particularly scary boards. EDIT: Correction for multiway pots... My apologies, the above analysis is only good when the hand goes heads-up. The multiway case depends on the stakes relative to the bonus, which here I think ""trying to lose"" is a good basic strategy. Your preflop play is correct as you are unlikely to fold out players who stand to release your bonus, at the same time value raising if you happen to win the hand anyway. If you were not last to act, raising may be suboptimal. From the flop forward, I like playing the hand passively until the hand goes heads-up, after which you adopt the strategy I outline above (playing normal, good poker). I think Villain is correct about your mistake on the turn. I like a check on the river, planning on check-calling. Your reasoning is sound, and there is an off-chance you can gain a bet from a bluff. The ""trying to lose"" strategy has an analog in tournament poker bubble situations in which you can maximize your money equity by cooperatively checking down. To be a bit more thorough, on the turn your hand is 70% to win against Villains with assumed ranges of {any two clubs}, {pair plus straight draw}, {any nine}, and {a random hand}, of which the draws are about 26% chance to catch up. If we fold out straight draws half the time and all non-flush-draw hands, our bet wins us $6 * 70% + $200 * 23% = $50, whereas checking would win us $200 * 30% = $60."
How to calculate expected value if I go All-in before flop with AK offsuit,"If you know your post-flop equity, your cards are irrelevant to the calculation here. That said, we have one crucial bit of information that is lacking: what range of hands is your opponent reraising with preflop? If he reraises with 100% of his cards and then folds everything but AA/KK, then it's pretty easy to make this profitable. If he only ever reraises with AA/KK in the first place, then it will never be profitable. Once you have a judgement for the hands he is reraising-but-folding, you can plug it in to the equation for calculating your EV on a heads-up shove, as follows, assuming you both have $200 stacks: EV = (F% * $20) + (1 - F%) * ((.1848 * ($20 + ($200 - $11 [e.g. the amount your opponent has already put in the pot]))) - ((.8153) * ($200 - $6 [e.g. the amount you have already put in the pot]))) That's the equation to start from. But your question was about what stack size is needed to make this profitable. So to solve the equation, we need to make an assumption about how often he is reraise+folding. I'm going to say 75% for the example below, but that could be way too high for a lot of players. That's saying that there are 4 times as many hands that he reraises with preflop as there are combinations of AA/KK. For this to be accurate, you need to have a good idea of the actual frequency of his reraises. Using 75% as an example, and simplifying the equation a bit... EV = (.75 * $20) + (.25 * ((.1848 * ($9 + S$)) - (.8153 * (-$6 + S$))) Which can be simplified further to: EV = $15 + (.25 * ((.1848 * $9) - (.8153 * $6) - (.6305 * S$))) And then further to: EV = $15 + (.25 * -$3.2286) + (.25 * (-.6305 * S$)) And finally to: EV = $14.19285 - (.157625 * S$) We can then set EV to $0 to find the breakeven point: $0 = $14.19285 - (.157625 * S$) => .157625 * S$ = $14.19285 => S$ = $90.04 So, if your opponent is reraising 4 times as many hands as he will call your shove with, then a shove is profitable for any amount under $90.04. Replace the .75 and .25 in the second equation to give a starting point for solving for a different frequency of reraise vs call."

You'll need 22+ to cover quads when the board is paired, that also covers all full houses. Since straight flushes are covered, straights are as well. Any time a straight flush, quads, a flush, or a straight is not possible, the nuts is a set, and your pocket pairs have that. This range covers 16.1% of starting hands."
Can there be more betting after an all-in covering a min raise amount?,"According to the World Series of Poker No-Limit & Pot-Limit rules page, yes, player B has the option to reraise because it is just enough to reopen the betting round. All raises must be equal to or greater than the size of the previous bet or raise on that betting round, except for an all-in wager. A player who has already acted and is not facing a fullsize wager may not subsequently raise an all-in bet that is less than the minimum bet (which is the amount of the minimum bring-in), or less than the full size of the last bet or raise. (The half-the-size rule for reopening the betting is for limit poker only.) Example: Player A bets $100 and Player B raises $100 more, making the total bet $200. If Player C goes all in for less than $300 total (not a full $100 raise), and Player A calls, then Player B has no option to raise again, because he wasn't fully raised. (Player A could have raised, because Player B raised.) So, in this case: Player A raised to $2200
  Player B reraises $3000 to make the total bet $5200
  Player C calls $5200
  Player A reraises $3000 to make the total bet $8200 Thus, player A only needed to raise $3000 to open the betting round again — which he did."
How to choose new dealer when some new players have joined and some previous players have left the table?,"On the first hand, F6 is SB and A1 is BB.  Don't look where button go but look where BB go on new hand (rule of the dead button). Second hand, B2 is BB, A1 is SB.  Button is theoricaly at F6 (empty seat) and no player can enter betwwen button and SB, so Button stay in a empty seat and new players (G7 and H8) can't play this hand (no deal and no ante for them) Next hand, if no one leaves, C3 will be BB, B2 will be SB, A1 will be the Button, and everyone will play."
Do PokerStars take a cut when you cash out,"No, they don't take a cut of anything you cash in or out. They make their money from something called rake. In a cash game they'll usually take 2-5% if I recall correctly, up to X amount of dollars (it caps at some point). In tournaments a portion of your buy-in will be rake. For instance, consider the $1.10 micro-stakes big field multi-table tournaments on Pokerstars. $1 goes towards the tournament prize pool, $0.10, the rake, goes to PokerStars. Note that they aren't alone in this regard. Live, brick and mortar casinos do this as well. "

NL100: Turn Two-Pair at Wet Board Facing Small Bets,"93 hands is certainly a small sample, especially for 3betting statistics. At most he's probably had ~10 opportunities to 3bet. For VPIP/PFR its reasonable, but as you probably know its very easy to go 50+ hands without being able to open/flat/3bet/whatever.  The fact that villain is sitting with 40bbs is a pretty big indicator that he's a fish (or, at the least, that he's not a winning regular). The line he takes in this hand makes me even more confident in this analysis. When people take this sort of turn line it generally means that their hand improved in some way that allows them to think they're ahead. Basically, they don't want you to check back but they also don't want to scare you away.  I definitely call the turn because sometimes we're ahead, and when we aren't and draw out we stack him. On the river I don't think there's a big difference between folding and calling. We need to be good 27% of the time so I think it's pretty close. He doesn't seem like a maniac so I think it's a fold but in game I probably call a decent portion of the time, lol."
Tricky Tournament Bubble Situation,"Villain's range is weighted toward Qx given his lack of interest in maximizing fold equity, so you're something like 32% to win and being given 2730:1170 = 30%, slightly correct pot odds to call chip-equity wise. If you fold, your money equity via ICM is $411. If you commit, 32% of the time your stack will be 7,130 against 2,870, for a money equity of $585, and 68% of the time your stack will be 3,230 against 3,900 and 2,870, for a money equity of $327. Your money equity expectation for going with the hand is thus 32% * $585 + 68% * $327 = $410. This is about the same money equity as folding, if our range assumption is accurate. You really screwed yourself with the bet sizing. If Villain can have a flush draw this is a fold since those composed with Qx tip the money equity enough, and even if he doesn't have a flush draw his queen is a club a third of the time for a redraw on two of your outs."
Best way to play poker online for playchips,"Almost all legitimate sites offer some kind of play-chip option within their gaming platform. I know Pokerstars.com has one, and it gets a lot of traffic. Using software from sites that offer both play money and real money games will often have superior software functionality so I'd suggest going down that route. Also, there is another question that may be of use to you here."
Online vs live tournament pace,"The fundamental difference between live and online are: Live: Online: I won lately 2 live tournaments in a row +-130 players and +-220players  with 500$ buy in each  My strategy was simple since the blind level was 30 min i could play a decent poker and choose wisely my hands (30 min live = +- 15 min online)Early when blinds are low people tend to play more but after some point they getting tighter and tighter until at some point you know they only play KQ+ off (for most players) I build up my stack by stealing blinds and making some bluffs when i see a weak person.
After i got a good stack(30B+) i try to play suited connectors like 56 suited.
Try to avoid battles against some people unless you know you can win(don't bluff them). Problem is that if you get someone angry it will be harder in the table to steal blinds since everyone is watching every movement of you(because other guy is flaming you or whatever). Try to be a ghost or a spotlight it only depends on your play style."
Expected Value for SB und BB in NL HU (GTO),"I don't think anything is proven, not even that ev_sb >= 0, so the only bounds we have are trivial: -0.5 <= ev_sb <= 1. An easier question is ""What ev_sb do people find solving abstracted versions of HUNLHE"".  It would be be interesting to know the sorts of values people are getting, i.e. 1) The value of the (abstract) game from the SB's point-of-view, and state the accuracy of your solution - so if your solution is actually exploitable (within the abstract game) for 0.001BB/hand, say so. 2) The number of information sets in the game (give the combined total for both players). 3) The effectively stack size.  The OP only mentioned in 100BB but data for other effective stack sizes would be interesting too."
What do they call the players stacks of chips? Like his bank or somethin',You literally said it in your question :). It's most often referred to as their stack. Many will also just simply refer to them as their chips either.
Theory of Preflop Opening Ranges,"Disclaimer: I'm not good at poker. There's more to consider than raw equity when deciding which range to assign each hand to. This is because there are more rounds of betting, where certain types of hands will tend to surrender their equity more often than others by folding. Suited connectors, such as 98s, hit the most flops out of any type of hand, because they can flop straight draws and flush draws in addition to pairs. While they don't flop strong hands like top pair top kicker, they do flop outs. Even bottom pair is five outs against a bigger pair. These outs let you bluff more often, because you still have outs to win if they don't fold. These folds are where suited connectors make up for their lack of preflop equity. For example, a player holding 33 would not feel comfortable calling two streets on a board of 7-5-4-Q with two hearts and two spades, which it must do to realize all of its equity against 98s. While this is good, suited connectors don't actually often end up with strong hands on the river. Straights and flushes are not easy to make in this game. In a live low-stakes environment where you see a lot of showdowns, bluffing when your suited connectors catch a piece of the flop shouldn't be a large part of your strategy. You limit the number of bluffs you make is by playing fewer starting hands that tend to turn into bluffs. If you only play some of your suited connectors, it makes sense to only play the best, as in highest, ones. This author has chosen, rather arbitrarily, to limit his selection to 98s or better. He could have chosen a lower bound of 87s or 76s, and the reasoning would remain the same. Hands like KQo and AJo are not included in this range simply because they are not suited. The only two unsuited unpaired hands in the entire chart are AK and AQ. Generally, in live low-stakes poker where pots are large and action is often multiway, suitedness becomes important, because flushes are big hands capable of winning big pots. Hands like KQo make top pair with a good kicker often, but top pair with a good kicker does not get many streets of value out of position against four opponents. The value of hands whose primary strength is making good pairs, therefore, decreases in the kind of game the author is writing advice for. Finally, this does not look like a range based on modern solver work, and modern theory probably recommends against opening 22 under the gun. Rather, it is part of an exploitative strategy that targets a specific kind of game and player. This means there isn't much reason for why the range ends exactly where it does. You will not be committing a serious error adjusting the edges of this range to better suit your playing style, or to better suit the kinds of games you play in."
"Turn play on a wet board with top-top, flush and straight draw","I think you played it OK. K7 and Q7 seem pretty loose to me but if you are going to put K7 in his range then need to include Q7.  And put AK in his range.   KK, QQ, and JJ should raise pre flop  You are only behind KQ, KJ, QJ, K7, Q7, AT, and 77. Against two pair you pick up outs. Against K7 you have 3 aces, 9 spades, 2 queens, and 3 tens = 17. Against that hand you were getting odds to call if you check he pushed.  You were almost getting proper odds to call KQ.   Not sure pushing was good on the turn as any worse hand is going to fold out. AK is basically the bottom of your range. I think you should call if you check and he pushes the turn because there are bluffs and weaker draws in his range. If he checks back the turn and a blank hits the river then you have a chance to get away."
Can i fold my trips here?,"In poker, sometimes you can play everything really well, and still get screwed. That's what happened here. If you're folding that, you're playing the game way too tight, and you'll end up losing a lot in the long run. Even if you have the read that this guy was an extreme nit, he could've very easily played a similar way with Jx, AK etc. In which case, taking into account the number of hands you beat plus the amount of money already in the pot, it turns into a very good EV+ play. You played it right and got coolered. Bad beat."
All-ins and folds: what happens to folded money?,"In these types of all in situations, first identify the shortest stack that is all in--in this case 4k.  The main pot will include up to that amount for each player that participated in the hand.  If somebody puts in less than the shortest stack but ends up folding, that amount goes to the main pot.  If anybody matches what the shortest all in stack put in, that amount goes to the main pot (so in this hand, all of the 4k that player3 put in goes to the main pot).  And then for anybody who puts in more than what the shortest stack had, a portion of their total bet that's equal to the shortest stack goes to the main pot (so in this hand, for both player2 and player4: the first 4k of what they put in goes to the main pot).  There can be multiple side pots...imagine if everybody had gone all in for this hand.  For each successive side pot, things work similarly except that the second side pot contains everything that is contributed BETWEEN the smallest all in's stack (4k here) and the next smallest all in stack (would be 6k here).  Then you're left with whatever the last two players put in that's above and beyond the previous all in player's stack. Hopefully that makes sense.  To be clear for the example you gave, the main pot would be 16k and the side pot would be 4k.  "
Differences between playing microstakes and higher stakes,"You state you don't have much motivation playing micro stakes. 
I understand from your statement that what motivates you is the money gains.
They are indeed low at micro stakes. And every poker player would be happy to rank 1st at a tourney with a million dollar gain.
But what should motivate you is the game itself. If you see the game as a part time time job to make extra income you won't succeed. And you'd better learn another skill you can trade part time for money (build websites, sell food, sell home made handcrafts etc...).
If you are passioned about poker and focus on your game, play your A-game, as a result you will win (variance considered), and money will juwt follow.
You could try to play $1000 buy-in games, or $5/$10 CG, you would be playing with players who also lure the big money prizes, but who are very experienced and know what they do, and so going ITM would be much harder. Playing such higher stakes would be even more frustrating for you because you would lose much more money.
If you don't have any motivation playing micro stakes, it is likely you won't have any playing higher stakes."
Problem with a hand in Texas hold'em,"The point of hold-em is that your hand is the best possible five-card combination from all seven cards. So, in this case, yes, it is a split pot. All players (as you describe them) have a 6-high straight. That's the best possible hand, so that's their hand. "
Pot odds for chasing a flush against unknown opponent,"You remind me of a session I had with a poker coach. He had an interesting take on this same scenario and that's to go all-in on the flop - the call would be a ""mistake"". Your analysis is right on the odds, and yes, you would be frozen-out on odds if the opponent bet's 1000 into you. The thinking was to avoid the exact scenario you're describing. The all-in on the flop gets you (1) the potential that your opponent will fold & you will win on the spot and (2) you're essentially ""buying"" both 4th and 5th street. You're effectively closing out the potential of being priced out after the turn and making sure that you get two shots at making your flush. Otherwise, you're basically only getting 1 shot at the flush (the turn) which truncates the odds you just calculated. So, if the odds are there on the flop, make sure you get to see out the rest of the hand to 5th street. The only way to really do that is to shove on the flop. "
Equity calculation at brick and mortar poker,"When you say equity you automatically say equity against something, where something can be either a hand or, more likely, a range. On the other hand, the good part is that you don't need to calculate the equity to the last decimal. If you determinate your equity being 60% and your real equity is 65% nothing wrong is going to happen (not that I know of). Calculating (or guesstimating) equity can be improved greatly away from the table. You You cannot use PokerStove at a live table, but there are a few shortcuts: Hope my answer helps! Good luck."
Number positions in Poker table,"There may be a few instances that are relative to the setting in which they are used. The numbering, I'm confident, will always move in the direction in which game play progresses. I haven't seen, and doubt I ever will, anything other than that. Some examples... I haven't seen or know of any others than these."
combinations from 2 hole card and 7 communal cards,"Well, it's actually pretty easy. In Texas Hold'em you can combine them anyway you want. So the answer is yes, you can choose all the 5 community cards to form your hand1. In fact, in Texas Hold'em, the total number of ways you can combine the cards is: (7!) / ((5!) x (7 - 5)!) = (6 x 7) / 2! = (6 x 7) / 2 = 42 / 2 = 21. where n! = n factorial = 1 x 2 x 3 ... x n When it comes to Omaha (the only other poker variation that has community cards), things are a little more complicated, since you have additional restrictions (2 cards from your hand, 3 from the community cards, NO EXCEPTIONS). I'm not going to present the calculation in the case of Omaha here (it's a bit longer), but if you're curious the result is 60. 1 = you probably lost the hand at that point, I suggest bluffing :D"
NL100: Overpair vs Loose Passive @ Wet Flop. Is The Prior Action Relevant?,"Given the history you have with Villain, I think that we are pretty likely to be ahead here, as it sounds like he is doing this with a wide range. I suspect that with only 60 hands, we have no knowledge of how he plays his big hands (so we have nothing to judge whether or not he would take the same line with Top-Pair-Good-Kicker as with a straight), but since we know he will do this with as low as TPGK, I do not think folding is an option here. So we are left deciding whether to call or raise. A fair number of his TPGK hands have extra outs to the straight - a situation which we're still 60/40 ahead of, but which would lead him to commit to the hand. I have to suspect that our fold equity here is minimal as well. Overall the range I'm giving him is something like JJ-77,ATs-A9s,KTs-K9s,QTs-Q9s,J9s+,T8s+,97s+,87s,76s,ATo,KTo,QTo,J9o+,T9o,98o,87o, and perhaps a few weaker hands. We are right around even money against this range, and none of the hands that have us in trouble go away as a result of a raise. To me, that means there is little upside to playing a big pot here. The only thing that can happen on the turn to dramatically hurt our hand against his range is for a J or T to come. While we take a big hit in terms of equity if that happens, his small bets will likely make it still +EV to call, if we let that happen. So with all of that in mind, I call here, intending to play it passively for a cheap show down. I think we'll have better spots than this to get this guy's stack."
"In Omaha, Is it allowed to only show two holecards at showdown when claiming the pot?","I wish I could say that Robert's rules would cover this situation, ... Section 3, the Show down: ... but I've seen this rule ignored often in live games. I try to ask before I sit down so that there aren't any misunderstandings."
NL400: Live Hand vs Semi-Loose Passive Player At Dry Board. What Would You Do?,"I'd fold this hand PF. You are playing heads-up OOP with a hand that does not fare well against her range, and is unlikely to win any decent pots with the bare TP. You other actions are fine by me: The call on the flop: Folding here to the standard CBet would make no sense - what did you want to flop? And why wouldn't she bet a King dry flop with her entire range? You don't know if you are ahead or behind, but raising to find that out is too expensive when you can probably find that out by calling and checking and seeing what she does on the turn. Small hand small pot. The check on the turn If you are ahead here, it's unlikely that she will call anything with a losing hand - so it's better to make a value bet on the river, when she may make a crying call with a pocket pair to snatch the 'obvious' bluff. You don't fear much giving a free card here, because if she is behind, she probably has only 2 outs if she has a pocket pair, or 3 outs if she has an Ace; Maybe 5 outs if she has something like the 89s, but that's less likely. The bet on the river She has checked the turn and the river, and will suspect a bet from you may be a bluff - this is probably a good place for a thin value bet to extract value from a pocket pair. I'd probably fold if she raised here, but it would depend on the opponent."
What's considered an acceptable rake in tournaments?,"For online tournaments, the norm is roughly 10%. Sometimes less for high buy-in events. For low buyin live tournaments ($100 or less), a rake up to 25% isn't completely outrageous, as the casino has larger costs to cover. As the buyin gets larger, that should shrink substantially (a $200+$35 is pretty common). Events with over a $1k buyin should be back to a 10% max (for instance, WSOP circuit events have a $1500+$100 structure), and very large buyin events typically drop below that ($10k events typically in the range of 5% with-held for entry fees). In the specific example you give, that sounds high, but it still seems reasonable. There are a lot of costs that have to be covered regardless of the buyin level. I do agree that the rake at these stakes can be hard to beat, doubly so given the fast structure that low buyin live events typically see (as this results in more gambling, which can low your edge)."
"Is NLHE ""solved""?","I saw this and thought it was pretty cool, but I do not think poker is ""solved"". This AI works by playing a large number of hands against players, mathematically analyzing the decisions it made in those hands, and applying those analytics to future decisions in future hands. I personally do not think that this means that the AI has solved poker for a couple of reasons: This AI has only been able to master 6-max cash games against a small player pool. (Other AI's have been developed that can reliably beat top pros in heads-up play) It has achieved its level of play by learning, similar to how humans get better. This means that it will have a skill cap based on who it plays against because it will only be able to get good enough to beat them consistently. it will not get any better than that. If this AI plays against itself, I predict that it will reach a nash equilibrium fairly quickly because it will solely focus on playing perfectly optimally against itself, preventing the AI from being able to exploit itself in any way.  These are just my thoughts, and they probably have some kinks or exceptions involved. There is no doubt that this AI is very good at NLHE and it can most likely beat any player out there. I think that it has not yet solved the game though. In my opinion, the breadth of NLHE is much wider than chess or go because of all of the factors that must be taken into account when making a decision (of which there are very many). Things like exploitative play vs. GTO play, tournament strategies including ICM considerations, adjustments in larger games like 9-max games where players are constantly leaving and joining the table, and even information associated with live poker. "
Trip Aces vs Possible Flush,Pre not sure what a 3 bet to 6 bb accomplishes.  It has basically no fold equity.  You would need to 3 bet to 10 bb.  A6s is a good but not premium hand that wants to see a flop from middle to late position.  It is not good enough to want to build a pot.  OK with Flop and turn bets. On the river what hand do you think is going to call a shove. Based on his betting he does not have a set or a flush.  You should be trying to get value from like 7 or 72 with a small bet.  If he set you up slow playing a flush you are toast.
All in player exposes cards in multiway pot when action is not over,"Awhile back I was dealing a game in a small casino in Northern Nevada. A player was all in, and was insisting that he could turn his hand over if he wanted. I told him you can't, he said can to. I then told him if his hand was shown that I would kill the hand and he would have no claim to the pot. He mumbled and held his hand.  That is one way to handle it when the player just doesn't get it. Most of the time a player has a big hand and just gets excited and turns the cards up. Typically this is a new player and they don't understand why you should not. The player who insisted he could turn his hand up anytime he wanted after he was all in was a new player.  However if the player just keeps doing it thinking it is no big deal, start killing hands. But accidentally, and occasionally, when someone does not realize there are other players, let it go, it is no big deal. "
Revealing hand thinking bet was covered,"This was a terrible decision, and no competent poker floorman would ever have done that. The game is heads-up; a player has every right to show his cards at any time, and does not lose any privileges by doing so, because there is no third party to be affected. The dealer should simply have reminded the player ""you haven't called"", and been allowed to call (or fold)--assuming his opponent still had cards."
What is the difference between limit and no limit starting hand rankings?,"When the book was written limit hold'em was the dominate form of hold'em, with significant differences then the way the game is played today. No limit was a rare game. I worked at the mirage from 90 to 98, and dealt no limit once, to Stu Unger and another player. S&M at the time probably did not even consider much what the differences were, and if they did they considered them in the context of a no limit game without a cap on the buy-in, and not the super aggressive short stack way that it's played today. Keep in mind that hand rankings in the original form where based entirely on math, that is to say that AA wins X amount of time, KK wins X amount of times etc. Then when you start adding variables to this with the number of players and rank them by expected value, rather then just how often as a percentage a particular hand holds up against a particular number of random hands, the rankings of hands start to change. The first hand rankings were calculated by hand, as computers became available and more powerful the hand rankings have become more elegant. The S&M ranking you have was done late 80's, like 87 or 88, on best an old 286 or something rather tedious to program and run. It has been revised since. Consider a hand like AK against say a pocket pair like 99. The pair of nines is a better hand, has a better EV then AK whenever your playing head up with just one other player. I think it is something around 52% for 99, 48% for AK. That is a general number and varies a little bit with what suites each of the players hole cards are in relation to each other. You add another player to the mix with something like J-10, and the EV of 99 goes down roughly by half and the EV on AK goes up, AK wins at a slightly diminished percentage, but is now getting 2 to 1 on the money rather then 1 to 1, which makes AK fairly profitable in the three way pot, and 99 a loser with EV. (There are huge variables outside of the scope of just hand rankings, what the game is like, what your particular opponents are likely to do etc.) So one of the simple differences in a hand ranking for no limit is that the average number of players seeing a flop in a typical no limit game is lower then the average number of players seeing a flop for a limit game. IF I would venture to put a number on it I would say about 1.5 more players each hand see a flop in limit then do in no limit. The result at any rate is a general upgrading of the EV of pairs at the expense of the rating of A-Face hands for a no limit rankings. Keep in mind that the hand rankings, any hand rankings are just guideline. The particular S&M hand ranking your looking at from Texas Hold em for advanced players will suit a beginning player just fine as a starting point. Poker is not so much about hands, as it is understanding about when your particular hand is worth playing, and that is determined more by the variable of the hand your in on any particular round.  To demonstrate what I mean lets go back to 99 head up against AK. If you are the player with 99 and read someplace in a hand ranking that 99 is favored over AK head up, you may decide to always play 99 head up. So a player raises into you with AK and you call, determined to call all bets, because 99 is favored. You will have a negative EV, because the biggest variable is that smart players bets when he is ahead, folds when he is behind, and dumb players always call and check when unsure. 55 is better then AK head up in the hand rankings, but you need to be a really seasoned player to play fives head up profitably against AK, and how profitable those fives will be depends on how well your opponent plays. S&M from what I understand have revised their hand rankings over time. Don't know if these revisions made it into later reprints. There are also other rankings out there for no limit and limit. To me they are not a big deal, but great for beginners. There not gospel to any seasoned poker player. The main part of what a poker players learns through experience is to think critically about any particular hand to come up with the best EV for that hand, that kind of thing does not really fit into a hand ranking chart."
What kind of results are people getting with short stack strategies in no limit holdem?,"I mentioned the thread in R.G.P (rec.gambling.poker a news group) called ""Rose Colored Glasses"" about playing short. I tried to find archive  but could not. The title meant that the player playing short was seeing the game through rose colored glasses, meaning all the players had the same size stack as the player seeing the game through rose colored glasses. No player could beat him for more then he had, so no player at the table had a stack bigger then his. I think I read the thread at least twenty years ago, so what I do remember about the thread was long ago packed into my brain as things about poker, and not things about the thread and some of it may just come out as my thoughts on playing short. As I write I am still anxious to see if someone steps up with a good strategy for playing on the minimum buy in in a no limit game. No one has stepped up yet. Back in the late eighties there was a Pot limit hold'em game at the Sundance casino on Fremont street in Las Vegas. At the time almost every casino had a small poker room on Fremont Street. The game had 1/2 blind and a forty dollar buy-in. Four or five of us would sit around there with reasonable stacks of a few hundred. All night long players would come attack the game with the minimum buy in. Some of these guys would come back half a dozen times or more through out the night, taking that shot at the game. It was a turkey shoot, with few turkeys every surviving, and those that did would come back the next night and keep taking that forty dollar shot. For those of us that sat down with a reasonable amount of chips, it was a honey pot, for the rest of them it was poker death. Over the years I have seen players sit down with a minimum buy-in at limit games and no limit games. Some get lucky with their pushes and cash out a few hundred ahead, giggle and leave the table. Most just loose their short buy, try again then loose again. The basic thing about a player that sits down and buys in short, is that buy in tells you they are not a confident player. They are buying in short basically in order to pick up a premium hand then get there money in with it. They are doing this because the only part of the game they understand, and trust themselves to play correctly, is starting with a good hand. They are generally weak passive players that do not know how to bet a hand after the flop, and do not know how to laydown a loser, or are not able to figure out when they have a winner. They are weak players, that have just fallen into the short buy pattern from desperation. It is the only way they can get a little short term success. They usually fit the pattern of a degenerate gambler. This little rant is just based on my observation over the decades. On a different level, conjecturing about buying in short as a valid winning strategy I fail to see how a strategy where one throws away most of their positive expectation tools can be a winning strategy. It is akin to making fine furniture when your only tool is a chop saw. If you understand the chop saw metaphor you may be interested in:   So I looked at A fool proof strategy for wild games. To quote the article for the basic ideal: Indeed, that’s what makes this strategy “foolproof.” Your goal is to
  get your money in early with good hands so there are no tough
  decisions. You aren’t relying on your hand-reading skills or your
  creativity to give you an advantage; you’re relying on raw math. The premise here is a wild 2-5 NLHE with lots of fast loose play and lots of big stacks. The author is advocating a 300 buy instead of the maximum buy of 500. The basic play is to make a raise pre-flop with a rank hand then get it all in when you hit a flop.
So many questions come to mind when I read this. Why wouldn't 500 work better then 300?  Are math skills exclusive from other poker skills? Getting rid of creativity gives you an edge? Not considering tells gives you an edge? I would say that in the fast game the author described that the effectiveness and usefulness of some game skills are somewhat muted. But they are by no means irrelevant.  This is somewhat like a Martingale system in the sense that it shares a belief that moderating the size of the bet somehow changes the odds of the bet. Only the short buy concept also adds that if you dummy down your game by lowering your buy you have a ""Fool proof"" way to  win. Oh please! What a short buy really does is diminish some standard deviation at the cost of expectation. If you are a losing player this is a good thing, if you are weak in wild games this also is a good thing, for some even a good place to take a shot. But it is not a winning thing. It is not an optimal way to play. Even if you have success doing this you are not going to have as much success over the long run as an expert player with a bankroll.  Indeed buying short is more about bankroll then about winning strategy. If your worried about fast wild games and losing to much bankroll in such a game, you would do better to simply stay away from them. Buying short can never be an optimal way to win. It is definitely not worth considering to much for serious players as a way to improve their game. Ray I would not consider teaching this in a poker school as a serious subject. Just something handy to know so you can spot it and devise a tactic to kill the turkey."
Would someone adept at Online Poker be just as good at Casino Poker?,"IMO, ""free"" poker is not a close match to cash poker, even at the lowest cash levels. Free poker is great at helping players learn the mechanics of the game and basic gameplay, but it totally misses the behavioral aspects. People act differently when there's money on the line. If possible, try to find an online site that is available in your area and play at the microstakes level such as at the 1/2 cent blind levels. The microstakes levels are surprisingly different from free poker and more accurately mimic what you'd find in a $1/$2 live poker room table, and it's cheaper and easier to find out. I'm guessing that if you can reliably beat free poker in the face of all the craziness that happens there, you wouldn't be at all outclassed at a $1/$2 live game. The players will be a mix of skills and styles, but few if any of them will be good players. In the (paraphrased) words of Ed Miller: ""How do I know that none of the players in your local 1/2 game are any good? Because they're playing 1/2."" So don't be scared of them. Play within your bankroll limits, and you'll be ok. And yes, the rake will kill you. I don't know about the rake at your local casino, but $5 from each pot is not atypical, so that's a lot of money being sucked off the table each orbit. It's going to be hard for most anyone to reliably make money against that kind of rake over the long term. I love 1/2 in part because I feel like I have some edge over most opponents, and in part because it's just fun to sit and chat and compete and learn, and the fun is worth a few bucks in rake. Go to the poker room, sit down, have some fun, observe others, and try to learn and execute your strategies. What's the worst that could happen? Another good way to get your first card room experience is to find a local daily or weekly tournament where you can know up front that the buy-in is the amount of money you can lose."
MTT - flush draw vs loose big'o'stack,"Nothing jumps out at me as being obviously wrong with your play. I agree that the pre-flop shove is a good alternative but I wouldn't necessarily think that your move was wrong.  Regardless, you had a great draw and (unfortunately!) those draws aren't always going to work out. You got your money in good and your thinking is along the right lines. This is just one of those things where ""the rabbit had the gun this time"" :-)"
Teach poker in a home game,"I'm in exactly the same situation, down to every cruel aspect of it. It's actually quite amazing, something that people without knowledge of probability distributions would call a huge coincidence :D . I think the problem in your approach is the fact that you throw a huge amount of information at them. Texas Hold'em (and poker in general) is a game with a very big number of rules, including those for marginal situations (for example, think about side-pots). For example: When I first started with poker, I practiced alone for a few days the different hand combinations. I shuffled the cards and layed out the cards for 4 players face up, together with all 5 community cards. The goal was to minimize the time in which I correctly figured out which one of the hands is best. I did this hundreds of times until I was pleased with the result. What I'm trying to say is: figuring these things out takes time... in some cases, a lot. The way I would do it is one step at a time: The order of these topics and which one should be covered on which night is not necessarily set in stone. Make up your own little plan. Bottom line: no matter how you plan on teaching them, do it gradually. Throwing a lot of information at people will only frustrate them, which will make them give up the next time. If you do it slowly, they can accumulate the information more easily, which will make the experience more enjoyable."
Considering Weighted Ranges,"I like this question. In contrast to Bogdan, I think weighted ranges do make sense. To stay with this example (and for the moment, forgetting about the difference between checking and betting), the UTG player surely would play any AA hand he is dealt. On the other hand, he typically would sometimes play marginal hands (like in this position say 99) and sometimes fold them. So in his range, 99 is not represented with the full relative probability of this hand, but only with the fraction of it corresponding to his playing rate. Probably this is often neglected because"
What is the D on table and the terms defining players?,"The coin-like thing on the table is a marker used to indicate the player who is the dealer, and this marker is called the button or dealer button. The button circulates around the table in a clock-wise direction one player at a time after each completed game. Now in casino games, the player holding the button does not actually act as the dealer and deals the cards to each other players, instead an employee from the house does it. Since the player with this position is always the last to act thus giving the player an advantage, hence the rotating button is there to prevent cheating so that every player gets to take turns serving as dealer.  As for the terms you mentioned given to the players: Hope this helps"
Name of five card Texas Hold'em game?,"Where are you located ? - we have been playing this variant for the last 5-6 months in our local club WestPoker in Denmark. We have never seen or heard of this elswehere - we call it Five Card Throw.  We also play another variant which we call Crazy Five Card Throw, in this variant we have 3 card left on the river, but can use a maximium of 2 of them.  It is great fun, with lot of action, especially preflop, where all players more or less have playable hands."
(Simple?) 3-bet Scenario,"I'm surprised I haven't seen this (or maybe I have and just don't recall it).  I think my order is as follows: I'm damn confident that A2s is the hand I want the most here. It gives us card removal so he'll have AK, AQ, and AA considerably less often than in the other scenarios. Also, we won't get into too many marginal spots with TP postflop because we know our kicker sucks and it's much easier to differentiate between when he has AJ and JJ than if we were to instead have AJ and try to discern between AT and AQ (clearly this depends a ton on whether or not he'll call OOP, some players will never call in villains spot while others will call but also sometimes call with QQ+ for balance).  I think flatting the 75s is more profitable in a vacuum but 3betting it is fine. We'll have lots of barrel spots postflop with pair+draw type hands and it'll be hard for him to believe us when we're repping hands like 75s, so when we get there we should get lots of action. The problem with KJ is that, while we have card removal vs Kx/KK, he'll call us with pretty much every hand that dominates us and fold every hand that we dominate (barring some wacky history). So he'll be super tempted to fold/4bet bluff with KT, but he'll probably be ok with calling if he has KQ/AJ. 3betting 88 just sucks here because flatting it is way more +EV, unless the blinds are absolute squeeze monkeys (ignoring when we want to flat 88 with the intention of backraise/stacking off vs a squeeze because those table conditions are ultra rare). When we 3bet 88 we're seeing flops with overcards a ton of the time and we don't have equity to barrel off because we'll rarely have draws and when we're unimproved and behind, we're crushed. A deeper (and better) analysis would go into how this would change against specific villains but as a standard vs somewhat unknown regs at 5knl I think this is a good start."
NL600: River Decision IP vs TAG 3 Barrel,"Seen preflop action I kinda like the flop call because you have a little something + redraws and you can float the turn if he doesn't 2nd barrel. However once you hit your flush draw on the turn I'm not sure I like that call: you're getting only 2.2:1 on your $96 call and I think it's unlikely you'll extract much in case you hit (not to mention the reverse implied odds if he hits a bigger flush).  But YMMV and that wasn't your question anyway... You said he PFRs 23% from that position, so if he's able to 3-barrel bluff then he must have something like: KJ KT K9s K8s JT JT J9s T9s (maybe K7s, J8s, T8s, T7s).  These are basically if I'm not mistaken the only hands from a 23% range (if you include all pocket pairs in his 23% range) that you can beat. Any other hand is beating you: Any Axs, any pocket pair (22, 33 and 44 which now makes him a straight), any KQ, QJ, QT, Q9s (maybe Q8s). That's really not many hands of his range that didn't hit a little something: I think there's only about 25% of his 23% range that you are beating. Moreover he shall definitely not always 3-barrel bluff. So to me you're not winning this anywhere near often enough to win money on that river call.  Even if the above computation are very approximate and if about 100 occurences from MP (out of about 600 deals, you'll have about 100 deals where he's in MP) is not enough to get his true PFR from MP, I think you're way too far behind. To me river is a fold."
Best books for beginners Pot-Limit Omaha,"Best book, I don't know as it's pretty personal opinions, but Master Pot-Limit Omaha the modern aggressive approach by Herbery Okolowitz & Wladimir Taschner is good. Ok strictly speaking not the most beginner friendly but if you want an excellent book, in my opinion, and are willing to seriously digest the information I'd recommend. You will need to focus and really try your best to take the information in as it can be heavy if you're new to PLO, but you will end up a solid, good PLO player if you do. It's a bit old now, 2014, but unless you're playing with the PLO masters it's still very relevant and very good advice for most games still. Overall it's a book I recommend to someone who wants to seriously learn PLO."
Chances of winning tournament vs Entries?,"I have a decent ROI in on-line MTTs (70%+ at low-mid stakes)  The larger the field the harder it is to cash (ITM) and harder it is to outright win the MTT but it is easier to get a high ROI If you examine the results on OPR/Sharkscope for top-ranked players in different formats, you will see what is achievable For a top mid-stakes player in turbo or faster format it's roughly: 6 players:- ITM 35% and ROI 5% (+3-4%)
18 players:- ITM 25% and ROI 15% (+5-6%)
50-100 players:- ITM 20% and ROI 30% (+10-12%)

To win these you need a lot of luck no matter how amazing you play. If you use GTO, it's fairly easy to guarantee a profit over a large sample.  If you are a good player, your edge is greatest when the field is large and the blinds are slow.

Can I create freemium chip-based poker software without licence?,"Sure you can create such software, that is only a technical problem. Search over at stack overflow and you will find questions and answers related to poker shuffling routines and such. I am assuming you have some technical experience to take on such a challenge. With the question about licensing, I really can not tell you. It is a very complicated question that requires a professional answer. Anytime you mix poker with money your going to face some kind of legal challenge just about anywhere. If you are going to set up a online presence with a poker game were chips for the game can be purchased that is playing for money. So if your plan is to do something like that, consult a lawyer. "
Hands selection in a 6 table,"Here is a good article on a basic range of hands used in the TAG style: http://www.pokervip.com/school/poker-strategy/texas-hold-em-no-limit-beginner/tag-approach/ Basically your range is never fixed, you base your ranges on the style of play you are comfortable with and keep it flexible. One of the best things to do as a poker player is to change gears so whereas you may be a very tight aggressive (TAG) player in general if you find yourself on a table of players who always fold to aggression you should start becoming more of a loose aggressive player (LAG) by throwing more hands into your range. The opposite is also true, if you find yourself on a table full of aggressive loose players, you should tighten your range and become more strong side weighted."
What is the value in using free poker sites to learn poker?,"For cash games, when you feel you are by far the best player at the table, you can start playing for real money. Repeat this step on real money tables as well. What I think is interesting are the freeroll tournaments. I really learned a lot by doing this. You will learn playing in position, playing with your stacksize, adapting to new blind levels and so on. When you win some real money, you can play cash games for real money as well."
"1/2 NL: Call this villain's all-in with top pair, ace kicker?","Should our hero call the all-in? No. There are many arguments to this answer: Would you push on the flop, instead of raising $50? Is there a larger amount the hero could have raised, without being pot committed, that might have induced a fold? I wouldn't have pushed on the flop because there are many probable hands that beat you and would have played like this on the flop. Air would fold, draws would fold, but I doubt KJ or sets would have folded. You want weaker hands to call, not to fold. Regarding the second question, the answer is I don't know. If he's a megafish, then only giving him a beating, taking his cards and pushing him to the dealer would make him fold. If he's a TAG, perhaps a larger amount would do it. I cannot answer the second question because, as far as I read, he's an unknown. Would you re-raise pre-flop? Definitely. He is in HJ so his opening range is wide, so AK would do very well against his range. Plus, by calling you invited subsequent calls and/or squeezes from the blinds. In this hand it didn't happen, but this doesn't mean that it will never happen.  Another bonus to re-raising is that you make him define his hand. What would you have done if he had AA? A re-raise would probably induce a 4bet and you could have a decision in folding or shoving. By calling, you didn't have a clue that he has AA because you didn't give him a chance to give you that clue. My opinion is that the seeds of future trouble began by flatting the HJ's opening. Even so, do some hand reading on the flop. The flop is somewhat drawy, with many possible two pairs and the turn completed a straight draw. Plus, judge his actions: he isn't scared of your flop raise... he is so not scared that he dares to push turn... Sure, he played badly and got lucky, but your game wasn't flawless either. I would have reraised preflop, cbet flop and evaluate turn. In this light, a push is a very good indicator that you're beaten. I hope it helped,
Good luck! PS: if he had a bluff, then good for him, but even better for you. By folding the turn, his bluff succeeded, but he won a small amount of money."

"What does ""volatility on hand"" mean and how do players use it?","In this instance, it looks like the author is using the term ""volatility"" as a way of describing ""variance"" (or as a replacement for the word). A short definition is included in your quote, but another way I would put it is ""the amount in which the outcome in a particular hand could vary"". The calculation comes from statistics, I'll link the wikipedia page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance) but there are lots of other articles on google that you can check out for calculations relating specifically to poker. To me, it is a bit more important to understand the logic behind variance rather than outright calculate it (especially at the table) so I'll give a few examples. High Variance Hand:
you are on the button with 7s8s and MP raises 3x the BB. You 3-bet 3.5x the MP raise and MP calls. Flop comes 5h6cAd and MP checks to you. You C-bet half the pot and MP calls. Low Variance Hand:
Same situation as above, you are on the button with 7s8s and MP raises 3x the BB you call and the blinds call behind you. Flop comes the same, 5h6cAd and MP checks to you and you check, action is on the blinds. Without going through all of the action in these hands, there are some big differences between the high variance and the low variance hands that directly relate to the way that you played the hand. A hand that involves less players is ideal for weaker players simply because there is less to keep track of, reducing the possibility for errors in decision making. Strong players can be confident that they will make the correct decision or possibly outplay their opponents depending on the action. Strong players can take advantage of heads up play as well, but it is especially important for weaker players to focus on heads up pots. Bigger pots are one of the key points on variance, more money in the pot means that you will be increasing the amount that you win or lose once the hand is complete. It is a powerful tool for weaker players because playing this way forces the tough decisions on the other players. This does not mean to 3-bet every suited connector or to spew off chips no matter what they have, but it does mean that weaker players should lean towards betting and increasing the size of the pot when they have a significant amount of equity. This leaves the outcome more in the hands of the other player(s) in the hand, and depending on the player they have a decent chance of making a big mistake and awarding a large pot without the weaker player getting an opportunity to make mistakes. Strong players want to reduce variance because they will rarely make mistakes. Stronger players would rather play lots of smaller pots that they have a 60% chance of winning, rather than put their whole stack on the line with 60% equity in one big pot. This will prevent them from getting stacked when they end up losing a hand that they had the advantage in."
$2100 High Roller Event #1 hand review,"Preflop: I don't understand the 3x open from 88maca88. I guess he is saying that he is not folding to calculer_, but with AK he should be inducing the shove. Plus Fedor Holz (CrownUpGuy) can put him in some difficult spots when he 3x opens. He definitely does not want to play a huge pot with AK against the chipleader here. Maybe it was a misclick. calculer_ definitely has to fold with JTo. I ran the calculations and he should only shove around 88+,AJs+,AQo+. I think NastyMinder has an easy defend. Folding is way too tight and 3-betting would be very bad, considering the stacksizes around the table. Flop: NastyMinder flops a flush draw, a straight draw and an overcard.  I think 88maca88 bets too small. What hands is NastyMinder really going to fold here? Maybe JT, QT, QJ will find a fold, but even these hands I think can find a call on the flop. 88maca88 should definitely fire at least 200k to take it down sometimes or get some real value. NastyMinder has an easy call. He has great equity, but he doesn't want to play a massive pot, because of ICM. However, you want raise here sometimes for value, so I think it is important to work in some bluffs too. But Tc7c has simply too much equity to bluff. I'd prefer a hand like 7h4h, since they can fold to a 4-bet. Turn: 88maca88 bets huge to size up the potential river shove. I again do not like this play. This board is very favorable for the big blind, so you need to be very selective with your bluffs. AK here is just two overcards and nothing else. There are so many better hands to bluff with here. AK even has showdown value too. Just check it back. NastyMinder now has an interesting decision. Should he call or shove? In my opinion he just has to shove here. Think about all the good hands NastyMinder wants to shove: 64s, 43s, 86s, 75s, 88, 66, 33, 44 that is a total of 22 combinations. You can slowplay some of these hands, but generally this will not be a good play. How often is 88maca88 going to bluff this board on the river? How often is he going to value bet this board with on overpair. Not that often. You don't want to see a club roll off. With the majority of your good hands you want to be shoving. Now obviously you need to pick some bluffs as well. You need to pick the hands that have the most equity when called, but have the least amount of showdown value. Other than 9c7c I can't think of a better hand than NastyMinder is holding. I think he just has to shove here to play a balanced strategy and I really don't understand why he did not.  River: Pretty standard at this point. NastyMinder has to check and like I pointed out 88maca88 just checks it back and takes it down."
Tournament versus cash game,"Will not accept my own answer. In a cash game a chip has a direct cash equivalent.  If you double up you double up.  If you go broke you can just re-buy.  EV (expected value) is correct. In a tournament the chip does not have a direct cash equivalent. In a tournament the objective is to survive.  A chip you lose is worth more than a chip you win.  Double up early does not double your chances to win.  Lose your stack guarantees your chance to be out of the tournament. A coin flip is not a good bet in a tournament.  Unless you are up against a small stack. You have more fold equity as a chip they lose worth more than a chip they win.   Especially against smaller stack.  Avoid all-in unless you are pretty sure you have your opponent dominated.  Add in speculative hands like suited connectors as when they hit you will typically have your opponent dominated. Go for pot control. Some opponents are not going to let you play for pot control. But you cannot auto fold or they will abuse you. Even if you are 2:1 not really looking to get all your chips in. If they put you all in then you should call if you think you are 2:1.  Avoid bigger stacks unless you are on premium cards. Range will play different unless you are small stacked. A hand like 78s is more valuable as if you hit a flush, straight, or trips then you are likely good. A one gapper is valuable as more disguised. So you play more hands if you can get in for the right price.  A weak ace goes down in value as you can lose a big pot. Don't let your bet sizing telegraph your hand.  Come in for like 2.5 BB.  Raise with 78s is where it gets expensive but that is also a spot were you can make some relatively safe money.  If you are just going to call with 78s then you need to do that with some of your premium hands also. If a fish opens for even 5 BB call with your whole range and stack them because they think 2 pair is good.  Or call down middle pair when you have top pair.  You can still be aggressive if you have the chips but still play for pot control.  Negreanu will typically bet out the flop even with a 4 outer draw to apply pressure. Even when he hits he smooth calls a lot. Seems like he checks the turn a lot. As the blinds go up compared to your stack size you are going to need to play bigger pots and all-ins. If you are the big stack you can abuse the small stacks with like a weak ace late.  You can open from the button with almost any two cards. Start opening for little higher. But you don't need get crazy as your chips behind have fold equity. A draw hand like 78s is not worth playing against a small stack.  If they are real small and you know they would be playing a wide range then adjust but be aware you can be raised behind. If I get late in a tournament I totally flop it around and get aggressive pre as I am not going to be one of the better players at the table. They are not going to let me play pot control. Not the only way to play a tournament. Some go aggressive early to build chips."
Can a King be beaten in one card poker?,"The king still has a big edge. Chances of him being beat are 4/48. It is impossible for the challenger to play an unexploitable strategy that is profitable in the long term.  The challenger cannot profitably bluff all of his hands, since most of the time he is beat and the king can just call him down. The challenger cannot only bet his value, since the king can just always fold to his bets. A mixture of both strategies will not work, since the challenger, if he is bluffing balanced say with only fives and sixes, will still have way too many hands that are beat by the king. The king can just fold to the bets and still show profit. If the challenger starts bluffing more, the king can start to call everything down and also show profit. Bluffing all your hands doesn't work.
Bluffing no hands doesn't work.
Bluffing a mixture of good and bad hands doesn't work. Bet sizing will not matter either. Betting exclusivly small with bluffs and value will get the same results as mentioned above. Betting exclusivly big will as well. Betting small with bluffs and big with value is exploitable and the king can only call the challenger's small bets and vice versa. Anything between ""small"" and ""big"" will result in the same outcome. What card would make this game fair? For this to be the case the challenger has to 1. have the same number of value bets and bluffs in his betting range and 2. he should bet 50% of the time. This way the king will be breaking even whether he calls or folds. Given that the blinds are infinitesimally small compared to the bets the game will be break even if these conditions are met. There are a total of 48 combinations possible for the challenger. The challenger thus must bet 24 combinations, of which 12 combinations need to be value. If the 'fair card' is a Jack, the challenger can exactly have 12 combinations of value (Aces, Kings and Queens). The challenger should look to bluff with 12 combinations and his range is complete."

Fundamental Theorem of Poker vs Morton's Theorem,"Never heard of Morton's Theorem, so i did some research. There are 2 big differences; Sklansky's Theorem of Poker is applied mostly in HU pots, while Morton's Theorem is applied exclusively on multi-way pots. Morton's Theory says basically that it may be correct (ie. EV+) if your opponents would instead fold a draw (ie. correctly, based on pot odds) rather calling incorrectly with a draw, based on the size of the pot (calculation on the above link), thus moving the equity of the folding player to you instead. Personally, i never like to make my opponents folding a draw; you want to make money out of their draws, not trying to isolate players, holding hands you don't know about. There's also more calculations for Morton's Theorem."

Conversion of hand history from unsupported site,"I was on Bovada (not anymore, its totally rigged),  and using an online hand converter to convert my hands to pokerstars, which seems to be the standard people are using for conversion.   However,  some of the hands didn't parse properly and errored in HM2, (about 30% of them).   I didn't have time to spend figuring out why, I'd rather just code my own converter.   So I have been working on writing that as a web application in PHP/jQuery using mySQL database on a basic $10/mo host.   I'm thinking I might give access to the public for a small fee, like 1cent for 10 hands or something like that.   I started using pokerstars as the format I'm converting to and it's really not too tough, although I think it may have been the wrong way to go.   I am probably going to scrap that and start using something else. So to answer your question,  first off, I've tried the pokerstars format and you are correct, it's kind of a pain and probably not the best option.   Second,  you should probably do what I'm doing right now.    Going to all the different sites and networks supported by HM2 and setting up accounts, playing freerolls or micros (some of them give you a free $5 or $10 to mess with when you start), and getting the hand history files and just looking at the way they are formatted and trying to decide which one will be easiest to convert from Bovada and other sites that are currently not supported. If you want, we could compare notes on this (probably just by posting them here then everyone interested in this subject could also benefit).    I have been busy with work the last couple weeks so have not had a lot of time, but let me know your thoughts,  how far any research has gotten you, and maybe we can pool our resources to come to a solution faster.   I dunno.  :) I'll post more here later when I have some data compiled on the different sites.  Do you mind posting which site it is that you are working with trying to convert.    It doesn't look like one I've seen yet."
pineapple open face chinese shooting the moon,"Since it is very hard to shoot the moon in POFC, other players do not scoop you if you get there. So you gain 20 points from each player.  Otherwise the risk you take would (by far) not be worth the outcome. (Imo, I think that 20 points from each player is still not enough to make this play profitable.)"
Facing an all in,"It really depends on the card room and the rules they play, there is no definitive ""Everyone must play like this"" rule. You can find some ""official"" rules out there but these are generally rules enforced by different poker institutions and are not universal. Some rooms enforce that you must declare your intent before throwing chips into the pot with penalties. Such penalties may be turning the chips to dead money and folding your hand or forcing you to call in this situation. Here in general Player C would have been forced to call and received change out of the pot from the dealer. Other rooms will force player C to raise here even if he was just going to call because he has put more in the pot than the previous bet or raise. In general the most common rule is that you must declare your intent. Here is an example of the TDA rule set for calling: 39: Methods of Calling Standard and acceptable forms of calling include: A) verbally declaring “call”; B) pushing out chips equal to a call; C) silently pushing out an overchip; or D) silently pushing out multiple chips equal to a call under the multiple-chip betting rule (Rule 43). Silently betting chip(s) relatively tiny to the bet (ex: NLHE, blinds 2k-4k. A bets 50k, B then silently puts out a single 1k chip) is non-standard, strongly discouraged, subject to penalty, and will be interpreted at TDs discretion, including being ruled a full call. 42:   Oversized Chip Betting Anytime when facing a bet or blind, placing a single oversized chip in the pot is a call if a raise isn’t first verbally declared. To raise with an oversized chip, raise must be declared before the chip hits the table surface. If raise is declared (but no amount), the raise is the maximum allowable for that chip. When not facing a bet, placing an oversized chip in the pot without declaration is a bet of the maximum for the chip. Now again depending on the card room your playing at some force your raise to be double the last raise, so in this case Player C would have to raise a minimum of $152. Others do not and as long as your raise exceeds the previous bet by at least 1 blind the bet is valid. Others rooms will force Player C to exceed the current pot size or at least a percentage of the current pot. So in this case he would have to raise $126 or more. If you are ever in doubt, always speak to the dealer or the floor-man about the house rules before taking an action your unsure of."
Calculating the Probability of Reaching a Certain Amount of BB vs Hero,"This is a fairly straightforward statistics question. You should look into the z-score for further details.  If we assume your results against this opponent follows a normal distribution, the Excel formula to answer your question would be: That's the probability your opponent will be ahead at least X BB's after A hands, asssuming Y and Z are in units of BB/100."
Should you use average value or marginal value when deciding which hands to play?,"I'm assuming you are playing against 7 players who never fold and always raise if possible, on all the streets. Then any hand with an equity > 1/8 = 12.5% is worth playing. The blinds have practically no influence, since they are tiny compared to the huge pots. I've played a bit with PokerStove: The best hands are AA (38.8%), KK (32.9%), QQ (28.3%), AKs (24.9%), JJ (24.6%), AQs (23.3%), KQs (22.6%), AJs (22.1%), TT (21.7%), AKo (21.6%), KJs (21.4%), ATs (21.0%), QJs (20.8%), KTs (20.4%).
So all these hands are clearly worth playing. Also, it's interesting to see the high value of suitedness in these multiway pots. The results are surprising me a bit. I didn't expect the >12.5% range to be that big. It goes down to 22 (13.2%), Q2s (13.2%), 53s (12.6%), T9o (14.1%), for example. However, since the range consists of suited hands mostly, it looks a bit larger than it really is (the ratio ""suited hands to offsuit hands"" is 1:3, generally)."
Short stack strategy,Your advantage when shortstacking versus multiple opponents with bigger stacks comes from a couple of basic factors: It is easier for beginners. The calculations are a lot simpler because you only have to look at your opponents preflop behaviour and playing style. You don't end up with hands that have some value but are not really good in a big pot on the turn versus a bet/raise and no idea what your opponent is doing here. Opponents with bigger stacks will try to outplay each other by entering hands preflop with speculative holdings from time to time. You can exploit this by playing only very strong hands preflop and forcing them to fold and leave the rest of the money they already invested on the table or to call with a worse hand than you have. Opponents will bluff and semibluff (weak hand + draw played aggressively) each other from time to time in bigger pots. When you shortstack you are all in preflop or on the flop and you can thus not be taken off of your hand and you will win the main or the side pot a lot of time when one bigger stack (semi-)bluffs his opponent out of a hand when you are already all in. It all depends on how your opponents adjust to you though and if you sit with many shortstacks and only a few big stacks then the last 2 factors won't really come into play as much. I hope this was useful. GL
Does the order of posting the missed blinds in texas holdem matter?,"To answer the question: Are all blinds posted clockwise starting from the dealer button regardless of the blind type (missed or not)? Action would be clockwise regardless, each player who posted will have an option. I have seen this happen recently at Crown Casino (Melbourne, Australia) where four players returned at the same time. Dead blinds will have wait for the button to pass...  Very interesting discussion RE: players opting to post dead blinds based on other players in the hand. Either way all players make their decision before they are dealt in - I have found no evidence of a pre-hand order rule, you are either dealt in or not."
Which hand wins: 23 vs. 9J on a AAKKQ board? [duplicate],"In Poker you use the best 5 cards, so in this case no one wins...it's split. In fact, the only cards that could win here are an A, K, TJ, or pocket Q's. Knowing this, even if he had JJ or even QJ, it would still be split."
A2345 Straights permitted,"There's not really an ""official rules of poker"" out there. Asking for a citation for this is like asking for a citation to the rule that states a flush beats a straight. However, the WSOP.com site does have a page on hand ranking : http://www.wsop.com/how-to-play-poker/hand-ranking.asp And in it, the WSOP official site states ""In Poker, the Ace is the highest card and the 2 card (Deuce) is the lowest. However, the Ace can also be used as a low card, with the value of 1."" The only games that aren't going to count aces in wheel straights or allow aces to be used as a low card are generally going to be lowball games (2-7 Triple Draw, Badeucey, Badacey, Razz, etc). Lowball games can sometimes have crazy rules, even in official card room settings (like not allowing check-raises, or not allowing you to check a made 8)."
Ruling on a non-standard check,"The only relevant question here is what the other players thought and how they reacted. If they thought it was a check, and reacted in any way that you might have been able to see before you bet, then ruling it a check is reasonable to prevent an angle shot. But if the bet was reasonably simultaneous with your ambiguous declaration, and the other players saw it as a bet, it's a bet. Of course the size of the bet cannot be a consideration. A professional dealer in this situation, if he assumed that your ""yeah"" was a check (which is a reasonable assumption on its own), would then rap the table to indicate the end of betting before dealing the next card--which would give you an opportunity to object and ask him to wait for your bet, which he would do. If one of the other players then objected, he would call a floor, but he would never rule on his own."
What are good web sites to learn No Limit Texas Hold'em?,"Before I start, let me say that if you are from outside the US I would definitely take advantage of sites that offer rake-based-membership. In the US, we have DragTheBar, which offers free membership based on the rake taken from your hands at Carbon Poker.  I would even go a step further and say try every single site that offers a free trial. Stagger them (start a new trial as the other ends) and you'll be set for months. Just make sure to cancel before the trial expires. Note: Because I'm a beginner, I will only offer recommendations for the beginner levels. My current game is Cash, 4-tabling 6Max 5NL. If you play Tournaments (MTT, SnG) then you'll want sites geared for those as well. Generally, you should be playing the micros (2NL-50NL). Because of this, you'll want to focus on sites who also focus on the micros. And while there are plenty of sites that focus on beginners, you really want to focus on micros. If for any other reason, check Drag the Bar because BlackRain79 is a coach there. He was (is?) the #1 micro stakes player in the world in terms of ridiculous volume and profit. The coaches there are great and in my narrow experience, seem to be far more prepared than on other sites. As a beginner you'll be slammed with too much information anyways, so it's important that the information is as easily accessible as possible (and easy to ask). TwoPlusTwo is in the top 3 thousand sites visited in the US. That's huge, but in my opinion it's too huge. Unless I land on 2p2 through Google, it's just too intimidating for the beginner [me]. CardsChat is simple - all the top level forums can almost fit on a single screen! I'm only just now breaking out of my social-shell, but once I get a certain number of posts I'll also be eligible for their Freeroll tournaments...and you can too. Their strategy articles are also well organized and will get you competently playing in an afternoon. This doesn't answer your question (beginner to advance), but it was too long to leave as a comment so there you go :)"
Who wins if two players have a straight? [duplicate],"I think this question is a little different than the usual question that needs the standard Best Five Cards answer. In this question, the nuance is whether player 2 gets any special consideration for having his 10 counterfeited. Does player 2 get some sort of bonus for being able to play both of his cards to make the best five-card hand, while player 1 could use only one of his cards to make the same hand? Nope. Both players have the same hand, regardless of how they got there."
Can I showdown early,"I am going to ignore the bet amounts and your stack size first and give you a general answer, you have no fold equity anyway. Well in live, yes you can, there is nothing stopping you from physically turning your hand over and if you're all-in your hand cannot be made dead. However it is extremely bad etiquette. I have been a poker dealer for 3 years, dealing around the world, I can guarantee you you will get a penalty. Even if a player doesn't call floor on you the dealer should, I know I would. You are effecting the game unfairly and really the dealer's job is to enforce a fair game and a smooth running game. Maybe in a local casino or home game where the rules might be a bit more relaxed, you know the staff, everyone is friendly, you can get away with it, any event or really most places you will get a penalty. So what you gain in folds will cost you at least a round penalty. Plus why bother turning your hand face-up? If they have anything beating you they'll call, if they're flipping they'll call. Hell with your stack size the guy who made it 70 will call with any two likely, you'll be beating nearly his entire range anyway.. You're only going to get folds from hands you're crushing which you want to call you. You're just giving information away for free. Also I would never assume that people you're playing against will, as you put it 'Obviously', do what you want. Everyone plays differently, someone may just decide they don't appreciate you angle shooting and just call you with any two and hope to get lucky."
What is the best poker tracker/software?,"HoldemManager 2 and PokerTracker 4 are still the market leaders.  HoldemManager 2 uses a lot of ram, especially when you play 12+tabled and use a HUD.
But when you play on MacOSx you can only use PokerTracker 4 - because Holdem Manager 2 is Windows only. But it also depends on which stakes you play. If you only play micros and do not want to spend 100$ for tracking software, you could also use FreePokerDB"
Pot Odds Paradox in Short Stack,"Your ""paradox"" arises from the fact that aside from your bet, the pot contains enough expected value already for each player that neither could improve their expected ending stack by folding.  With too small of a stack, you can't bet enough so that the opponent loses money.  However, with your bet you can still reduce the expected overall gain from his point of view. To illustrate, say the pot is 100 chips, you have 20 chips and your opponent has 100 chips remaining after the turn.  You know he has a 20% chance of beating you on the river. By checking, your EV from the pot is 80 chips;  for your opponent it's 20.  Your expected ending stack is 100 and his is 120.  Everybody's happy, right? Now what if you bet your 20 chips and he calls?  Your EV from the new pot of 140 is 112, which will be your ending stack--an improvement!  His expected ending stack will be (.20 * 140) + (80) = 108.  It was beneficial to you and detrimental to him to have that bet compared to a check.  However, his stack of 108 is still better than the 100 chips he's sitting with, so it's +EV for him to call--but not AS positive as it would have been to not face a bet.  As a short stack, you can't force him to make a negative overall EV decision, but you can reduce the magnitude of his positive EV.  The pot is big enough to essentially give him some ""free"" added value. Ok, now let's say you had 40 chips instead, you bet it and he calls.  Your expected ending stack is .8 * 180 = 144 compared to 40 that you started with --an improvement of 104 chips...hmmm, that's more than was in the pot to begin with.  His expected ending stack is now (.20 * 180) + 60 = 96.  Now he's losing money by calling.  And that money is going directly to you, hence the improvement of 104 chips which was more than the pot. To sum it up, your paradox comes from comparing an apple to an orange.  The EV of the bet and call in and of itself (not considering the whole pot) can't be compared to the overall EV of the hand that does consider the whole pot.  As a short stack, you can improve your EV and you can decrease the EV of your opponent compared to to EV of not betting (or betting less)--but you can't put him to an overall negative EV decision.  With more chips, you can get over that break-even point (from his perspective) to end up benefitting yourself even more."
Why is this a poor play?,"I think the writer is arguing that calling with A5 is a bad idea preflop, while your italicized thoughts from the callers position are talking about post flop. Post flop, I think A5 on an A65 rainbow board is a strong hand; however preflop A5 is fairly weak. The ""Great"" sentence from the excerpt is the writer putting the caller (who holds A5) on single paired Ace with a kicker less than a K (like A7, A8, ... AQ), which are each far more likely than A6 or A5."
Need analysis of flop bluff shove,"*Range charts made with https://premiumpokertools.com/equity-calculator Here's my analysis! Assuming your opponent is min-raising about 80ish percent of hands preflop, a reasonable calling range against your small 3-bet size might be this:  After the flop, removal effects make villain's range look like this:  When you shove 3.5 times the flop, the villain's minimum defense frequency is 22%. If the villain only calls 2-pairs (18 combos), straights (20 combos), and flushes (15 combos) they're already at that 22%. Generally bet sizing is about finding a size that puts your opponents range into the most awkward spot, and this 3.5 x pot size doesn't do it here since they can call pretty comfortably with the above 53 combos. Villain might also reasonably call with AsJx with good equity and the nut-flush blocker too. If they call wider than I estimated preflop and need to defend wider, then KxTs, QxTs, JxTs could make reasonable bluff catchers too. For these reasons, I disagree with your statement ""My reasoning is : If I were my opponent, I would not have called unless I had Ace of spades (and probably another spades)"". If you play this way, you will almost certainly be over-folding in these spots. Villain could (and probably would) call wider than this. Even if you have a read that the villain plays too tight, a smaller bet size (50% - 75% pot) would probably get an overly tight opponent to over-fold here. Another caution (though not necessarily a mistake!) I would make here, is with the particular hand that you chose to bluff with. When you shove 3.5 x the pot, we know that your opponent doesn't have to call you with anything worse than 2-pair. That means your value hands are most likely going to be sets, straights, and flushes (9 combos of sets (KK, QQ, JJ), 16 combos of straights (AT), and, say, about 25 combos of flushes (suited aces, low suited connectors and gappers). That's about 50 hands for value. Your value bet to bluff ratio should be 9:7 (close to 50:50) given your overbet size. I'm not entirely sure what your range might look like here, but before bluffing aces I might look to bluff hands with a spade and a good blocker (As, Ts, maybe 9s) since you make it less likely that your opponent has a flush or the AT/T9 straight, and in case you do get called by a lower flush or a straight, you have a redraw to beat them. If you agree with me here and do bluff with these spades, you'll just have to be careful not to bluff every ace you have too, since you'd probably be over-bluffing."
"Risky home game hand, right or wrong move?","Before you bluff an amateur be sure they are willing to make a big lay down. Sounds like you put 435 at risk to win 130. You put him on a 2 pair or a big pair. If you really had QQ, TT, or QT would you over-bet the turn like that? No you would bet like 1/2 the pot and get more value on the river. Yes it looks bluffy. You have no outs.  Pair your 7 or 3 is not going to be the best hand.  Check-fold the turn and bluff the river with a pot sized bet if the opponent checks back. You put your tournament stack at risk to an opponent that has shown no weakness.  Not a good long term play."
Player allowed to play for main pot after folding during side pot action?,"No, B folded. They are no longer in the hand. Cards are tabled, main pot of 75$ goes to A or C, depending on who has the best cards. If a side pot exists it goes to C."
"If you put chips out but don't say anything while it's your turn, can you take them back, even if you didn't say anything?","Some casinos have a betting line on the table or other house rules that may differ from the norm. But generally, a player in turn is bound by his first action, whether verbal or by movement of chips. A player may count or assemble chips immediately in front of his stack, but if he makes a forward betting motion with chips in hand, that is a binding bet. In most casinos, the amount of the bet is not binding until he removes his hand, so a player may come out with a stack and cut off a bet, but the initial motion commits the player to at least a minimum bet or call. If the player is out of turn, the bet is binding if there is no change in the action intervening. If there's a raise before the player's turn, he off the hook and may take any action. Some casinos don't enforce this rule. ""First action is binding"" also applies to betting more as well as less. If a player in turn says ""I call"", or puts a calling amount into the pot (including a single over-size chip), he has called, and his turn is over. He may not then say ""...and I raise..."". This is called a string raise, and is illegal everywhere except every TV show and movie you've ever seen."
How precise is math in the heat of battle?,"If such a player is approximating a game-theoretic-optimal (GTO) strategy, then they are essentially putting their opponent in a situation where it doesn't matter what they do. In other words, whatever information you believe you could glean from their play will not help you alter their expectation (i.e., reduce their expectation while increasing yours). That being said, playing a GTO  strategy is very difficult, and much often players (including yourself, based on the nature of your question) will attempt to play an exploitative strategy. Employing an exploitative strategy makes oneself vulnerable to counter-exploitation. So, the answer to your question relies on how closely your opponent is attempting to approximate a balanced GTO strategy. If they are approximating a GTO strategy, they are giving up essentially nothing by taking any amount of extra time to perform necessary calculations. On the other hand, if they are playing a totally unbalanced and exploitative strategy, they could potentially be giving a lot of useful information to a [counter-]exploitative opponent by doing any number of things during the course of a hand (such as taking an unusual amount of time to make an action). It entirely depends on your opponent's strategy. "
How can a poker player alter their strategy to exploit java.util.Random,"Shuffling a deck on a computer is not a trivial task. It is not the same task as encryption and it is not the same task as game simulation, both of which use PRNG's.
http://www.datamation.com/entdev/article.php/616221/How-We-Learned-to-Cheat-at-Online-Poker-A-Study-in-Software-Security.htm Is a description of a flaw in the way the deck was shuffled at PlanetPoker.com, the very first web site to offer online poker for cash. A really short description of the flaw is that they produced the seed for the shuffle from the CPU clock. It was a total failure. It was predictable and could be hacked quickly and easily and it was also statistically flawed. There is only one million possible shuffles that could be had from the CPU clock, and there are 80,658,175,170,943,878,571,660,636,856,403,766,975,289,505,440,883,277,824,000,000,000,000 ways to shuffle a 52 card deck, which makes one million just a very tiny tiny fraction of all possible shuffles. Planet Poker had a shuffle routine that was neither secure, or random in the gaming sense. This exploit was the most well known. A lot of people thought good they plugged the hole lets move on. But there have been exploits since that involve getting at peoples hole cards. Patches have been made, but is it fixed, not likely. The challenges of securing a poker game online is daunting, much more complicated then most security problems. The PP exploit only needed a little data to break a hand, the hole card and the flop, was enough to use a little brute force to figure out what the rest of the players had in hand and what the turn and the river was going to be.
And that is one of the main challenges, you have to give up a little of the key in a poker hand, to every one involved. Anything can be decrypted with enough time and computer power. When you have to give up some of the solution(IE a poker hand and flop is part of the solution) you are giving a hacker a lot of information that does not need to be figured out with brute force. A shuffle in poker also has to be a statistically valid shuffle. This means that the shuffle has to play like a real poker game. If you go looking on the web for PRNG (Pseudo Random Number Generators), you will find a wide variety of them. Some are made for simulation, some are made for secure random numbers. You cannot guarantee a secure PRNG will produce statistically valid numbers for a poker game, nor can you guarantee a statistically valid PRNG will produce secure numbers that will keep the shuffle key unknown in a meaningful way. What you really need to consider is a pretty comprehensive survey of the state of the art with security at a online poker room. You need highly specialized advice if your going to be playing for money with your software. It is a cat and mouse game between hacks and poker sites that is still going on."
Miracle Full House Beats Me,"First, as people have stated on another recent question here, there may well be cheating by players in online poker. But what you're describing is not all that fishy. You don't describe the pre-flop action or how many players were in the hand. You also don't describe the suits of your hand, the flop and the villain's hand, which I'd argue has at least a little bearing here, since flush draws can be very attractive to people and having even a back-door flush draw can make a difference between a call and a fold being correct. You also don't describe the relative stack sizes at the table, which are important in determining the odds a player would be getting to call you. All those things would help in determining just how crazy (or not) the villain's call was. Next, you flopped a straight, which is a great hand on that board to be sure, but: So, you have the case where you're not nutted, and the board is attractive to all sorts of holdings. You go all-in and you get called. Here's what PokerStove says about your odds.  First, on a non-suited board: You have an 84% chance of winning the hand. That's pretty good, but your opponent has about a 1-in-6 chance of winning even so -- any K wins it for him, plus his back-door draws. Now, if the villain also has a flush draw (note the diamonds on the board and in the villain's hand): In this case, the villain is getting amazing odds. He's got a 45% chance to win. It's almost a coin flip, and given the money already in the pot, it's unlikely to be a mistake for him to call you even if he knows exactly what you have. So, you have a right to be disappointed in the result of the hand, but these things happen, and it wasn't even a big outlier. You might also question the wisdom of going all-in there given the number of other players in the pot and the fact that they were all likely to hit a piece of that board, but that's a question for another day. Is it rigged? Maybe, but probably not. Did the guy get lucky? Maybe, but not that lucky. The more you play, the more you will encounter hands like this and worse. All you can do is get back in there and try to make good decisions with your future hands."
Why do players join a tournament late?,"If you late register, all pots you play will be much more significant, compared to pots you play in the earlier stages of the game. Players can opt to late register, because playing the earlier stages is simply not worth their time. Their hourly rate is higher when they late register. Another reason is, some players like to gamble. They prefer short-stacked poker and don't really care if it is sub optimal. Or they just randomly registered for some tournaments, where some of them happen to be in their later stages."
Most profitable initial bet,"While many beginners are guilty of not betting enough pre-flop,
  another typical beginner mistake is betting too much. An example would
  be raising 5x-6x the size of the blinds when you are first to enter a
  hand in a game where the standard raise is 3x. Sure, everyone might
  fold and you pick up the blinds – and if that was your goal then it
  worked, but what if your intention was to maximize your winnings with
  a solid starting hand? Your failure was likely the result of improper
  bet sizing. This beginners article does basically brings up the important things to think about: What is the intention of your betting at the moment? Do you want to steal the Blinds? Runner Runner and you want action? What is your play? What is your image at the table? Are you a maniac? Are you a rock? Are you playing 50% of your hands preflop or 10%? What is the average betting size at the table? A 2.5x open bet could end up in the same result as a 5.5x open bet. But also you could lose action when you've wanted it... Adjusting Your Bets Different games play differently. I think it was correct to adjust your game at that day, but I would not use it as a new ""strategy""."
What tie breakers exist?,"When I hear tie breaker in poker, I think of the rule where the player
with the most chips at the start of a hand ranks higher in a
tournament when two or more players are eliminated in the same hand of
a tournament. When in comes to the hands themselves, there is no such thing as a tie
breaker. There are only two cases: 1) There is a tie -> split pot 2) There is no tie So your real question might be, how to tell which hand is better between two hands which are close in value. The simplest way to do this is to always think of the best five card hand each player can make. That's the only rule you need to know, and it implies things like one pair hands have three kickers, while two pair hands and quads have one kicker. The suit of the cards is irrelevant in all hands except flushes and straight flushes (including royal). Two flushes of different suits, but with the same card ranks, results in a tie, however that is very rare in all game variants and
impossible in Hold'em since the board requires three cards of one suit
for anyone to have a flush in that suit.  Obviously when comparing straights, we only need to compare the top card, since we know the rank of all five cards in the straight when we are told the rank of the top card, and I'm sure you're aware that we consider the top card in the straight (or straight flush) A2345 to be the 5, not the A.  I'll give some examples to make the five card comparison concept clearer:  For example, consider this situation where both players tie with junk: Player 1: 6♥ 2♣ Player 2: 4♦ 3♦ Board: A♠K♠ 9♥T♣7♥ You have to be careful how you interpret Radu's answer here. If you
were to walk through all the cards in order you might mistakenly think
that Player 1 would win, but that is wrong. You only walk through the
players' best 5 card hands. In this case, both players' best 5 card
hand is the board, so they tie.  Here is a similar situation, which results in a tie: Player 1: Q♠ J♠ Player 2: Q♦ 3♦ Board: A♠K♠ 7♦7♣9♥ If you use the best five card rule, it is easy to see that this is a
tie as well. Both players have a pair of 7's with AKQ kickers, that's
all five cards, so the J doesn't change anything. A one pair hand
always has three kickers, unless you're playing a variant where it is
possible to have less than 5 cards, in which case a missing card is
worse than a kicker of 2. IE (3♥3♣2♠ will beat
3♦3♠X).  The rank of the cards comes into play with all hands, the rank which
there are the most of is always compared first (rank the set before the pair in a full house, rank the pair before the three kickers in a one pair hand, and rank the quads before the kicker in a Four of a kind hand) and then the highest
rank cards are compared first for ties in quantity (for two pairs: the top pair is compared first, for kickers: the highest kicker counts first).  Since we always consider the rank of all cards, flushes get compared card by card, just like the high card rule, so in this case: Player 1: 6♣ 5♣ Player 2: A♦ 4♣ Player 3: K♣ 2♥ Board: A♣ J♣ T♣ 9♣ 7♣ Every player has an ace high flush, but Player 3 wins, because the second highest card in his flush is a K, which is better than the J in the other players' flushes. Now suppose that Player 3 was all in, so there is a side pot that only Players 1 and 2 are eligible for. They tie, since they both have the same flush, which is on the board. Their best five card hands don't use either of their hole cards. 
 It is much easier to think about comparing the best five card
hands, then to try to memorize when to apply kickers and when not to. 
 Now I'll address the examples from your question:  Suits don't matter, two pairs leaves room for one kicker in the best five card hand, so in the following situation we have a tie: Player 1: A♥ 9♣ Player 2: A♠ T♦ Board: A♣ Q♥ Q♠ K♠ 9♦ Both players have AAQQK, however if that K on the board was an 8 or lower, then Player 2 would win, since he would have AAQQT, against AAQQ9. The pair of 9's is meaningless since it doesn't fit into the best five card hand. This is a tie, for two straights to have the same final number, all five cards must have the same rank. This is also a tie, for the same reason as the straights. You win in both these cases, since the K beats the J, and the 9 beats the 8, but this rule only applies for your best five cards, even if you have more cards of that suit (see above)."
Are there any good strategies for dealing with relentless bettors?,"The best way to beat this kind of player is tight-aggressive. you're not going to outplay this one, you're not going to bluff them, and you're certainly not going to be able to control them. All you can do is beat them. But it requires very disciplined uncreative play.  You let them self destruct right into your stack. This kind of player is going to raise with a wide variety of hands, he is almost always going to do a continuation bet on the flop, and more often then he should be he is going to continue the continuation all the way to the river. They will give you ample opportunities to take chips.  There is a great tool widely available online. It is a trainer to train you to beat loose, aggressive irrational players. Master it and you will be able to beat aggressive, relentless bettors. To find it go to any online poker site and look for the free play item on the menu. I know it sounds a little absurd, but a side of the game that good players often overlook is what discipline you need to over come the donkies. It is a good thing to understand on a deep level. It is not hard to beat foolishly aggressive players, but there is some subtlety to optimizing this. It is kind of like playing aces, every idiot wins in the long run with aces, better players win much more, the difference between the good player and the bad player is that good players understand how to win more with aces and the bad know they can mindlessly play aces and that is good enough. I sincerely suggest a few hundred hours of play money, and an occasional refresher.  There is one more thing you should be keeping in the back of your mind when you came across a player that is aggressive, relentless. This is the mode that great players play in. Good players are generally tight and aggressive, but as they gain experience the range of hands they can play profitably widens. I don't play K-8 because I don't know enough to play it really well. When I see players that play K-8 I tend to class them as fools, but Daniel Negranu plays K-8, and a wide variety of hands I don't, because he can profitably. There are a lot of great players out there that are not famous and able to play in this mode very effectively. Be wary, if the player keeps breaking your heart every time you have a big hand, you might of ran into someone you will not get an upside with. "
Coin flips on cash game,"It all depends on pot odds. If you have better than 50% pot odds and have 50% equity versus your opponent's range, and you have the bankroll to handle the variance, then you should be looking to play for stacks. This will always produce a long term winning strategy, because you're getting >50% return on a 50% bet. Do you see why? The only situation where you should be looking for ""better spots"" is if you are underrolled for the game you are playing.* In which case the optimal strategy is to move down in stakes so that you can play optimally. Playing suboptimally at higher stakes because you can't afford to gamble when the odds are good will almost certainly produce a lower winrate than playing optimally at lower stakes. *Except in tournaments where your tournament life has a $ value and ICM can be a serious consideration. Better spots do not exist in cash games. Assuming an adequate bankroll, spots are either +EV, -EV or Neutral EV. That's it."
Final Table of Tournament - Hand History Example,I think I would have shoved preflop. You only had 13bbs. So AKs shove in this position is good in my opinion. I dont think he would have been calling you once you shoved over the top either. So in my opinion yes you played it wrong.
What if you get a straight flush on flop?,"I think the odds that someone will have a higher straight flush is very very very low.
If you got such a hand you should assume you will win it.   How to play?  well, it depends on your position and the other players play (loose, tight, aggressive, etc.) I think the following will be a good guidelines: Anyway, you shouldn't fold in any case. see this video. pay attention to the odds at 1:24 wsop 2008 amazing hand  Regards,

Interactive texas holdem learning,The best interactivity is playing with other real opponents. Just open a poker client and keep playing. If you are to scared to play for real money play for play money. After you finish your session do a hand review. Pick a couple of hands which you remember as tough or pick the ones where you won most or lost most and see what you did to get to this outcome. If you are puzzled then ask someone to give you a comment. Trial and error is the best way to get better. 
Redealing to the board in Pot Limit Omaha,"If I understand your question correctly, this is called ""running it twice"".  You can even ""run it three times"" (or four...) if you want.   It's sometimes done in live games (and the option existed in Full Tilt Poker too) when the players mutually agree to run it several times. Note that you're not forced to run it several times on the flop: you can ""run it twice"" on the turn too.  In that case you'll only run the river card twice (that is: dealing the river card two times in a row). Technically the goal is to lower the variance associated with pre-river all-ins.  When there are no more player decisions to be made but cards still to come, the outcome depends purely on luck (also called ""all-in luck"" by several software). Say you're 50/50 with a flush draw versus some made hand.  If you play normally (that is ""running it only once"") you'll typically either win the pot (you're running good, in that you're expected value is only 50% of the pot yet you won it all) or lose the pot (you're running bad: you lose everything although your expected value was 50% of the pot).  In some cases you'll split, but this is less common. Now if you run it twice you're more likely to split by winning the first run and losing the second one (or vice-versa). If one player wins both runs, it's exactly the same as if you had played a normal deal and the player had won the deal. I couldn't figure out what was gained by winning twice... Nothing special is ""gained"".  There's still the same amount of chips but that amount is divided in two (or three, etc.) stacks and the first stack goes to the winner of the first run and the second stack goes to the winner of the second run (typically players/dealer do not bother to split the chips before the end of the runs so that if there's only one winner, no time is lost counting/splitting the chips). Now there may be funny cases: imagine you have quads with 77 on a 877 board and your opponent has 88.  There's only one card left that can help him win the deal (the last 8, so that his quad 8888 would beat your quad 7777).  You can decide to ""run it twice"" and you're sure to win at least one of the two runs.   (numbers below are a bit approximate, it's late) Why would one do that?  Because it can be very tilting to be 95% favorite and to get a bad beat for a big pot.  So you'd rather run it twice and have 90% to win both runs and 10% to split instead of 95% to win and 5% to lose everything.  Your opponent may accept because he may prefer to have a 10% chance of splitting than only a 5% chance of winning everything."
"Handling ""running it twice"" situations","There is no reason to deviate from standard procedure of burning a card before the flop, turn, and river when dealing with an all-in situation - it saves nothing and can only cause confusion. Running it twice isn't really part of any official poker rules, so it will always follow the house rule. I would prefer that known cards not be reshuffled between - if the point is variance reduction, which it usually is, you have a better chance of realizing your true equity if the cards are not reshuffled."
How to analyze why I am losing?,"In general, you're playing too loosely. Since you show only aggregate info, it's impossible to pinpoint specific errors you're making, but there are some things about your charts that stand out and are important to address. Look at your losing table. Where are you losing most of your money?  It's the blinds. You're playing a lot of hands from the blinds and you're basically shoveling money in there when you do. You're playing 37% of hands from the small blind and raising 32%. That's really high, and you're losing 55 big blinds per 100 hands from that position.  Your big blind results aren't a lot better. I think you'd benefit from tightening up and defending and playing back a little less from the blinds. You should probably also be making more money from the button than from any other position, and you're not. Note that the button was the source of most of your profit in the first chart but it fares poorly in the second. People are often really skeptical of button open raises, especially when your pre-flop stats are already high, so you might want to tighten up. Your aggression frequencies are also quite high, especially on the flop. When you combine your high pre-flop VPIP and PFR stats with your high flop aggression frequencies, it probably means you're playing a lot of weak hands quite strongly. An effective strategy against this kind of player is just to play a tighter pre-flop range and get your good hands paid off. You're also folding to 3-bets infrequently given your pre-flop stats. Since you're playing a loose pre-flop range, you might want to give up more often to a 3-bet, particularly from out of position such as when you're in the small blind. This means you're putting money into the pot when you're usually behind and you don't have a positional advantage to compensate for it. You make the comment that you think you're folding too much, apparently based on the showdown percentages. I think that's misleading, because you're playing a slightly tighter range in the first chart, so you're more likely to win at showdown with that tighter range. It doesn't follow that you should fold less.  Maybe you could post some representative hands and solicit comments on specific play."
What are the odds of making a royal flush after the flop in Texas Hold 'Em?,"There are 2598960 unique 5-card poker hands (C(n,r) = C(52, 5) = 2598960). 4 of those are royal flushes. So, the odds of one specific player flopping a royal flush would be 4-in-2598960, or 1-in-649740."
Playings AA's deepstack vs drawing hands,"I don't see how you could not busted here with AA in a 3-man table. You make a big raise preflop of 4.5x and they both called; that seems a big raise but also on a very loose table, since a guy is calling around 20% of his stack with merely Q7s, so your move of overraising was good, you probably read the table of being very loose, since with AA you want to make people stay in the hand with lesser bets rather big. Both player calling created a large pot of around ~15k. Notice this is around 40% of your remaining stack and an SPR as small as 2.5. With such a small stack against such pot and obviously as strong hand as AA you're getting into pot-commiting waters if you're either call / bet now. And since you're going into pot-commiting either way and be the aggressor with a monster hand, you should: That move has these pros: Instead, you bet pretty big, although against loose players able to call easy-peasy any draw, without regard in their pot-odds vs draw, even if that pot-commits them largely. Think: Out of this, you didn't make any error, in my opinion most players would just busted here with AA against guys that pay little attention to pot odds, either pre-flop or post-flop, especially in 3-man table. Line 3 seems more appropriate to me, regarding the looseness of the table mostly. If they were raising monkeys with stats like 75/35, i would just limp preflop, make them build the pot before shoving my stack preflop."
Probability of flopping straight flush,"The worst case for a possible straight flush is holding something like A2s, AKs, A5s, etc., where there's only one possible way to flop the straight flush. In that case, the probability is one in 50C3, or 19600. The best case is 45s..TJs, which is 4 in 19600, because there are 4 ways to flop the straight flush. Hands like 58s are 2-ways, hands like 79s are 3-ways."
Real money poker on Android?,"You can play real money poker on both Pokerstars and PKR on android devices. I havent used either on android, but they are both pretty good on iOS."
Pocket Aces in 9-handed,"First of all if you can get someone to commit all of their chips pre flop when you hold Aces then you are doing well. You should be fist pumping at this stage as you are the favourite. If they suck out post flop then thats just varience you did the hard part getting all of your chips in pre which is +EV. You should always play the hand aggressively, but try not to get too attached when the board looks like it can hit a lot of draws. The best thing to do is try and put your opponents on a hand. If you raise pre and they re-raise, shove back over the top. If you raise and they call. Try and work out what sort of hand they can be calling you with based on your raise size. If you have them on something like AK and the flop looks nasty then re-evaluate your aggression. Make them pay a lot to see the next card if you think they are playing for a draw. If the flop is something like 10 J Q then still bet, but be careful. In general play it aggressively preflop and on the flop. But if you think a hand may have caught you up, do not be afraid to let go of your Aces."
NL100: River Shove with Ace-High?,"Pre-flop I don't think he'll re-raise the UTG opener (+ a caller) here that often with a mediocre / bad hand in this spot that often as a squeeze play. If he's aware of position, he'll more likely re-raise a MP or late opener. An UTG raise usually represents genuine strength. After his 3-bet there's  ~20BB in the pot. Calling would increase it to ~30BB and put you out of position. I'd 4-bet him to  ~40/45BB. He'll likely 5-bet you with a monster. If I decide to flat with AK I'll make sure I'm in position, out of position I want to take the pot right there. Flop If I just flatted with AK out of position and missed I'd probably give up at this point. This flop probably missed him too, depending on his c-betting percentage / aggression I might float and try to take it from him on a later street. You can use a flush scare card to your advantage should it arrive, but min-raising him makes this less believable. Just calling would make it more likely. Don't think you can rep a straight here often. Calling pre-flop and min-raising him here, he'll likely put you on a medium overpair 77 - TT, maybe even JJ. Most flush draws would probably just call, but always a chance you are semi-bluffing with one. Min-raise also comes accross kind of weak. You probably would have raised more with a strong hand (set of 6's for instance). He just calls, if he has a set he'll most likely be holding 66. Would expect him to come over the top with it. Also would expect him to just call on the button with a small pair hoping to spike a set. For now I'm putting him on overpair TT+, or a strong flush draw A:clubs:K:clubs:, A:clubs:Q:clubs:.... Turn That 4 likely did not help him or you. You don't mention any action on the turn and your shove on the river is equal to what you have left at this point (118.85BB), so I'm assuming it went check - check. Your checking basically announces that you were semi-bluffing and missed the flush. Most medium overpairs would have bet, but he can't rule it out yet. Maybe you were just intending to check-call for pot control fearing a bigger overpair. River The flush arrives. Slight overbet, but not that much. His range is mostly likely TT++, or a flush.  Let's assume he'll only 3-bet AK, AQ of clubs (if he has the flush). Other 3-bet hands might ofcourse include JJ+, AK / AQ of other suits...etc. That gives a total of 32 possible hands of which you are beating none. You can shove to represent the flush, he'll be hardpressed to call if he doesn't have it himself. But it's basically the only way you can win at this point. He'll most likely bet his flush, which you can't call and he'll check his overpair. So his range consists out of overpairs for the most parts, flush is a smaller part.
I think you are getting stacked here most of the time. Your line comes across as weak. Call, call 3-bet, min-raised low flop, check, shove. Think he will call here a lot of times thinking his overpair beats yours or put you outright on a bluff. Update: Some edits as I miscounted the AK / AQ combos."
Is gambling disease common among poker PROs who don't play other games?,"Most winning, disciplined grinders do not get involved in gambling in other games like roulette because they are disciplined. They are winning players because they understand the math behind poker and how to ensure that they have a winning edge over their opponents. Understanding the math behind poker will help them understand that playing games like roulette and slots is basically throwing money away.  This is not to say that no poker pros or winning poker players struggle with gambling addiction, which has to do with psychology and how the brain works.  I would make a rather safe assumption, thought, that winning poker pros are very unlikely to be gambling addicts. Poker pros would not be winning players if they had gambling problems. Winning in poker involves making decisions which have positive expected value in the long run, something that people with gambling problems would have a hard time doing. "
Side pot rules on not equal hands,"this is only possible if player A was all in, and player B had more chips in the pot after he bet with a third player (player C). Player A can only win the amount of his all-in from each player, then the rest of the chips in the pot forms a side pot. The side pot is then awarded to the player with the next best hand, in this case player B. as an example: Player A has 100 chips and is all in preflop, players B and C call and both have 50 chips remaining. The flop comes and players B and C get it in for their last 50 chips.  The turn and river are dealt and player A has the best hand, he is awarded 300 chips (100 from each of the other players). Player B has the next best hand, so he is rewarded the remaining chips (100) because there was no more action after his all-in. "
What are the rules of a misdeal in casinos?,"So I'm going to just copy and paste the TDA rules here as they are one of the most common set of rules enforced around the world, and often if a place is not using the official TDA rules, they're using a variant of it or something that was built off of it. In any case you should check with your local casino what they're doing as different places can have different rules, they will be somewhat similar to the below. I also added an explanation of some dealer terms you might not be familiar with from the TDA rules. TDA rules can be viewed here. 35:  Misdeals A: Misdeals include but are not necessarily limited to: 1) 2 or more boxed cards (boxed card is when a card is faceup in a deck of
  shuffled cards) on the initial deal; 2) first card dealt to the wrong
  seat; 3) cards dealt to a seat not entitled to a hand; 4) a seat
  entitled to a hand is dealt out; 5) In stud, if any player’s first 2
  downcards are exposed by dealer error; 6) In flop games, if 1 of the
  first 2 cards dealt off the deck or any other 2 downcards are exposed
  by dealer error. House standards apply for draw games (ex: lowball). B: Players may be dealt 2 consecutive cards on the button (see also Rule 37).   C: In a misdeal, the re-deal is an exact re-play: the button does not move, no new players are seated, and limits stay the same.
  Cards are dealt to players on penalty or not at their seats for the
  original deal (Rule 30), then their hands are killed. The original
  deal and re-deal count as one hand for a player on penalty, not two. D: Once substantial action occurs a misdeal cannot be declared; the hand must proceed (See Rule 36). 36:  Substantial Action (SA) Substantial Action is either A) any 2 actions in turn, at least one of
  which puts chips in the pot (i.e. any 2 actions except 2 checks or 2
  folds) or B) any combination of 3 actions in turn (check, bet, raise,
  call, fold). Posted blinds do not count towards SA. See Rules 35-D &
  44-B. So given the above let's use these rules on your situations you provided:"
