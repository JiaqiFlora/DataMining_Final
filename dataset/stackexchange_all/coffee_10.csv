How can I figure out how much caffeine is in my cup?,"I read everyone's answer and did some of my own research to find an estimation method that satisfies me and might be helpful to others too. I think it should be roughly Â±20% accurate. Weakly extracted coffee might yield 0.6% of its weight in caffeine and very strongly extracted coffee might get close to 1% caffeine.  These numbers are for typical 100% Arabica or mostly Arabica blends. 100% Robusta beans (uncommon) could be about double the caffeine. Explanation below: Typical premium roasted Arabica coffee beans like mine contain close to 1% caffeine by mass when measured by spectrophotometer (p 311)
though Robusta (less common and usually blended with Arabica in cheaper coffees) has
roughly twice that
much.  If you have a health concern like wanting to stay under the 300 mg guideline for pregnant women, you should be able to use this as the upper limit: each 10g of Arabica coffee contains about 100mg of caffeine. I use a 2 Tbsp scoop to measure beans before I grind them. One scoop of
beans weighs about 12 grams (yes I tared the scoop, but I did only weigh
once and am not comparing light or dark roasts which will vary in weight
and volume).  So if I eat that scoop of beans or grind them finely and drink them
with any amount of water I will be consuming the 120 mg (1% of 12g) of caffeine
present in them. That should be an upper limit to this estimation
exercise. The strongest or biggest/weakest cup of coffee I can brew with
that scoop of beans will have no more than 120mg caffeine.  Typical American-style brewing methods and water ratios result in 
1% (weak) to 1.65% (too strong) disolved coffee solids, with 1.25%
considered optimal whereas 
""a typical espresso will contain on average 1.8-2.2%""
solids So 1 fl oz of brewed coffee or espresso weighs almost the same as water
(29.57 g) and contains 1-2% coffee solids (so about 300-600mg, or 380mg solids for optimal brewed coffee and 600mg solids for espresso). That would be the upper limit if the coffee solids were pure caffeine, but they can't be.  On the other hand,the caffeine is probably more soluble than the other parts of the bean,so even though it's only 1% of the mass of the beans it's probably more than 1% of the dissolved solids. That's the hard part. Coffeechemistry.com says brewed coffee ends up with 8-15 mg caffeine per oz and espresso 30-50 mg caffeine per oz. That's a pretty huge range. It means caffeine is 2.5-4.0% of the solids (380 mg) in an ounce of ""optimal"" brewed coffee or 5.0-8.3% of the solids (600 mg) in an ounce of espresso. So: I typically make a nice strong 10 oz cup of coffee with my 12g of
beans containing a maximum of 120mg (or 1% of the coffee mass) caffeine. So let's say this maximum 12 mg caffeine per each oz of coffee corresponds to 1.65% or 500 mg solids (1.65% of 29.57 gr = 500 mg). In this case the 12 mg caffeine is 2.4% of the solids. If I brew it ""too weak"" and it ends up 1% solids (or 300 mg per oz) I would guess I'd proportionally get no more than 60% of the max caffeine, 7.2 mg (again 2.4% of the solids) per oz or 72 mg for a 10oz cup. So that narrows the range to 72-120 mg of caffeine in my cup depending on the brew strength. I'm guessing a good cup ends up somewhere in the middle, so I'm going to estimate my typical cup contains around 100 mg of caffeine from its 12g dry coffee, or about 80% of the maximum caffeine present in the beans. From this I would suggest a decent rule of thumb for ""optimal"" strength American-style brewed coffee is around 0.8% (or 0.008) of the mass of the beans used, or 80mg of caffeine for each 10g of dry coffee. Using the same method, a shot of espresso made with 7g of ground
coffee maxes out around 70mg caffeine (77mg if 10% Robusta sometimes typical for Espresso blends), but the serving size and strength are more standardized than brewed coffee, so the 64mg/shot reported by the USDA and others also ends up being 80-90% of the caffeine present in the beans."
How should I store whole bean coffee?,"In a cool, dark, dry, place and whenever possible vacuum sealed. The oils in roasted coffee degrade as they are exposed to air (oxidization) as well as heat. As with just about any foodstuff moisture accelerates the spoiling process as well. You should store your coffee in completely sealed, insulated, opaque containers. If you have the ability, vacuum pump the air out of the container for ultimate shelf-stability. Even without vacuum storage you can preserve beans for a long time by placing them inside a ziplock bag or coffee bag with a 1-way air seal and pushing as much air out as possible and then following the above method of airtight, dark and cool storage. Following these guidelines should help to ensure the freshness and flavor of the beans for as long as possible. "
"How will ""cold brewed"" coffee differ from traditional hot-water extraction methods?","My company builds flavor profiling and quality control tools for the craft beverage industry, using machine learning, data science, and analytical chemistry - let's use some of our 20,000+ coffee reviews to answer this question with data. It has been claimed for some time that cold brew as a method of extracting coffee only exists to minimize the amount of acidity in the flavor profile. This is only a third of the story, and may not be true for the coffee you brew or consume!  So what is the full story? Read on!   These two beautiful graphs show the difference in sour & acidity in cold Vs hot brewed coffee. The graphs show that hot brewed coffee has a much larger range in the perception of acidity - and is on average more acidic than its cold brewed counter part.  But what about the rest of the flavor profile? Are people really planning to cold brew for hours in advance just for marginally less sour acids in the brew?  No. Higher-end cafes and roasters are producing cold brew coffee to target consumers who want a different flavor profile- optimized for consumption at a different temperature.  For this section of the analysis, I will be using the Gastrograph to communicate complex flavor profiles consistently and simply. On the Gastrograph, the intensity is shown ranging from 0, the center of the graph, to 5 (the outer most point).   Let's look at the difference in flavor profiles below:  Full Immersion Cold Brew Coffee

This is the Gastrograph of the average Cold Brew Full Immersion Coffee.  Full Immersion Hot Brew Coffee

This is the Gastrograph of the average Hot Brew Full Immersion Coffee.  As you can see, these coffees differ on a much greater number of axis than simply sour and 
acidity - the goal is to make a different product with its own unique flavor profile, not to simply reduce acidity. Finally, Cold Brew is actually an entire class of production methods that involve infusing coffee into cold water. There are 2 primary types:  (Reminder: Coffee brewed with hot water, and then iced is not Cold Brew coffee.)  Full Immersion Cold Brew Ice Drip  Let's look at the 2 most interesting types of cold brews from the list above: Stumptown Draft Cold Brew  
 This coffee is served from a beer keg and pressurized with CO2.  Stumptown Nitro Cold Brew  This coffee is served from a beer keg and pressurized with nitrogen; the effect is a much smoother and fuller coffee, with a very thick and present mouth feel. 
 The cold brew coffee you make at home will be much closer to the average cold brew shown in the previous section, as I suspect few of the readers here will be making batches large enough to keg!  How do the concentration of compounds salicylic acid, phenolic acids, and amino acids differ between cold brew and hot brewed coffee? It is not so much concentration that matters - it's perception. For example, phenolic acids are mostly volatile; in hot coffee more are evaporating, thus you can more easily perceive them. The same is true for salicylic acid (a precursor to aspirin, which is acetylsalicylic acid).  Also, These acids are more readily soluble and easier to extract in hotter environments. In cold brew not only do you extract fewer molecules of the acid, but the ones that you do extract will trigger a less potent olfactory response. Amino acids are a trickier issue. The chemical nature of amino acids greatly varies (like in polarity and size, functional groups, etc). Most free amino groups will be consumed during roasting via Maillard non-enzymatic browning. On average, the cold brew would extract more, simply because it would have more time to come out of the coffee (during the average 6-hour steep time).  This article is helpful: Coffee Brewing Chemistry: Hot Brew vs. Cold Brew."
Why is it not recommended to drink coffee immediately after it's roasted?,"Fresh off the roast, coffee has high levels of carbon dioxide and nitrogen (based?) gasses. These gasses will greatly contribute to retro-nasal activity as well as initial flavors (think carbonated water). The most apparent flavor one gets from this is metallic. At my work, 4 days is considered minimum for serving and tasting, although there's always exceptions. "
"Why isn't coffee commonly sold in sachets, like tea bags?","As a matter of fact, coffee is ""commonly"" sold in some kind of sachets. In Japan, there is what is called ""one-drip bag coffee"". It consists of a flat sachet that you can unfold to deploy a small scaffold. The scaffold adapts to any mug-like cups. It unveils a filter containing ground coffee, as it unfolds. You just need to pour hot water in the filter to get a decent cup of coffee. I will not link to any maker or brand, but most coffee dealers in Japan offer these bags---pretty convenient and offering a decent cup for the price. These bags seem somewhat popular in Japan. I am not sure about global availability, though. Several countries do not sell them (e.g. Europe, perhaps because of the French / Italian influences).  "
What's the most effective way of generating crema from an Aeropress?,"Here's a quick rundown of the Aeropress method I use every morning. I end up with a relatively crema-y shot. You'd never mistake it for one from an espresso machine, but there's a good layer all across the top. This is completely unscientific and I can't identify which steps here are the relevant ones for the good results, but maybe if you experiment with some of these adjustments you can identify what works and what doesn't. The beans I use vary; I generally grab a light or medium roast off the shelves at Trader Joes and grind it one click down from the finest setting on the in-store grinder. (The finest setting purports to be for Turkish coffee; the one I use is labeled 'espresso'.) I store the ground coffee in its can in the fridge for up to a week or a week and a half, depending on how long it takes me to drink it all. Today I'm using Trader Joe's Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee, a delightful medium roast. (I just now learned that Serious Eats says it's the best bet for Trader Joe's coffee.) Melted snow from the Wasatch Mountains, filtered through whatever the county of Salt Lake does before it gets to my kitchen tap, and heated on the stove until just before the boil. There are tiny bubbles forming on the bottom of the kettle, but few of them are rising to the surface of the water. I'm pretty loosey-goosey about my brewing method, but the results are very consistent. This leads me to believe it's the equipment and the beans that are generating the great results, not anything I'm doing right. As I pay more attention each morning, I've noticed a couple more things: For the past few weeks I've been casually experimenting with my morning coffee and coming up with very inconclusive results. (As I mentioned below, all I've come up with are a bunch of totally surefire ways to absolutely demolish the crema, and no methods of preserving it.) This half-butted casual science ends now! I just bought a hand grinder and an app full of AeroPress recipes; thusly armed, I'm going to experiment more formally. Well, a little more formally. I'll track the results here and update this answer when and if I come up with a reliable way to generate and preserve the foam on my AeroPress shots. The results are in: I've figured out how to stop killing my crema. It turns out that the combination of freshly ground beans and the mesh metal filter is somehow stopping the crema from getting through to the cup. Eight attempts with hand-ground beans failed miserably, and my first attempt after reverting to store-ground beans (with the 'somewhat loosey-goosey' method above) generated a nice layer of foam in the cup. However, the plot thickens. My colleague Robert asserts: Never had a problem getting crema with aeropress. Lots of fresh coffee ground to a powder, very little very hot water. Makes my ubercoffee syrup shots I talked about a year or more ago... with plenty o crema. Dilute to taste (which I never did < jitter >). ...and I'm not entirely sure, but if memory serves, switching to the fine metal mesh filter meant bye-bye to crema. It's been a bit too long to remember for certain. I just reused the same paper filter over and over for months (actually, I used two to keep them from blowing out). So it would seem that: I'd be interested to see others' results from experiments like these."
What is the hexagon funnel shaped thing that came with my aeropress for?,"It took me an embarrassingly long time to realize the purpose of this hexagon shaped funnel, so I am sharing this via a self posted answer. The hexagon funnel has three purposes: It is a funnel to make it easier to pour your ground coffee into the aeropress opening.  It is a funnel for cups with a small opening at the top. The image shows a shot-glass as an example. Trying to use an aeropress with a cup that is too small sucks.  It is a stand, so when your aeropress is stowed, it all neatly stacks together. "
When does coffee go off?,"Whole bean coffee will go stale within 14 days - on average. The graph below shows the quick 1.5 standard deviation drop in quality within the first 14 days (marked in red). *See note below for details  Staling in the context of coffee has a commonly agreed on definition - the loss of volatile aromatic compounds and the oxidation of surface oils on the roasted coffee beans. The loss of aromatics affects the flavor profile because: 1) they are both part of the same degradation process and 2) the majority of what you taste in coffee is flavors from volatile aromatics through retronasal olfactory sensation. This graph was created using data from Analytical Flavor Systems where we build quality control and flavor profiling tools for craft beverage producers. Perceived Quality is a non-hedonic assessment of a product's quality. This time series is taken from a degradation study.   Ground coffee, on the other hand, will stale within minutes. 70 cc of ambient air is enough to render one pound of coffee stale. On average, this process takes seven minutes.  Interestingly, the degradation curve looks about the same!  This time series model was segmented using daily Perceived Quality means from a random selection of 15,000 coffee reviews. All coffees included are whole bean, freshly ground, third wave coffee brewed in a Chemex with a bleached filter.  Certain other brewing methods, particularly methods optimized for older coffee such a Nel, may show a different degradation curve.  The staling point was selected by a parametric statistical change point analysis, which searches for shifts in the mean and variance of a time series. This time series was modeled for change point analysis using a Poisson distribution as  we're searching for the average number of coffees that go stale within a specific time-point, and the model was set to find at most one change."
How can I minimize the amount of grounds at the bottom of my French press coffee?,"I have the same problem, and these things definitely reduce it: Finally, if none of that works for you, try a different brew method. Paper filters are very good at keeping grounds out of your cup."
Does the hardness of water matter when making coffee?,"Yes. That is to say it will definitely affect flavor, but how it affects the flavor is ultimately dependent upon the specific mineral compounds found in your hard water vs. other hard waters and soft water's lack of these compounds. Here's the key: Some of the compounds in hard water are ""sticky,"" glomming onto certain compounds in coffee when they meet (in your coffeemaker). The more eugenol the water hangs on to, for example, the woodsier the taste of your coffee will be. Magnesium is particularly sticky, meaning water that's high in magnesium will make coffee with a stronger flavor (and higher levels of caffeine). Hard water can also have high levels of bicarbonate, though, which Hendon found could lead to more bitter flavors coming through.  - A Chemist Has Uncovered A Secret To Brewing Delicious Coffee At Home Business Insider. So depending on flavor preferences you might prefer your hard water at home but dislike it at work or simply prefer soft water altogether. Traditionally hard water is actually sought after for other beverage processes like beer brewing because of some of the abilities described above."
What is the process to reduce bitterness in coffee?,"There are a lot of factors that contribute to the bitterness of coffee. Some of these have to do with the concentration of various compounds in the coffee and the roasting process, but the way you brew the coffee can make a big difference as well. Assuming that you are not going to be harvesting and roasting your own coffee, we can focus on the brewing process. Buying Beans: Robusta vs Arabica To decrease perceived bitterness in coffee, the best choice is Arabica. Arabica beans are often sweeter with notes of sugars and fruits and a somewhat wine-like acidity. Robusta on the other hand tends to be harsher with more bitterness. This difference in quality is reflected in cost however, as Arabica tends to be more expensive than Robusta. In terms of roast level, medium roasts generally contain fewer soluble solids, more acidity and a stronger aroma than dark roasts. All of these should contribute to making medium roasts on average less bitter than dark roasts. Water: Temperature and Chemistry You have to find the sweet spot when it comes to temperature, a little trial and error can be used here depending on the blend and brewing method. For example, the people at AeroPress recommend a much lower temperature to reduce bitterness that what you would use in a french press. In general research has shown that coffee brewed in hot water is perceived to be less bitter than when cold water is used. Additionally, bitterness is reduced when hard or soft water is used when compared to distilled water. Brewing [Extraction] Bitterness is strongly correlated with the amount of dissolved solids in the brewed coffee. To ensure that the amount of dissolved solids and the overall extraction is correct (and minimally bitter), make sure to use the correct grind coarseness, water temperature, and brew time for your chosen method. Over extraction can be a major cause of bitterness. Drip and pour-over brewing methods tend to have less bitterness than a french press or other immersion methods. This can be attributed to less dissolved solids in the coffee.  SCIENCE Much of this section will be outside the control of most, but it is interesting nonetheless.  Research has found that the introduction of polyphenols reduces the bitterness of coffee. The metallic bitterness found in some coffee has been attributed to  dicaffeoylquinic acids. Trigonelline is perceived as bitter at concentrations of 0.25% and its degredation is proportional to roast level. Roasting Trigonelline produces a byproduct called pyridines and helps create the roasty aroma found in some coffee. Chlorogenic acid is also found in coffee, higher concentrations in Robusta than Arabica, and that contributes to the bitterness as well. Additionally, Quinic acid is a product formed from the degradation of Chlorogenic acid and is present in coffee at twenty times its taste threshold, contributing to the bitterness. Furfuryl alcohol is also known to increase the bitterness of coffee. More Information Coffee Chemistry: Cause of Bitter Coffee Coffee Basics: The Difference Between Arabica and Robusta"
Is Kopi Luwak safe to drink?,"Yes, it's perfectly safe to drink and extremely delicious. In The Philippines, we often call this 'Kopi Alamid', and it truly is one of the rarest coffees on the planet. At around $20 per 75 grams (local price), it's also one of the world's most expensive coffees.  The palm civet is a nocturnal cat (well, more like a ferret, but technically a cat) that eats the berries (beans) and is extremely picky in its diet. For the civet to choose a bean, it has to be just right when it comes to the aroma, and given the sensitivity of this creature's nose, said aroma means the bean is perfect. Some say the digestive process itself lends to better flavor, it can be a matter of heated debate depending on where you ask ;) The thing is, the cat doesn't digest the whole bean, just the outer pulp. Farmers follow them around and wait for nature to take its course, then the beans are processed in a very safe manner. Farmers typically get just a kilo or so a day, it's quite an intensive process. I drink it as often as I can afford to do so, and I have never gotten sick. It's a partly fruity, partly nutty and just an all over cozy and relaxing taste that I highly recommend if you're able to get the coffee. Just be prepared to pay quite a bit, and ready to consume it quickly after getting it home (it does not keep as well as others, probably due to local transportation issues prolonging the time it takes from roasting to actually get to market). If you have a hand-powered burr grinder, I recommend using it and grinding pretty gingerly, even the heat of most ceramic grinders is enough to lose a little bit of the fruity taste you'd otherwise get. Really, treat these beans like royalty, they're that good. If you buy some, try to avoid buying from farms with captive civets - the growing popularity of this coffee has led to a cottage trapping industry, which is (unfortunately) likely to seriously endanger them soon."
Are robusta and arabica the only bean varieties?,"There are several varieties of coffee that have all derived from the three species of Coffea genus of the Rubiaceae family:   As you can see from this Counter Culture graph, each variety has a unique lineage, likely designed to grow well in a specific climate and geographical region while producing a unique profile once brewed. Coffee can be treated much like Wine: terroir and variety is key to growth, but then roasting and brewing is also extremely important for the final cup. Several artisanal single-origin roasts will feature tasting notes, variety, and growing region to accommodate your shopping experience when reviewing what is in season. A Bourbon variety grown in the volcanic region of El Salvador will brew a completely different experience compared to the highly-prized Gesha variety grown in Columbia, even though they can both be traced back to the Arabica species. For more info on what to expect from these varieties, check out the Stumptown Guide to Coffee Varieties."
I run my espresso machine until my whole cup is full. What's my coffee called?,I'd say that it's a caffÃ¨ crema which is generally made the way you make your coffee and is about 240 ml. It's about 3 times more water than a normale.
What is the science (if any) behind bulletproof coffee?,"Another view on this: Bulletproof coffee is often used with a low-carb diet, often referred to as the ""keto diet"", which has some similarities with Paleo, but is quite different. The diet requires you to cut out as many carbohydrates as possible out of your diet in order to get your body into a state of ketosis, where most of the energy in the body is produced by processing fat instead of carbohydrates. When following the keto diet, you need to eat a lot of fat, minimum carbohydrates and a reasonable amount of protein. The goal is to get most of your calories from fat. Getting in all the fat that is required is often difficult, so in that context, bulletproof coffee is nothing more than a delivery method for fat. There's nothing special about it, it's just easier to drink a spoonful of butter melted in coffee than eating it on its own. If you want to read up on keto further, the keto reddit has lots of resources on it: Keto In A Nutshell."
Did people actually drink coffee off the saucer?,"In fact, it seems that people would drink both from the cup and from the saucer: After being served a hot beverage (e.g., coffee or tea) in a cup on top of a saucer, some would pour a small amount of the beverage onto the saucer, and then drink from the saucer. There's evidence that this was reasonably common into the 20th century, and evidence that some still do, for a variety of possible reasons! Though I've never seen this practice in person, the following is what I have aggregated from a bit of online searching. A blog post contains some good links about the topic. I find the most compelling of them to be an article that discusses the use of deep saucers for this practice; the saucer is larger and deeper like a shallow bowl, alleviating some of the awkward logistical aspects of drinking from a flat or shallow saucer. Another anecdote, according to US government legend, George Washington (in a discussion with Thomas Jefferson) used the literal practice (cooling-off beverages in a saucer) as a metaphor for the cooling-off that occurs in the upper house of a bicameral legislature. Even if this exact exchange is embellished, it still suggests that the practice was common enough to be in the vernacular. Fundamentally, pouring part of a hot beverage into a saucer would help cool it down faster. Many anecdotal sources have that as an assumed motivation; if you're in a hurry to start drinking your beverage (and are a bit careful about the pouring and the saucer-sipping) it's a practical way of doing so. Some other anecdotes suggest that it was fashionable or polite (maybe even fun?) -- perhaps like eating peas off the back of one's fork. Cooling a portion in the saucer would alleviate the need for potentially-impolite-seeming slurping or blowing across the beverage to cool it, substituting instead acrobatic-prowess-demonstrating yet possibly-more-polite sipping off of a saucer.  Other discussion forums (one example) contain some additional anecdotes and pictures."
"Chemically, what's happening to coffee after it's brewed?","The biggest chemical change that is going to occur is going to be oxidation. Chemically, oxidation is defined as the following from this source. Oxidation is any reaction in which one or more electrons
  are moved from one chemical to another, producing two different
  compounds. Specifically related to coffee, oxidation is further elaborated upon as: In coffee, the most common process is that an oxygen molecule donates
  two electrons to a compound, forming a new (differently perceived)
  compound and bonding with hydrogen to form water. Oxidation of coffee occurs when oxygen molecules (present in the air in your flask and also dissolved in the water used to brew the coffee) come into contact with different compounds in the coffee. Even if you had no air whatsoever in the flask, this process would still happen due to the dissolved oxygen in the water used to make the coffee. The process of oxidation occurs much more readily at higher heats, hence the reason why cold brewed coffee does not go stale as quickly.  When the oxygen combines with the hydrogen, water is created. That hydrogen ion, when it was free, was adding to the acidity of the coffee. Once it is no longer free and connected to the oxygen, in the form of water, the pH of the coffee will rise slightly, making the coffee more bitter. This is can be perceived as 'staleness'. The compounds which are oxidized are the acids, aromatics, and oils.  All of these give your coffee it's great taste. As the coffee cools, the molecules will vibrate more slowly. This leads to a drop in temperature and will occur in any container, no matter how good it is. Since you have described a situation with minimal heat loss, this process is negligible. The oxidation causes the coffee to become stale. This is a bean roasters worst nightmare. For the brewed coffee, it dismantles aromatics, acids, and oils - all key contributors to the coffee's flavor. It also raises the pH to make it more bitter and adds water to the mix. So no, it won't taste the same at 5 pm as it would poured first thing in the morning. The taste of the coffee will change over the course of the day. Answering your final question about duration of freshness: How long will your coffee stay fresh in a perfect flask? That is a matter of opinion. Every coffee shop has a different standard for how long they let their brewed coffee sit. It can be 15 minutes to an hour. As soon as you roast a bean, it begins to stale. As soon as you grind coffee, it begins to stale. As soon as you brew coffee, it begins to stale. It's hard to qualify what you will consider to be 'fresh'. A purist will tell you that unless you consume the coffee immediately, your coffee will be stale. As I said, it is a matter of opinion, and if you have the perfect flask, I would say you could wait about an hour before your coffee becomes stale. That's just me though. The sooner you drink it the better. Ensure there is little to no air left in your flask. You might also look into cold brewing. If you want to read more about these chemical processes as they apply to coffee throughout the preparation process (roasting, grinding, brewing), then you can check out this resource.

How to avoid soya milk curdling in coffee?,"It seems that the cause of the situation of curdling soya milk in coffee is that the acid from the coffee curdles the proteins and/or fats in the (soya or other) milk, being catalysed by the heat of the coffee; so that's what needs to be mitigated. There are a couple related questions on Cooking.SE, including this one that suggests adding salt to the coffee will help a little (table salt, or even bicarb / baking soda).
I have tried adding table salt to the coffee first, then adding the coffee to the soya milk, and it seems to help (a little, sometimes; YMMV). Another Cooking.SE question also suggests waiting for coffee to cool. The linked TheKitchn article (linked from the aforementioned previous question and @PythonMaster's answer) suggests that cooling the coffee, or pouring coffee into the soya milk (rather than the other way around) helps via similar mechanisms. In my experience in messing around with this, I have not found the order of adding ingredients makes much difference (i.e., putting coffee into the soya milk). It absolutely depends on the type of coffee, also, because different coffees will have different degrees of acidity.  See also this table about relative acidity levels. However, it is certainly the case that adding coffee into the milk will be helpful in general (compare also to tempering of eggs or adding acid into water rather than the other way around).  In this order, these allow temperature and acid (respectively) to more slowly come into balance between the two substances as they are being combined. IMHO, I have found the brand (i.e., the ingredients and production methods) of the soya milk to be the biggest factor. I (personally, with not-entirely-scientific -- yet! -- trials) find that soya milk brands that contain emulsifiers (or other additives) are less likely to curdle in coffee.  My only guesses are that I generally prefer to avoid the additives, so this is an unfortunate conclusion for me personally. Freshness of the milk is also an issue; milk of all types will spoil and slowly start to curdle due to natural processes (fermentation, bacteria, other contamination). There's another question about storing soya milk in the freezer, where we reached similar conclusions. At the risk of making this an even longer answer, here are some other things to try: I'm interested (fascinated, even; obsessed, maybe?:) ) with this, so I'd really like to hear feedback. Of the dozens of articles I've read on this, I've still not found a proper solution. Happy experimenting; comments welcomed."
What roast level is recommended for cold brew?,"I'm going to answer this in terms of flavor, and then acidity. Generally, people choose more lightly roasted coffee to preserve the terroir flavors of the bean. These flavors usually come from unstable molecules that deteriorate quickly after the coffee is brewed. When coffee is brewed and consumed relatively quickly, the drinker can enjoy those flavors. Cold brew produces a more muddled mixture of flavors and relies more on mouthfeel and big flavors like sweetness, savory, earth, chocolate, etc. More delicate precise flavors are lost. It is also important to note that some fruit, vegetal, and herbal flavors are enhanced by the presence of acid, like adding lemon juice and tarragon to a fish filet. So, if you are trying to avoid acid but you love the fruitiness of say, a medium roasted Kenyan single origin, you could cold brew it and see if you still get the flavors you want. If you hear about another light roasted coffee that has strong sweetness but is more acidic than you usually like, try it as a cold brew. I.e. if acid is what is holding you back with specific coffees you want to try, try them as a cold brew. Just know that the lack of acid in the cold brew may make it a little lack-luster compared to a traditional cup, especially since tasting notes are made when evaluating hot brewed cup. Darker roasted coffee as already lost more of the bean flavors and gained more roast flavors. If anything, I would say that a darker roast is going to have a more consistent flavor between hot and cold brewing simply because more of the delicate flavors have already been burned away. I would bet that Kicking Horse and Blue Bottle suggest a medium roast for cold brew because a medium roast preserves the beans own characteristics while introducing the roast flavors. This is why single origins are usually roasted to full city or less. In summary, I would suggest that you find a coffee you like already as a French press or pour over and cold brew that regardless of roast. Lighter roasts may lose some of their complexity in a cold brew, darker roasts will mellow even more in a cold brew. As backwards as it is, I hope this helps!"
Should I rinse paper coffee filters before use?,"Do you have maker with a removable filter basket? (Like the photo I attached below.) If so, then you might try what I've done:  The support of the basket protects against failures. And while you won't be able to rinse the reverse side easily, you will be able to get enough water into it to saturate through the paper. (Those flakes you mention will be trapped between the reverse of the filter and the basket.) Hot versus Cold? I'd use warm. Some things you're removing may be more soluble at higher temperatures. I wouldn't go to the trouble of heating pre-filtered water. there is something to be said for water temperature affecting the filtering qualities of the paper by expanding the fibers, and in turn spaces between fibers. But without testing we'll have to assume it's a minor. If you only have cold filtered water, I suggest you use that.  Why not hot water? First, a quick rinse of hot water isn't going to neutralize significantly more micro organisms that cold. You need boiling or much higher for a length of time to do that. Second, hot water will make the filter more prone to breaking. I have brewed simultaneous batches with rinsed and non-rinsed; I taste exactly no difference This leads me to think that soaking is worth a try. If it works for rice to remove excess starch, it might work similarly with paper A slightly different angle on this:  Try to find the filters that don't need rinsing. When I filter I'm doing so to reduce the cholesterol raising impact of coffee. I prefer the taste of unfiltered coffee, but the evidence convinces me that filtered coffee is better for my cholesterol. The study linked below, amongst others, shows that paper filters remove much of the cholesterol-raising compounds, as much as ""80% of the lipid-solublue substance that was present..."" Pre-wetting the paper --pre-loading the fibers with water, really-- seem as though it would reduce this absorbent property, although I can't back that up. The hypercholesterolaemic factor in boiled coffee is retained by a paper filter"
How do brown and white paper filters compare?,"There are many difference between the two filters. In this website. it states that: Today, most white paper filters are whitened with oxygen. Oxygen whitening is much more friendly to the environment, and imparts no taste to the filter. Brown filters are simply unwhitened. Your choice, but oxygen whitened filters are usually less expensive. Brown filters are just plain without any improvements. Surprisingly, they are more expensive yet yields the same flavor as a white filter here. Trying to save money, get a white one. In this website,it states that: Avoid white coffee filters that have been whitened with cholrine bleaching. These types of filters have a lower quality than natural brown or white ones using natural oxygen methods. Performance may vary though. Look online like in Amazon for high quality paper filters and look at the reviews. Yep, some brown paper filters will add some extra taste to your coffee, sometimes not that good: Melitta 'whites' are best. I use them, as they are oxygenated, not bleached. I don't care for any of the brown filters. I have used the Filtropa/Aroma (browns) and the Chemex and didn't care for them. Many brown filters introduce a wet cardboard taste into the brew. Hario is an exception but they are pricey. Brown paper filters add a wet cardboard taste to your coffee. That just makes your coffee less enjoyable. As said in the performance section, white filters are probably better (if only implied with natural oxygen methods to get the white). Hario is a brown paper filter that acts like a white paper filter, adding no extra, disgusting flavor into your coffee. It is rather expensive though. Here is the website where all the information of this section came from. Well here is a paragraph about a study by Harvard about paper filters and such: According to Harvard Health Publications, paper filters are more effective at eliminating diterpenes than permanent or cloth filters. Paper filters are also easier to clean up -- you dispose of them after one use. Cloth and permanent filters must be cleaned after every use. Paper filters are not as environmentally friendly as the other types of filters, but since theyâre made of natural fibers, they are biodegradable. To make paper filters more âgreen,â compost them along with your coffee grounds. For composting, natural brown filters are better than bleached white filters. Paper filters aren't as eco-friendly as others but can are biodegradeable, unlike plastic which takes forever and metal, which probably takes even longer. Paper filters can even be used as compost with your coffee grounds. It will make good fertilizer with the rest of your compost. Using normal brown paper filters is preferred over bleached white filters. Production is nearly the same. A white paper filter is really a brown paper filter that is bleached or has added oxygen. Here is the website that provided the paragraph. Not a lot of differences that are outright clear, but there are minor differences between the two. I hope this helps you!"
Brewing with the same coffee grounds twice?,"In general, I argue that you shouldn't be able to re-use the grounds. That is, for any brewing session, your goal is to extract exactly what you want from the beans. If you do this optimally for your method and taste, there's nothing left in the beans that you want; re-extracting will give you a different result. The second brew might be drinkable and even tasty, but it will have a disproportionately small amount of stuff you might want, like caffeine and other flavour compounds.  That said, @Madmanta's answer makes a good point: it might work in some cases, such as Aeropress or espresso. But this suggests you might want to change other parameters of your brewing. If you can re-brew your coffee with a result that you like, you might be able to, for example, use less grounds. This saves money, which sounds like it's part of your goal. Alternatively, you could brew a larger cup of coffee with the same amount of beans, or increase the extraction time. In the case of AeroPress, for example, I find that many of the recipes are decidedly under-extracted, so this might be an explanation for why a second brew works for you; see this Q/A for what I mean by extraction in this case. You could try this experimentally also: brew a cup of Aeropress or pour-over as you usually do, then brew another batch in the same way. For example, I find the last few drops of pour-over brew to be watery and off-tasting but the entire batch tastes better together than either of the two parts separately. If you like it, go for it. Or use half the amount of grounds the next time. :) As a practical note, you might also consider simply to brew a larger batch of coffee all in one go. You'll get a slightly different product but, for example, I find that I use way less grounds for a 10-cup thermal carafe than for 10 individual cups."
How can I cost-effectively improve the coffee supply in my company break room?,"The easiest step would be to swap out the Maxwell House coffee for something of higher quality.  If there are local roasters nearby, check to see if they do wholesale or bulk orders, and then order some 5lb. bags of coffee from them.  Since the idea is to keep costs low, they should be able to grind it for you ahead of time so that you won't have to add the cost of a grinder for the time being."
What is the background of brewing coffee with eggs?,"So I did a bit of research, and found a number of regional claims to 'egg coffee', including  Swedish, Norwegian, Vietnamese and the American Mid-West. Of course I also found an article on Putting Weird Things In Coffee, which should be taken with a pinch of salt1. There seem to be a variety of approaches, but they seem to fall into three main camps: Across the different techniques, adding the shell was the only real unifying theme! It's said to reduce bitterness (I imagine because the shell is essentially calcium-carbonate, which is basic). The technique is to just crush up the shell, mix it and the egg contents with the coffee and pour over boiling water. The grounds will bind with the egg protein and sink in the cup. They can then be strained off. The only other recipe I found is specifically for Vietnamese egg coffee, which I found here: Brew a small cup of Vietnamese coffee. Crack
an egg and discard the whites. Put the yolk and the sweetened
condensed milk in a small, deep bowl and whisk vigorously until you
end up with a frothy, fluffy mixture like the one above. Add a
tablespoon of the brewed coffee and whisk it in. In a clear coffee cup
(weâre going for aesthetics here), pour in your brewed coffee, then
add the fluffy egg mixture on top. Presto. Egg coffee.  1: No, not like that."
How to grow coffee at home?,"It is possible to grow coffee indoors. If allowed to grow as a tree they can reach 8 feet tall but if trimmed occasionally you can get the plant to grow more like a bush around 3-4 feet. This will change some based on the exact type. Coffee plants prefer shade with a couple hours of direct sunlight in the morning. Keeping it by a window should be about right. Depending on your climate you want to be careful taking it outside during winter. As J Musser mentioned, this will be a long process that will yield very little, but it can be done. On the plus side, coffee plants are evergreens and look very nice as indoor plants. You can read more here. Edit: Stealing @JMussers comments to add to my answer One large apartment plant will only produce enough coffee for a few cups worth each year, and that's after years of growth. They do look good, though. My point was, indoor coffee plants aren't that effective. Outdoors, a good plant will produce around 2-3 lbs. of grean beans per year. They are usually planted about 8'x8' apart, or a near equivalent, so 680 plants per acre, = around 1700 lbs of green coffee per acre per year, under good conditions."
What coffees are the least acidic?,"Lets answer this question with some data! My company uses machine learning, data science, and sensory science to build flavor profiling and quality control tools for the craft beverage industry.  I will use a lot of graphs, because a picture is worth a thousand words but a graph can communicate a concept, to dispel a lot of the myths about acidity in coffee.  TL;DR: Roast level is the Primary determinant of sour and acidity in coffee, where lighter roast has more natural acid compounds left unbroken from maillard reaction and strecker degradation (non-enzymatic browning).  This is closely followed by Altitude, green processing, and finally age of the coffee.  Based on 10,000+ reviews, their seems to be little indication that you can determine the sourness or acidity of a coffee simply by where its grown!  Now, this lack of effect would disappear if we controlled for the altitude the coffee was grown at. Why? Because higher altitude plants are under more stress, forcing them to be more efficient - less leafs, less fruit, but each leaf has a higher respiratory rate, and each fruit is more potent!   This graph shows the difference in distribution of Sour & Acidity of washed coffee vs natural processed coffee. There is a very small difference in the skew and kurtosis, but it is statistically significant.  Washed Coffee brewed in a Chemex is on average more acidic than its natural washed counterpart. Why? This is most likely a cognitive, not chemical, effect. Because natural processed coffees ferment with bits of remnant fruit (the coffee cherry) they retain more sugars, some of which are preserved though the roasting process. The increase in fruity esters and sugar compounds masks the acidity - so even though there's about equal amounts, you taste it less in the natural processed coffees.   If you really want to avoid any acidity in coffee, you could drink it stale! But I don't suggest it - stale coffee lacks the caffeine and interesting flavors that make coffee wonderful.  This plot shows the rate of acid degradation in coffee from its first day since roast. The red line marks the 14th day from roast, when the average coffee goes stale.   This graph shows Sour and Acidity as a function of the level of roast; as roast increases, the average perception of acidity decreases (in coffee brewed in a chemex). The grey field shows the Standard Error within the fit.  You should note, why is the error so high at the highest level of roast? These are coffees considered ""French"" or ""Italian"" or even ""Spanish"" roasts - you should consider these coffees burnt. The fruity and interesting acids such as malic, phosphoric, and citric have been destroyed by prolonged heat exposure in the roaster, and these coffees contain acrylamide, a carcinogen, which is not only bad for you, but also tastes terrible.  The levels of acrylamide, a known carcinogen, peak early in the
  roasting process (at about 120 sec).  While acrylamide is still
  detectable in fully roasted and burnt coffees, it most likely donât
  contribute to the unpleasant, burnt flavor in over-roasted coffee. 
  Multiple studies suggest that the main chemicals that cause bad
  flavors in burnt coffee are heterocyclic aromatic amines and
  polyaromatic hydrocarbons.  These increase with roasting temperature
  and time and many compounds that fall into these categories are known
  or suspected carcinogens. An extension to this question, reviewing the differences in the level of acidity by brewing method has been answered here: Could preparation method make coffee more acidic?"
Is Nespresso 'real' espresso?,"Akin to the simultaneous fates of SchrÃ¶dinger's Cat, answers to your question include no, maybe, and it doesn't matter. I have furthermore been unable to avoid philosophical diversion and hypothetical questions in this answer; please forgive me. :) As @EricPlaton noted in comments, the answer depends on a slightly different question: What characteristics define real espresso? Here I merely compare the beverages produced by the following: My answers: In simple point of fact, espresso is not traditionally made with a coffee-filled capsule, so the beverage produced by capsule-based machines might be disqualified from being called espresso on that trivial issue alone. :) If you subscribe to the INEI being a benchmark of espresso production standards (PDF), capsule systems may not meet INEI parameters... so if they don't, they're not an espresso on technicality alone, with regard to ""Certified Italian Espresso"" at least. For example: There have been several taste-tests of questionable ""legitimacy"" between capsule-based machines and traditional espresso machines. One four-subject test gave higher marks to the beverage produced from a capsule-based machine than a traditional espresso machine. This one agrees. Another test disagreed, giving a capsule-based machine a scathing review. Maybe there are better reviews out there; these are mostly useful for anecdotes. As you note, the resulting beverage from a capsule-based espresso system is similar to traditional espresso, crema and all. However, if you ordered an espresso from a proper cafe, and they gave you a beverage that was brewed using a capsule-based machine, would you feel cheated on principle? What if the beverage was indistinguishable from traditional espresso... or if you like the capsule-based system's result better? This is my personal conclusion. The result of the beverage produced by a capsule-based system is a decent replica of proper espresso. Capsule systems also are likely to produce a consistent result. If you like the beverage that results (see above...), what difference does it make if it's ""real"" espresso or not? [1] Is AeroPress espresso? I think not (and @Chris in AK agreed and notes ""Aerpresso"" in comments!), but that's a separate question also..."
Is it possible to burn coffee while brewing?,"Burn? I've heard that some large chains ""burn"" their beans while roasting :-) But not while brewing. A major coffee chain, seen on almost every other corner in some places, is known for their very dark, ""burnt"" roast. Many people like this sharp taste and associate it with caffeine and their morning pick-me up. Other people find this ""burnt"" roast to be overwhelming and consider this heavy roast to be destructive when using high-quality beans. In any case the burning happens at roast - not when brewing."
What do I need to start cold-brewing?,"There are two ways to start with: plunging and dripping. The slowly / ""much slower"" part means about 8-12 hours, depending on the quantity of ground. For example, I use 400mL/14oz and 40g/1.5oz of ground on an 8 hour drip. The beans should be quite finely ground, as cold water does not penetrate the ground as well as hot water. @henryJ exposed plunging in detail. As for dripping, it is possible to use a standard filter stand and paper filter. The hard part is to drip water slowly. There are cheap devices on the market. An alternative is to get one of those flasks used in chemistry class (a new one, never try with a used one---chemistry is scary). The cheapest way is probably to get an empty plastic bottle, put the cap on, use a needle to make a tiny hole in the cap, fix the bottle upside down above the ground to start dripping. The goal is for the water to pour drop by drop, at a rate of about 1 drop every couple seconds."
Is it safe to use paper towel as a filter when brewing?,"Coffee filters are subject to food grade standards. They aren't just convenient shapes and stronger than paper towels, they have substantially less toxins i.e. bleach byproducts such dioxins (strong carcinogen). As well many paper towels have various purfumes, inks and other chemicals only GRAS (generally recognized as safe) for external use on your skin. Not as a filter medium for an ingested beverage. And as for white being devoid of dyes and chemicals.. natural wood pulp which is what filters and paper towels are made of is a murky brownish grey colour at it's lightest. If it's white it's been bleached. And in most cases with a more potent bleaching agent if the intended use is for paper towels than filter media. Sure you can use paper towels. Most brands won't burst suddenly and it won't kill you on the spot anymore than BPA in older water bottles or lead in drinking water. But is this where you want to save a few pennies - by using something that is going to bring unnecessary amounts of known carcinogens into your diet? I'll stick to coffee filters myself. And unbleached (brown) ones at that."
What is coffee bloom,"The gases themselves are largely composed of CO2 and moisture trapped in the grinds. My understanding is that releasing the gases ahead of time prevent the gasses from interfering with an even extraction throughout the brewing process. As when brewing coffee, we're trying to expose the grounds evenly to the hot water, the release of gas fights against this, causing channeling or uneven extraction. This can affect your flavor profile by overextracting some of the coffee, and not extracting enough from the rest. From my own experience, fresher, better-quality coffees tend to produce more gasses. I would imagine this being because the gasses escape on their own over time from the coffee when it's just sitting around."
Does storing coffee in a freezer preserve freshness?,"No. In fact it's likely to make your coffee taste bad, and gum up your grinder. You should store your coffee in an air-tight container, at or just below room temp (about 25 degrees Celsius).  Coffee can and will absorb all kinds of odors, and while your freezer probably doesn't smell like much, there are odors that will (at the minimum) dull the taste of the coffee. Additionally, when you take your coffee out to room temp, condensation kicks in which further degrades the beans and messes up your grind. Depending on your climate, the condensation can also invite mold. Yuck! The only time you should be freezing or refrigerating coffee is when you're doing so because you've created a desert with some :) Otherwise, dark air-tight containers are the best way to go, just store them in your cabinet. A good rule of thumb: Store anything you buy the way it was when you bought it, unless the label tells you to do something different once you open it."
What does a coffee cherry taste like?,"Lots of questions! Starting from the top... Taste? Coffee cherries are mild in flavour and slightly sweet. The flavour is somewhat reminiscent of other red fruits, like a mild mix of fruits like raspberry, red mulberry, currant, cranberry, cherry, raisin. I've only had them dried, so they have a little bit of a ""dried fruit"" taste (e.g., as raisins are to grapes). To me, they also have a little bit of a mild taste of tobacco leaf. When steeped in water to make a drink called cascara (see this question/answers). The beverage tastes to me a bit like rooibos (red bush tisane). Some coffee shops sell the beverage. Shipping? I've only seen dried coffee cherries for sale. Perhaps ""fresh"" coffee fruits are available in the coffee belt, but the seeds (i.e., coffee beans) are so valuable that I think the whole fruit doesn't make it very far outside of production regions. Availability? Various specialty retailers sell the dried fruit pulp and skins (some call them the ""husks"") -- here's one example from Verve. Searching for coffee berries, cherries, husks, or for beverages like cascara or qishr may reveal more outlets. Other preservation? Coffee skins/pulp dry well. Rehydrating is possible but underwhelming. I have tried to make a kind of marmalade out of them; see this seminal question, and also a follow-up question of mine at Seasoned Advice. I'm sorry to report that I have not had much success yet. The dried cherries are tough, so not pleasant to eat outright. Good ideas! I really like the stuff, and am always happy to find others, and would be happy to hear more ideas about how to eat and drink coffee cherries. EDIT: For completeness, here's a picture of dried coffee cherry pulp/skins that I use to make cascara.

Why would anyone want to hand grind their coffee?,"Hand grinders will work without electricity.   You can generally get a conical hand grinder cheaper than you can get an electric one.   They also create less noise than a electric grinder. Hand grinders will generally produce less heat than an electric (may affect bean flavor). Many grinders are lighter and smaller than electric ones. They are portable and can easily be packed for use when traveling. As to the consistency, a conical grinder (electric or manual) will generally create a more consistent grind than a electric blade ""grinder"".  Electric blade grinders tend to produce dust and boulders.  I know because I use one at work daily and I can see the inconsistency in the grind, but it doesn't bother me that much.  At home, my burr grinder creates a much more consistent grind."
How important is tamping coffee for an espresso machine,"Tamping is one of three key controls you have over the espresso brewing process; The others are dose (the amount of coffee used) and grind coarseness.  Together, they allow the coffee machine operator to produce a puck of the correct density and consistency through which the pressurized water can be pushed through. While techniques vary, the ""rule of thumb"" is to apply roughly thirty pounds of force evenly across the puck; however, the key is consistency.  Keep your variables the consistent and you'll be able to dial in the best end-product. I've been able to pull great shots using anything from just the weight of the tamper itself to my full weight pushed onto a puck, keeping all of the other factors where they needed to be to create the correct puck density. See this video below for more detail: What is the Right Way to Tamp?"
How is instant coffee made?,The result from this is what you get in the store.
Why do the coffee shops give sparkling water along with the Espresso?,"Most people drink espresso not just because it is hot, strong and contains caffeine, but because it is very rich and flavorful. The water is intended to cleanse your palate before the first sip so that you can better enjoy the taste of the espresso."
What is the next best milk substitute for a latte?,"Here's another take, but going in the direction more of performance for foam (i.e., more for cappuccino than latte), mostly because I found links about that :) and because steamed milk should foam. If you're not looking for much foam, the differences are probably less profound. There's a few other plant-based milks out there also; coconut and rice weren't mentioned in the other answers. In sum, I know of 5 common plant milks: almond, coconut, hemp, rice, soy. But there are probably others as well.  Here's some comparisons, summarized from the linked articles: The conclusions tend to be suggest that cow milk will perform better than plant-based ""milks."" This probably suggests that lactose-free milks (i.e., with lactase, like Lactaid and others) will be your best bet. Of course, you could always take a lactase pill and enjoy your cup with conventional milk. Various articles suggest that certain soy milks are best, and that coconut, hemp, and almond will also work. There's a ton of other factors, but these probably reduce to preference: some milks will be sweetened, or import their own taste (e.g., almond, coconut). Others might have emulsifiers or other additives (such as carrageenan), which impact the steaming (maybe helping or hurting). Another take would be to look at the ""science"" of what happens during steaming: it's a combination of fats and proteins that are being agitated and changed in the right way to make foam.  This CoffeeGeek article discusses frothing and what's at work; this was interesting for me, and might help you pick a milk based on protein and fat content among the various milk options."
How can I go about developing my ability to taste flavors in coffee?,"There are several approaches that can aid in developing your palate. The preferred method of tasting coffee. This requires only a cupping bowl and spoon. Dose out coffee, pour in the hot water evenly, and at 4 minutes skim off the top to remove the crust while carefully not disturbing what has settled at the bottom. Wait about 12-14 minutes for the coffee to cool to a desirable drinking temperature, and slurp the coffee with the spoon. There's a variety of descriptions you can use to describe the coffee. Try describe everything. The mouth feel: is it full bodied or light? The acidity: Is it citric or stone fruit? The Smell: What are the aromatics? Every time you taste coffee, keep notes of what flavors you taste. Basic notes of chocolate or smoke are fine, more nuanced flavors like cherry or plum may come out. Don't be afraid to write exactly what comes to mind. If the coffee tastes like captain crunch then write it! Don't just taste your coffee by itself. Compare it to other roasts you've done. Compare it to coffees from other cafes as well. Note the differences."
Latte: Milk before or after coffee?,"Oh, the famous latte! Apparently hardly anyone knows that it simply means ""milk"" in Italian, so technically calling a coffee drink ""latte"" is pure nonsense.   So where does the coffee shop staple get his name from? In Italy, a latte macchiato (""stained milk"") is basically an espresso in a glass of hot (steamed) milk, pouring the espresso last leads to the distinct layers. A caffellatte (""coffee with milk"") is an espresso or coffee from a moka, topped with a generous dose of hot milk. No layers in this cup or glass. So depending on whether your coffee shop makes caffellatte or latte macchiato, you get milk first or coffee first, layers or none."
"What gives ""diner"" coffee its distinctive taste?","I think it is a combination of old stale grounds sitting on a burner for long hours. The places you mention are generally open 24/7 or something close to it and have people ordering coffee at all times of day, so it's all made ahead of time and kept warm all day. The cheapest coffee suppliers usually mix beans from all over the place and they all store them way past any freshness date. Diners run on small budgets and generally buy the cheapest stuff, thus they all have the same ""flavor"". That combination is not just a diner thing, I would also say it is the same as cheap gas station coffee in the US. I would knock it more if it didn't keep me awake behind the wheel more than a few times."
End result of Americano vs Long Black?,"The crema definitely affects the initial taste of the coffee, that's where the concentrated notes of whatever bean you're using is going to be found.  I make a long black by: In contrast, I make an Americano by just pulling a double shot into a cup while also taking care to minimize splashing, then I serve it with a small steel or ceramic carafe of hot water (everyone likes a little more or a little less than everyone else). In both instances, I heat the cup, and that's important because the crema will quickly break up on the walls of the cup if you don't. Most good espresso machines allow you to heat cups on the top of them.  Now, my testing is somewhat limited because I drink good quality Arabica beans pretty much exclusively. Arabica has some subtle flavors and it's easy to tell when they're more pronounced. Long blacks do hit the caramel notes more, in my experience. But, I usually just make myself an Americano because it's easier and the taste isn't all that different.  Done at home using a Breville Barista Express in manual mode. You don't really need a super expensive machine to replicate this, you just need the ability to pre-infuse, warm the cup, and be able to wrangle one under the group to minimize splashing.  Concluding, I think there's some substance to this. However, I'm not sure how much it really matters to someone kind of fumbling around to get their first cup of the day. It took close to a dozen tries to finally get a process down where the taste was noticeable and I could reliably reproduce it.  If you order either at your average coffee shop, I don't know that you'd be able to tell the difference, I never have. "
How do I get started in roasting my own beans at home?,"There are several ways to roast your own coffee at home on low budget: This is one of the extremely minimalistic ways to roast coffee, but the degree of complexity is very high as the coffee beans need constant attention due to the nature of the heat that arrises only from one side. This is likely one of the most common ways to roast coffee at home and a significant step up from the pan, hence the heat is more homogenous. You are still required to mix the coffee now and then hence the plate usually becomes hotter than the upper part of the coffee beans while in the oven. This is likely the best method to use at home, but also very messy as the chaff is likely to twirl around while the coffee is being roasted. A method for catching the chaff could be a simple filter that can tolerate heat or a oversized strainer."
What is the difference between Robusta and Arabica?," All of these factors help bring up the supply and lower the input costs for farmers to produce. With this more attractive price point, a lot of roasters back in the day would add Robusta to their blend in an attempt to reduce their costs and increase their profits. When coffee was initially sold in the 1900s the quality of coffee slowly and slowly deteriorated in an effort for companies to squeeze the most profit. Where youâll find it: Nowadays, itâs not often youâll find Robusta in a coffee blends or in coffee shop. If youâre drinking instant coffee? Well, thatâs probably all Robustaâ¦ but you probably donât care very much about taste. In your espresso blend? Thatâs a mixed bag. Literally. Oddly enough, Robusta is still widely used as part of espresso blends â specifically Italian style blends. It is said to help improve the crema.
One thing to note is despite the association with Arabica of being higher quality, and Robusta as being lower quality, itâs not always the case. Top notch specialty Robusta coffee will usually taste as good as or better than low end Arabica. However, high end Robusta isnât widely used or available. Rather, Robusta is usually used as a filler or cost reducer. Sourced from The Roasters Pack."
Should I thoroughly clean the portafilter basket between shots?,"There's a trade-off here. If you're working in a fast-paced coffee shop, you're likely to favour the faster option (knock out the coffee) over cleaning. Generally knocking out the coffee will get rid of >99% of the grounds from the previous pull, so the impact on the flavour of the next one will be so slight as to be unnoticeable. Usually the portafilter won't even have time to dry out, so the coffee won't dry on and clog up the portafilter. If you're making multiple coffees one after another, reusing the portafilter is probably acceptable. However if you're leaving the coffee machine alone, it's best to at least rinse out the portafilter before you (or the next person) comes to use it. Once the grounds/coffee start to dry, it'll clog up and be much harder to clean further down the line."
What are the reasons to roast coffee yourself?,"You have already listed most of the main points and hit them correctly, but I'll add some additional. Pros:
You can get things not available commercially, and generally a much wider variety of coffee.  For instance, almost all Sumatran coffee is traditionally dark roasted by companies.  However, light roasted Sumatran coffee has a truly unique set of flavors that is fairly distinct from anything else, without light roasting some yourself, you'd be hard pressed (or French pressed if you are into that) to ever find it fresh.  Tastes are remarkably individual and it's highly likely that you like may really like some random type of coffee that either isn't a big seller and available, or isn't traditionally roasted how you prefer.  Cons:
Time.  Roasting takes some amount of your time.  It takes far more when you start (I can now roast a pound of coffee in roughly 5 minutes of my time, because the machine does most of the work and I have a system).  Depending on your equipment and learning curve, this can vary widely.  With the equipment I started with and my initial knowledge, a pound of coffee would have taken me a full hour to roast.   Snobbery.  You will likely get to the point were most other coffee that's commercially produced will be unthinkable to you.  I can't drink coffee at any restaurant without cream (I normally drink it black).  I have a few friends who roast and their coffee is the exception.  But, more or less, home roasting may ruin ""other"" coffee for you.  Along these lines, you may get to the point where you don't enjoy roasting as much anymore, you just want the coffee.  If your time curve is fine, then it works out.  If it's not you might be left with the terrible choice between doing something you don't love or buying less good coffee."
Does coffee cause dehydration?,"Though caffeine's action as a diuretic is hotly debated, recently it seems the scientific consensus is that caffeine in normal doses is a weak diuretic in caffeine-naive individuals only (those without a tolerance), and only in doses exceeding 250-300 mg, or 2-3 cups of coffee. To go even further, A profound tolerance to the diuretic and other effects of caffeine
  develops, however, and the actions are much diminished in individuals
  who regularly consume tea or coffee. And from the same review of the literature:  Doses of caffeine equivalent to the amount normally found in standard
  servings of tea, coffee and carbonated soft drinks appear to have no
  diuretic action. The New York Times exposed this myth in this article: Researchers found no significant differences in levels of excreted
  electrolytes or urine volume [between those given caffeine and a placebo]. Here is another good resource for answering these questions in a clear, FAQ-style and features a good list of references on the topic."
Do I need to use a tamp if using a Moka pot stove top espresso maker?,"You should not tamp the coffee in a Moka. These pots don't like excessive pressure, which tamping would produce due to increased density. This is also why the water should not cover the steam valve. In the worst case they can literally explode!"
Coffee cup patina; is there any logic in not washing the cup,"The origin of not washing your coffee cup stems from the age when coffee cups were made of metal.  An example can be still be seen with the Italian practice of seasoning a moka pot.  When a metal coffee container (moka pot or coffee cup) is new/washed, the coffee takes on a metallic flavor.  Once the container has been used once or twice, the oils from the coffee seal the internal surface preventing the metallic flavor from tainting the brew.  (Many Italians believe that a new moka pot is not usable until several pots of coffee have been brewed and dumped out first) It is easy to imagine the evolution from practical process to tradition by thinking of the time of transition from metal to ceramic coffee mugs.  The young service members who had not used metal coffee cups would be used to washing them, while the old senior leadership would still be in the habit of not washing them and probably had developed a taste for it (hence swearing that it tastes better when the mug is ""seasoned"")."
How long should I steep in French press before decanting?,"I follow the steps in the Stumptown Roasters guide, which actually features a Bodum French Press. The answer is 4 minutes, but it includes a mixing step after the 1 minute mark. From the site: ""...pour hot water (30 seconds off the boil or about 205 degrees F) into the French press, saturating all of your grounds, and pouring to the halfway mark. Start your timer for 4 minutes. After 1 minute, stir the âbloomâ (or top layer) and pour the rest of the water evenly to the top and affix the press pot lid. After the 4 minute timer goes off, plunge and serve."
Advantages and disadvantages of French press,"It depends on the press. I personally use a double-walled (which means air-insulated) press with very very fine screens in the plunger. This means my coffee stays hot for quite some time, and I don't commonly have issues with grounds at the bottom of the second cup (it's a 2-cup press).  I also spent over $300 for it, hand made in Japan by expert crafters with some beautiful stainless steel hardware framing it. It's actually guaranteed to resonate at a certain frequency if you wet your finger and run it around the rim. I digress.  Most presses can have some or all of the following issues: The actual mechanics of making the coffee is very simple. Mix the grinds and water, then using a screen, separate the grinds from the water. The taste is going to depend more on how clean the press is, the quality and temperature of the water, the quality of the bean, grind, how long you let it brew, etc. The same holds true for pour-over brews, provided that the filter is decent and doesn't add its own taste. I personally prefer my press, but it's really a matter of preference. I don't mind cleaning it, in fact one of the reasons I went with a press a while back was in hopes that the prospect of needing to clean it would slow down my consumption. Didn't work.  I love the consistently-good brews I get out of mine, and I love that it keeps my second cup hot long enough for me to enjoy the first. Some people do mind the quirks, and prefer not to use them. Something decent usually starts at around $40, so they're not prohibitively expensive for experimentation. All I can say is try both and see what you think."
Coffee Bean Vs Espresso Bean,"First of all, there is no difference in the beans themselves. They all come from either Robusta or Arabica plants. The roast doesn't vary either. You can use any kind of roast for your espresso, it's up to preference. What does change is the grind. Espresso grind is very fine - much finer than other preparations of coffee. You may find packaged coffee sold as 'espresso beans' or 'espresso roast' being darker/bolder roasts, to emulate a darker, stronger coffee regardless of preparation, however it has little to do with real espresso (and you may even find 'espresso' ground coffees being sold with a large/inconsistent grind!)."
What's the recommended coffee to water ratio for cold brew?,"First, make sure to study What do I need to start cold-brewing. But since concentrate is not discussed there, I don't think your question is a duplicate. Your French press concentrate could last a couple days, depending on the consumption. Assuming you divide the volume of the French press by 5, you would need 1 part of ground coffee (the usual coarse grind you use in the press; extraction is weaker at low temperatures but the time makes up for it even with coarse grind) and 4 parts of fresh room-temperature water, which you gently mix and stir. The coffee should sit for about 12-16 hours at room temperature. Then plunge, and here is the concentrate. To dilute, use another 8 parts of cold water or milk (or better, start with 5-6 parts and taste to determine whether you want it still thinner). Here's my favourite article that discusses dripping methods as well."
How is decaffeinated coffee made?,"Decaffeination (decaf) is the removal of caffeine from coffee beans, cocoa,  and other caffeine-containing materials. While soft drinks which do not use caffeine as an ingredient are sometimes described as ""decaffeinated"", they are better termed ""uncaffeinated"" because decaffeinated implies that there was caffeine present at one point in time. Decaffeinated drinks contain typically 1â2% of the original caffeine content or sometimes as much as 20%. In the case of coffee, various methods can be used. The process is usually performed on unroasted (green) beans, and starts with steaming of the beans. They are then rinsed with a solvent that extracts the caffeine while leaving other constituents largely unaffected. The process is repeated from 8 to 12 times until the caffeine content meets the required standard (97% of caffeine removed according to the international standard, or 99.9% caffeine-free by mass as per the EU standard). Coffee contains over 400 components important to the taste and aroma of the drink, so it is difficult to remove the caffeine without affecting other components. Want to know even more? Well, then, let's talk about the two most common types of decaffeination: The use of water as the solvent to decaffeinate coffee was originally pioneered in Switzerland in 1933 and developed as a commercially viable method of decaffeination by Coffex S.A. in 1980. This method is different in that it does not directly or indirectly add chemicals to extract the caffeine. Rather, it relies entirely on two concepts - solubility and osmosis - to decaffeinate coffee beans. The process begins by immersing a batch of green coffee beans in very hot water in order to dissolve and extract the caffeine. The water is then drawn off and passed through an activated charcoal filter. The porosity of this filter is sized to only capture larger caffeine molecules, while allowing smaller oil and flavor molecules to pass through it. However, this extraction process will also extract desirable oils and other solids from the beans, resulting in beans with no caffeine and no flavor in one tank, and caffeine-free but with flavor water in another tank. The Swiss Water process method attempts to overcome this difficulty by first discarding the flavorless caffeine-free beans, and then reusing the flavor rich water to remove the caffeine from a fresh batch of coffee beans. Water saturated in this way is referred to as green coffee extract or GCE. It is created using a separate batch of green coffee beans, which are immersed in water and then discarded. In a pre-loading tank water, cane sugar and formic acid are mixed and heated and used to preload carbon filter columns. The GCE is then filtered over the columns to extract caffeine from it. A fresh batch of green coffee beans is then immersed in the GCE to remove caffeine but retain other components. The other components can be retained because the water is already saturated with flavor ingredients, therefore, the flavors in this fresh bath cannot dissolve - only caffeine moves from the coffee beans to the water. This results in decaffeination without a massive loss of flavor. The process of filtering the GCE to remove caffeine and immersing the beans is repeated until the beans are 99.9% caffeine free by mass, meeting the required standard. This process takes 8 to 10 hours. it is technically known as supercritical fluid extraction. This method is the most recent method developed by Kurt Zosel, a scientist of the Max Plank Institute, and uses liquid CO2 in place of chemical solvents. The supercritical CO2 acts selectively on the caffeine, releasing the alkaloid and nothing else. Water soaked coffee beans are placed in an extraction vessel. The extractor is then sealed and liquid CO2 is forced into the coffee at pressures of 1,000 pounds per square inch to extract the caffeine. The CO2 acts as the solvent to dissolve and draw the caffeine from the coffee beans, leaving the larger-molecule flavor components behind. The caffeine laden CO2 is then transferred to another container called the absorption chamber where the pressure is released and the CO2 returns to its gaseous state and evaporates, leaving the caffeine behind. The caffeine is removed from the CO2 using charcoal filters and the caffeine free CO2 is pumped back into a pressurized container for reuse on another batch of beans. This process has the advantage that it avoids the use of potentially harmful substances. Because of its cost, this process is primarily used to decaffeinate large quantities of commercial-grade, less-exotic coffee found in grocery stores. There are like 3 more common processes but I believe 2 is enough, even for coffee enthusiasts like us. Sourced from https://en.wikipedia.org"
Is reheating coffee in the microwave a bad idea?,"Although coffee generally becomes staler with time, heating coffee up in the microwave does not produce any harmful chemicals - as long as the container you are microwaving it in is microwave-safe. The microwaves emitted inside the microwave are a relatively safe form of radiation that cause the water molecules in the coffee to move faster, thus creating heat. This is relatively harmless. As far as taste goes, you may consider just making a new coffee, as this will always taste better, in my opinion!"
Freezing brewed coffee,"This is a perfectly good idea, if you freeze the coffee as cubes and plan to use them to chill your iced coffee without watering it down. If you plan to simply freeze the coffee for drinking later I can imagine it being a bad idea, because you will lose some of the flavor. If you even poured milk or cream into the coffee you're planning to freeze, I would even recommend less freezing it, because no kind of milk products can be safely frozen and those are always better used fresh."
Difference between Turkish and Greek coffee?,"...also called Arabic, Cypriot, Bosnian, and what not -- it is the same method. In Greece, it's become Greek coffee (along with the former ""Turkish"" Greek delight) after conflicting with Turkey and the 1974 invasion of Cyprus. The method itself (boiling finely ground coffee in copper cezve, typically sweetened, and served in a demitasse) is said to stem from 15th century Yemen, reaching Constantinople in 17th century and consequently spreading across Ottoman Empire. Apparently, there are interesting variations to it. For instance, Syrian coffee (and probably some others) is flavoured by cardamom."
What's the difference between a percolator and a moka pot?,"A moka pot is what some call a stovetop espresso maker; I find this to be a bit of a misnomer, because the result is rather different than proper espresso. Water is put into a bottom vessel; coffee grounds are placed on a perforated platform with attached cone, which is placed on/in the water vessel; a top holding tank with rubber gasket is screwed on top of the apparatus. The device is placed over a heat source, boiling the water;  the boiling water creates steam and pressure, which forces water through the grounds into the upper storage vessel.  The two chambers are separate, so the water is forced through the grounds once (upward). Somewhat similar to espresso, a moka pot develops some small amount of pressure to force (nearly boiling) water through grounds, though the pressure is much less than espresso (see also this answer). I don't think the grounds are meant to be tamped like espresso, either. A percolator boils water and drips it over grounds continuously.  There is no separate storage vessel for the coffee once brewed; water (at first) or (partially-brewed) coffee is continuously boiled (passing up to the top of the chamber through a funnel/straw) and dripped over the grounds (which are instead at the top of the chamber, rather than in the middle as in the moka pot).  The brewed coffee ends up in the same place the plain water was at the beginning of the brew. Percolators often have a clever little clear cap in the middle of the top, so you can see when the brewing is occurring, and color of the brewed coffee. I have both devices, and use them differently; e.g., a coarser grind for percolator.  I find the outcome of percolated coffee to be more like French press or perhaps drip; moka is more like Turkish coffee or espresso. Though similar in concept (stovetop coffee production devices), they're (to me) totally different in outcome. I suspect, but I don't know, if there are regional differences in these terms. Full disclosure: this meta question and my answer prompted this adaptation as a clarification question."
Why does water remain in the bottom chamber after brewing with a moka pot?,"This is deliberate. In a moka pot, the downward spout of the funnel does not reach all the way to the bottom of the pot. Brewing will stop once the level of water in the pot falls below the bottom of the funnel (if you carry on brewing after this point, you'll be making coffee with the superheated steam, which will be burnt and bitter). I'm not sure why this is how it works, but I guess it's to prevent the pot from boiling dry, and retaining a thermal mass in the bottom pot to help it cool down again.

Why do some people sneer at Starbucks coffee?,"In order to maintain consistency, Starbucks roasts their coffee a tad bit longer than many might prefer. The espresso you get in New York is going to taste exactly like the one you got in Hong Kong, or New Delhi - that's actually kind of impressive. Still, if you're someone that likes their beans just past the second 'crack' - you might find their espresso a bit too dark, a bit too bitter and a bit too expensive to be accepting of a disappointment.  Now, the coffee that they sell in bags gives you plenty of options - you can still get a nice blonde-roasted bag of single source Arabica at many locations. If you're there to order something with milk in it, then you're probably not going to notice just how dark the beans really taste - you'll probably just enjoy your coffee. However, if you tend to take espresso straight, or a drink that is basically espresso cut with water or very little milk, you might thumb your nose in the air a bit. Then again, I'd take a bitter-ish espresso over a cup of bland-ish drip any day. People love to complain if given the opportunity. If you like their espresso, enjoy it - if not, well, drink other espresso :)"
Milk in place of water,"Attempt 1 For the first attempt, I brewed it exactly like I brew my normal (water-based) coffee. I used a French Press with a light/medium roast, heating the milk in Pyrex in a microwave. The milk heated unevenly, curdling in places. Luckily, the curdled bits stuck to the Pyrex and I was able to make a passable cup. The thickness of the milk meant that it didn't want to pass through the mesh when pouring. The predominant flavor was that of the milk. I could barely tell it was coffee, though it definitely absorbed some flavor. The texture was about what you'd expect--very smooth and rich. It was the kind of drink that makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. Attempt 2 From my first attempt, I learned that milk is able to absorb and mask coffee's flavor incredibly well (after all, it's what people use to tone down overly strong coffee). This time, I heated the milk in a saucepan over low heat, stirring frequently (a rather long and annoying process for a single cup of coffee). I probably could have gotten it a bit hotter, but it worked well enough. I nearly doubled the amount of grounds and brew time. This time, it came out with a distinct coffee smell, and about the same texture. Again, the initial flavor was that of the milk, but it had a smooth, subtle, and quite pleasant coffee aftertaste. I never got that bad taste you sometimes get a while after a normal cup of coffee--instead, the residual flavor was like you had just taken a sip. Conclusions I wouldn't want milk-brewed coffee for my morning cup. It feels more like a drinkable dessert. If anyone else wants to try this, I recommend using some stronger/darker coffee. I didn't have any dark roast on hand, or I would have tried it. Give it time to brew--more than you would with water. Be patient when heating the milk, or you'll end up curdling it and ruining the whole thing. This could probably work as a dessert drink if brewed with some spices in addition to the coffee. If nothing else, I'd say it looks pretty cool as you can see in the attached image. UPDATE I tried this again today with espresso coffee (Cafe Bustelo), and it turned out great. The end result was like a latte but more... dull, or smooth. I don't know how exactly to compare it. Espresso grind is definitely the right choice when brewing with milk--it's the only thing strong enough and with the right flavor profile to stand out in the milk and complement the milk's flavor. Be warned, though, that the fine grind of espresso coffee means you will need to use a paper filter at some point along the way. Sticking a paper filter in a French Press doesn't work because of how resistant the milk is to going through the filter. It seems to jet around the sides, allowing the espresso to slip through. "
How long can I store roasted coffee beans?,"I assume you are storing them for a later grinding (likely just before preparing your cups of coffee). According to some sources 1,2,3, the main point is use it within a week. For more than that, it is preferable to freeze them, and in this condition, for no more than a month. A brief summary: For short term use (this week's coffee): For long term use (no more than a month): 1: ""How to store coffee. National Coffee Association""

Home Roasting with Fresh Roast SR500,"There is a goodish guide for your roaster here. I'd also keep in mind that coffee has a cooling period after you ""stop"" roasting, where it will generally still roast to a darker level (or two). You need to try to finish your roast at a level or so lighter than what you are aiming for and let the coffee ""cool"" into your desired roast. I might suggest that you roast at a lower level (lower heat) so that the beans move through the stages more slowly.  This will badly suck up your time, but will also allow you greater chance of stopping the roast at the roast level you are aiming for. Keep in mind that many of the descriptions you read for green coffee are done by people with extremely refined palates.  No matter what coffee you roast, those fruit type descriptions are still hints and notes in the coffee, not it's overall flavor.  Additionally the quality of the green beans you are roasting will affect the final quality of your roast. It's impossible to make poor green beans great by perfectly roasting them.  You can, however, ruin high quality green beans with a poor roast.   When I started roasting, I was ""lucky"" enough to start with a cheap air popper.  The advantage of that is that with a popper it is very easy to hear the ""cracks"" associated with roasting.  My personal opinion is that the ""cracks"" are one of the few constants with beans that actually consistently indicate roast level. While there are other gauges out there (darkness and smell), they can vary with different varieties of beans.  Eventually I moved to a machine where I couldn't hear the cracking at all, but by then, I had learned enough of the other cues that it didn't matter as much."
How can I stay off coffee after I quit?,"I kicked it by switching to caffeine pills so that I could carefully taper down. Before I started the process, though, I went to caffeineinformer to get a good estimate of my daily habit. I then used caffeine pills to replace the milligrams of caffeine I was having as coffee. From there, I began to cut the pills into quarters and slowly reduce my intake over the course of several months. Each Saturday I would step down by one quarter of a pill. Withdrawal was minimal and by Monday I was back able to work. It took discipline and patience. One unintended, but huge benefit that I found by going this route is that I disassociated the buzz with the ritual and smell of coffee. It became clinical for me. Plus it was quite easy to control when I took my caffeine. I no longer had to make or find coffee to get my fix."
What does Kopi Luwak taste like?,"I've had this on the farm where it was harvested, and was able to verify for myself that wild, happy civets were left to their own selection process and merely followed around by farmers eager to find the drops. It's not unlike any other Arabica bean. What I had was single-source, but that's rarer - farms doing it correctly don't produce a lot, so packagers and marketers will usually buy from dozens. That brings me to the first thing that determines the taste of it: Some farmers roast themselves, others just sell the beans. Many sell directly to people and to packagers, so unless you get it single-source, you're probably going to have a bag of beans roasted anywhere from blonde to nearly dark. If you're serious about tasting it, find a place that offers single-source, or roasts their own. You want it just at the second 'crack'. A comparable color is a Starbucks 'blonde' roast, or the usual color of illy in the red can. I've had it two ways, as espresso and in a press. I prefer to have it in a press, despite not getting nearly as much crema. A coarse grind, hot clean water and about 4 minutes to brew. Drink it immediately with a clean palette. Make sure you're not thirsty, make sure you're not hungry, and make sure there's nothing going on with your taste buds other than the coffee. You want to sip slow and enjoy it. Don't let it get cold, but slow down. While debates are quite hot regarding whether or not the civet's digestion of the bean adds anything to flavor, I'm quite confident that the selection process does. Good Arabica coffee is known for the subtle nutty / caramel hints, and you know it when you drink this. I couldn't detect any difference in acidity, but the flavors that the bean is known are definitely more present than usual. This makes a lot of sense given the selection process, civets are very picky cats. But, that's not to say that a very discriminating and trained picker couldn't get you something close. In fact, illy (red) comes very close to the same quality and presence of flavor undertones that I've experienced with alamid (kopi luwak). Don't raise your expectations too high, it's not really that much better than any other very high quality Arabica. You're paying for the process (make sure you're dealing with an 'honest' source) as much as you are the quality of bean, novelty and experience. It tastes very good, but so do the illy beans I grind every day."
What differentiates a $100 coffee machine from a $1000 coffee machine?,"More expensive coffee machines typically have better ""plumbing"", including some and even all of the following: Now this doesn't mean you can't get good coffee on a cheaper machine. You're just going to have to put more effort in it and get more variable results. Which is more than fair for most people. As for the price difference, most of these features will raise the price by themselves and a lot of the more expensive machines are hand-made as well. Last point they are also very pretty and a status symbol, not to the extent of let's say a very expensive watch but it does sort of feel that way sometimes."
What type of roast has the lowest caffeine content?,"In general, darker, arabica roasts have less caffeine. Arabica (as opposed to robusta) inherently has less caffeine in it naturally, and darker coffees have less caffeine since they have been roasted longer or at higher temperatures, essentially ""burning"" the caffeine out of the bean.
 EDIT For some science, Arabica is usually found to be about 1.2% caffeine and Robusta is typically 2.2% caffeine Source: Differences between Arabica and Robusta Coffee Chris in AK has a great explanation in the comments as to why darker roasts are perceived to have less caffeine It is a common misconception that darker roasts have less caffeine.  Caffeine's melting point is 455F which is well above what most beans reach during the roasting process.  Essentially, caffeine content changes because the mass/density of the beans change (they lose water and undergo changes in the roasting process).   If you measure your coffee by volume, dense greener beans will have more caffeine.  If you measure by weight, darker roasted beans will have more caffeine."
"Why are lattes often served in big, wide cups?","It may be just me, but I think it has to do with aiming for a ratio of foam to liquid in each sip. Basically a taller cylindrical cup with the same amount of foam on it would cause the first couple of sips to be mostly, if not entirely, foam. With a shorter wider cup you can have a lot of foam, but in a thinner layer, allowing for a more balanced sip and better mouth feel through the duration of the cup."
Does it make a difference whether the moka lid is open or not?,"So what I've been taught is that you should keep the lid open while brewing. This is so you can watch the progress of the extraction, and cut the heat at the appropriate time. It gives you much more control over your brew this way - for example, I cut the heat (and run the base under the cold tap for larger pots) as soon as I see the coffee running from the spout turn lighter, rather than waiting for the gurgle. However, as for lid open/closed during brewing, I don't imagine this has any effect on the extraction. The amount of heat lost will be tiny in comparison to other variables."
How much caffeine is in an espresso shot?,"According to caffeineinformer, there is 77 mg of caffeine in 1Â½ shots of espresso. Comparatively, an 8 oz. cup of brewed coffee comes in at 163 mg of caffeine. There is roughly 1/2 as much caffeine in 1.5 shots as there is in 8 oz. of brewed coffee."

Why do we need to fold the border of filters?,"I did a little bit of research at the site of inventor of the coffee filter. It's Melitta from Germany. In the german FAQ I found the following: Warum falte ich Filterpapier vor dem Einlegen um? Damit die Kaffeezubereitung optimal funktioniert, muss das
Filterpapier genau in die Form des Filters gebracht werden. Dies
geschieht, indem Sie die beiden geprÃ¤gten RÃ¤nder umfalten. Das

In order for the coffee preparation to work optimally, the filter paper must be brought exactly into the shape of the filter. This is done by folding over the two embossed edges. This causes the filter paper to nestle against the edge of the filter and sit deep in the filter insert. This good fit prevents the filter paper from folding in during the brewing process Additional fact: The coffee filter was not invented by Melitta the company, but by Melitta Bentz. Sorry for that bad translation. My English is really not the best. Please improve me!"
How does the temperature of the water affect the taste of the coffee,"Temperature affects extraction rate, but also varies between compounds in the coffee beans. Coffee grounds contain a hodgepodge of volatile and non-volatile components, such as various oils, acids, and other aromatic molecules [2]. Collectively, these compounds that are found in coffee grounds are referred to as âcoffee solublesâ and significantly contribute to coffee flavor [2]. Brewing is the process of extracting these components from the grounds, so coffee beverages are technically a solution of coffee solubles and water. Given that coffee grounds are used in both of our brewing methods, the principle variables are temperature and time. Temperature affects the solubility and volatility of the coffee solubles. Relative to brewing, solubility describes the ability of the solubles to dissolve out of the grounds and into the water; volatility refers to their ability to evaporate into the air. Coffee solubles dissolve best at an optimal temperature of 195-205Â°F [3]. With more coffee solubles extracted, hot brew coffees are described as more full-bodied and flavorful when compared to cold brew. Moreover, due to increased volatility with higher temperatures, the aromatics are more readily released from coffee, giving rise to that beloved scent of freshly-brewed coffee. On the downside, oxidation and degradation also occur more rapidly at higher temperatures. The oils in coffee solubles can oxidize more quickly at elevated temperatures, causing coffee to taste sour. Acids also degrade, the most notable of which is chlorogenic acid into quinic and caffeic acid, causing coffee to taste bitter [2]. Where cold brew lacks in temperature, it makes up for in time. Coffee solubles have markedly decreased solubility in room temperature water. Increasing the brew time from a few minutes to many hours aims to maximize extraction of the solubles from the grounds. Even over twenty-four hours, not all the coffee solubles will have dissolved; this is why the amount of coffee grounds is doubled, in an effort to make up for the lower extraction rate. In comparison with hot brew, cold brew is sometimes described as tasting âdeadâ or âflatâ due to the lower yield of coffee solubles [3]. Further, decreased volatility prevents aromatics from escaping from coffee as easily, so cold brew is much less perfumed than its hot brew counterpart. Oxidation and degradation will still occur in cold brew methods, but this happens much more slowly; bitterness and acidity are just about absent in cold brew coffee, especially if it is kept cold. Though, cold brew doesnât merely taste like hot brew without the bitterness. Fans of the cold brew method have emphasized that cold brews contain a completely different flavor profile that canât be found with hot brews. Going back to the idea of solubility, not all flavor compounds of coffee solubles are equally soluble. A good majority of the coffee solubles are still able to leach out of the grounds, even in colder water. The compounds that donât dissolve are the ones often attributed to unfavorable flavors [4]: these stay in the grounds that are subsequently tossed away. Consequently, cold brews take on a much sweeter, floral profile. To note, brew time does not determine caffeine content, nor does bitterness indicate coffee strength. Caffeine is extracted early in the brewing process, so extending brew time, by either method, would only result in over-extracted coffee [1]. Coffee âstrengthâ is defined as the amount of dissolved coffee solubles per unit of coffee volume [1]. On that train of thought, cold brew certainly produces stronger coffee, given that the brewing process purposely concentrates the coffee solubles. Though, keep in mind that rarely anyone drinks cold brew coffee straight up; many enjoy this smooth drink diluted with milk or water. - Coffee Brewing Chemistry: Hot Brew vs. Cold Brew."
What coarseness of grind works best for cold brew?,"Two guides do have specific (though differing!) recommendations on coarseness of grind for cold brew.  Personally, I use the latter because I find the filtering goes more easily with a coarser grind; see also this question about making cold brew easier to filter. This question also discusses the grind. See also related questions with the tag cold-brew."
Does the bloom matter in French Press?,"I believe there is mysticism to blooming. Don't get me wrong, I feel its important, but I don't think it does all the things that people claim it does. Blooming is important when using fresh roasted beans(and you should be). Blooming simply aids in removing CO2 from the grounds, which would otherwise create negative space between your grounds and the water. It's simply used to provide a more even extraction. Blooming is important in any immersion brewing, and can even aid in pour-over methods as well. You should also reduce your brew time slightly to compensate for the extraction that takes place during the bloom. I'd typically bloom for 30 seconds, then push the bloom down gently without agitation(agitation effect solubility). I think its a dubious claim to state that the bloom does anything beyond removing the CO2, thus providing a more even extraction. It would really depend on how you perform your bloom. Do you bloom then start your timer? Do you bloom with a small amount of water first, then add more to prevent too much extraction during the bloom? Ultimately these differences in taste don't have anything to do with the bloom itself, but more so the extraction time brought on by how you perform your bloom. The bloom itself does not effect taste, and it is an important part of using a french press, as its key to providing even extraction."
What do producers usually mix ground coffee with to make it cheaper?,"I will not go into any political discussion, theory or similar, but I can give you a few historical facts. There have always been times in the last few centuries when coffee was a rare commodity. And it has always been expensive to some degree, making it ""something for special occasions"" in the poorer parts of European societies. People used and still use various ""substitutes"" from grains (barley, spelt, rice), roots (chiccory, dandelion), fruit (acorns, dates), typically roasted, ground and prepared like coffee beans, resulting in a somewhat bitter, dark drink more or less resembling genuine coffee. (For a more extensive list, see the link above.)  Instead of replacing coffee, they can also be mixed with coffee, ""stretching"" the yield of the coffee beans. If you want to check your coffee for ""fillers"", buy whole beans - none of the coffee substitutes look even remotely like coffee beans."
How does coffee grind size affect coffee taste,"The main reason for different grinds is the different brewing processes. If the water is exposed to the grounds for a very short amount of time (e.g., 10-15 seconds for espresso), you need a finer grind to provide enough surface area to extract the coffee from the beans. If the brewing time is long (e.g., the ~4 minutes of french press), you need a coarse grind to avoid over-extracting the grounds and getting something too bitter to drink. That's really the heart of it. If the grind is too coarse for your brewing method, your coffee will end up under-extracted, weak, and acidic. If it is too fine a grind, your coffee ends up over-extracted and bitter. Your grinder is a good brand; if you still have the manual, it includes a guide to grind vs. brewing method. If not, the capresso.com site includes PDF versions."
When and how should I clean my moka pot?,"If you stop washing your mocha pot completely, you'll see a bit of a residue buildup  on the inside of the pot from many past cuppas imparting their special oils to surface. This ""seasoning"" is said to protect the brew from any off flavors that might be imparted by the bare metal of the pot.  Whether this effect can be quantified by a perceptible difference in taste, I see no reason to part with tradition; it is a badge of honor and the sign of a well-used pot. At the very least, you are saving yourself a lot of trouble in having to clean it out each time. You can certainly clean the outside with an appropriate cleaner if the patina isn't to your liking, but I would just rinse the inside with hot water. Liquid detergents have a way of imparting their own taste, and dishwashers will can quickly oxidize aluminum pots like the Bialetti."
How do I make that frothy milk that coffee shops use to make lattes?,"They aren't just frothing the milk, they're also stretching the milk. Stretching it is what gives a latte its unique texture (though the micro bubbles add to that). If you want a good latte, focus first on stretching it - you can use a small whisk to get air into the milk if need be. You want a small stainless steel pitcher, most look like this:  Put 2/3 of the amount of cold milk you actually want in your latte in that, then put it on a heat source (small burner is okay). Hold your hand around the pitcher while it heats, and use the other hand to stir the milk. You can also use one hand and just swirl the milk around in the pitcher - do what feels comfortable, just keep the milk moving.  As soon as the pitcher becomes just less than too hot for your hand, pull it. Swirl it around a little bit and look inside. Does the milk have a kind of gloss to it similar to Elmer's glue (or any other paste you used in school)? If not, Put it back on the heat for 20 - 30 seconds, swirling it as you do. Once it's got that gloss, and the milk has expanded a bit, it's stretched properly. An electric burner is ideal for this, but there are also metal overlays for gas burners that just provide a hot surface. At that point you can use a hand whisk, or any number of the frothing gadgets that you can find in any cooking store (brick-and-mortar or online).  You can, of course, just froth the milk, but what you're essentially doing is aerating it. That's fine, it's going to make a tasty drink, but it might fall short of your expectations if you don't stretch the milk as well. The process is what makes the milk and the coffee fall in love and give birth to a latte. The steam wand on espresso machines heats the milk and adds the air, giving you a lot more control over the process. However, this will work almost as well.  Tips: Total for this would be about $15 for the stainless steel pitcher, $10 - $15 for the frother, so all total around 30 bucks. You could use a sauce pan, but it's much harder to gauge how hot the milk is if you do, and much harder to control when you pour. "
What is the optimal brewing technique for extracting caffeine?,"I think the answer to your question is generally going to be espresso. Brewing process all comes down to pressure, temperature, extraction time (water contact time), possibly agitation and filtering. I may be missing a variable, but all the methods of brewing are just mixing of those variables. If you fix all but one variable, you'd have an answer for any given equation. All of these things are ultimately affecting the solubility of the caffeine in the coffee.  Since espresso is one of the few brewing methods to affect pressure (and generally uses the greatest pressure) it's going to be the winner.  Increased pressure means increased caffeine solubility. From wikipedia you'll note the two major factors affecting solubility are temperature and pressure.  You'll also note that dissolution doesn't always happen instantly; rates may vary based on conditions.  By increasing pressure during brewing my guess is that the rate of caffeine dissolution is increased.  making it more efficient for short brewing times."
How to create these 3-D latte art?,This video here seems to have a good tutorial: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTZNs2Mjxos The steps seem to be as follow:
How to properly use the Bialetti Brikka,"I understand that the crema created by the Brikka is an approximated crema using the gasket's small opening. Sure, purists may not consider this tan, smooth film of microbubbles as authentic crema (akin to espresso makers), but it does do a good job creating it for a close mouthfeel.  I use my Brikka every day, and it creates the ""Brikkrema"" (as I'd like to call it) just fine [see the photo]. If you aren't achieving proper results, it could be the water, or the bean you're using. I've had instances where some beans wouldn't generate a great crema, as compared to other varieties. Factors could be the age, the containers their kept in, and all basically relating to the oils and the CO2 trapped in the bean shortly after roasting.     The last photo shows a comparison between pours. The first pour (left) often providing the most crema from a brew, while the subsequent pours (right) may not have as much. It helps to spread the first pour over each shot if you have more than one shot to serve, and then pour the rest of the coffee along the side of the cup as not to disturb the cream on top. Sometimes, a brand new Brikka needs 3-4 brews before it begins creating its magic. But even so, if you aren't achieving your preferred result, try these tips:  Good luck! And don't worry, at the end of the day it boils (or brews) down to personal preference."
Coffee in Breaking Bad,"All coffee preparations can be improved with an application of science! Simply by monitoring and carefully controlling conditions such as water temperature, brew-time, grind etc., you can improve the taste of your coffee. No doubt with the array of instruments available to them in Breaking Bad they could have done a fine job of this! As for the aparatus, this Chemistry Stack Exchange answer goes into a lot of detail. It seems a vacuum pump is being used to boil the water at a lower temperature than otherwise. This setup might be a bit beyond what non-chemists are able to construct though! If you want to pretend you're in Breaking Bad while making your cup of coffee without a PhD in Chemistry, the closest you're going to get is with a Chemex flask:  It's basically pour-over drip coffee, albeit with proprietary, thicker filters that change the taste of the coffee (by removing more of the oils)."
What variables in brewing have the biggest effect on taste?,"A few other factors to consider: Freshly ground beans. How you store your coffee beans. You basically want to keep them reasonably cool and away from oxygen, sunlight, moisture and variations in temperature (which is why you don't keep them in the freezer except for long term storage). Generally in the pantry in an opaque, air-tight container. I one-way valve is recommended as recently roasted beans will emit CO2. I bought a stack of 250g resealable foil bags with the one-way valve from a local roaster and would use each bag a few times. These days I use AirScape canisters. The water you use. If you wouldn't enjoy drinking your tap water, don't use it to brew coffee. Use the same water you use for drinking water. The amount of water you put in the Aeropress vs. the amount of water and/or milk you add afterwards (if any). How vigorously you stir with the paddle. Generally you want to stir just enough to ensure all the grounds are thoroughly wetted, and that there are no air pockets. Stirring too much can over-extract which will increase the bitterness. When pressing into the cup, do you only press until you hear the air hissing through, or do you keep going and compress the puck, squeezing out every bit of water you can?[1] The latter can over-extract and increase bitterness. Using paper filters vs. a metal disc filter. Also, some people believe pre-rinsing a paper filter makes a difference. Obviously there are a lot of variables, and people can become amazingly pedantic. Fun if you don't mind a bit of experimentation. With regards to water temperature, the general wisdom is that you want the slurry of coffee and water to brew at around 95Â°C, which is just a bit under boiling for optimal extraction. This video gives some pretty good advice on this. Pre-heating the Aeropress would probably make the biggest difference here[2]. I usually just wait until the water in the kettle stops bubbling before pouring. Apparently it is possible to burn the grounds if you hit them with water that is boiling. The other bugbear I have is with retention in coffee grinders. Retention is when grounds are left up in the works of the grinder, and often the grounds can come out very staticy and cling to everything and make a mess. This grosses me out as it means old grounds from previous grinding will be dropped in with the fresh grind. Weighing the beans before and after can show a variation of half a gram or more. Urk.[3] However I've found that sprinkling a couple of drops of water on the beans before grinding almost completely eliminates retention for me.[4] [1] There's a term for over-squeezing the grounds that escapes me at the moment. [2] Having lived a lot of my life in drought areas, using and then discarding the water to pre-heat my Aeropress or French press is something I find surprisingly hard to do. [3] I did mention people can become amazingly pedantic, didn't I? [4] Known as the Ross Droplet Technique"
How should I store ground coffee?,"In general, it's best to not store ground coffee. If quality really matters, then the real answer is to back up. Try to grind only enough coffee for what you're using immediately to brew with. If you're buying preground coffee, then storage and optimal quality become somewhat trivial. Once the surface area of the coffee is increased (by grinding it), the majority of the coffee is exposed to air, accelerates the decomposition of the coffee, meaning it likely isn't going to stay fresh for long anyway. Think of it like opening a dry, red wine. Since it's been opened, it's going to turn faster than it being left in the bottle because it's been exposed to atmosphere. So in short, if flavor and freshness really matter, try not to store ground coffee if at all possible.   EDIT If you really must store ground coffee, keep it sealed airtight. The exposure to atmosphere is going to be the strongest catalyst in making your coffee less than fresh."
How much does keeping beans vacuum sealed matter?,"Coffee beans are freshest from about 12 to 48 hours after roasting until maybe one or two weeks later when stored properly in an airtight container.  During the early portion of this period (immediately after roasting to three or four days later) beans will be still giving off some gases, thus the reason for one way valves on coffee bags.  That being the case, vaccuum sealing can extend that time some, but not indefinitely.  Storing your coffee in the freezer actually makes the problem worse since the freeze thaw cycle drys the beans out and forces the oils to separate out of the beans."
Generating crema with a moka pot?,"Moka pots (or stove top percolators) usually produce a pressure of around 1.5 bar, while most coffees require a pressure of at least around 6 bar for a crema to appear. However, there are some Moka pots with a special valve (called Cremator) which helps creating more pressures and thus produce a crema. By the way, a real Espresso has to be brewed with a pressure of 9 bar Â± 1, according to the Italian National Espresso Institute, so it can't be brewed with a Moka pot."
Stainless steel moka pot with a crema valve for espresso-like crema,"My wife and I moved to our new house and we have an induction hob installed there. We used our brikka(s) a lot and loved the results. We bought a 4 cup musa for the time being but compared to the brikka it tasted like fermented horse urine. So I decided to experiment:
Apparently the head from our 2 cup brikka fits the bottom of the 4 cup musa.
It worked! The results are fantastic.
I am going to purchase a 6 cups musa and see if it fits our 4 cup brikka. The thread on the musa is a bit longer but it doesn't matter: just screw it hard until it locks to put pressure on the seal. Use just the boiler tank from the musa and all the rest from the brikka as the coffee funnel filter of the musa doesn't have a rubber seal needed for the higher pressure.
Don't put too much water (fill the amount that matches the head. Not the tank) Good luck! "
What constituant in coffee has a laxative effect?,"Disclaimer: I am not a doctor, nor do I play one on TV... I would guess that it is a combination of a few factors. Coffee contains caffeine which is a stimulant and most stimulants have some degree of laxative effect.  If nothing else stimulants will raise your metabolism, so even if it isn't immediate you'll be heading to the bathroom sooner than you would without them.  It also looks like caffeine causes stimulation of the bowels specifically.  coffee can also cause looser stools because increased peristalsis
  leaves less time for the colon to perform one of its key
  functionsâreabsorbing water from fecal matter to produce well-formed
  stools. Be aware, however, that other common accompaniments to coffee
  can be culprits in this matter. Dairy products, excess sugar, even
  âsugarlessâ sweeteners like sorbitol (a well-known substance used as a
  laxative) can cause diarrhea. - Source Coffee is mostly water   The psychological effect  "
What can I do with bad coffee beans?,Cold brew it! Make sure you start with very cold water and a coarse grind. Cold-temp chemistry has a better chance of taking what's good and leaving what's bad. 
Coffee stain in coffee cups,"Baking soda. I use a standard dish sponge/scrubbie with baking soda and a little water and it comes completely out. I've actually tried it with just a damp paper towel and baking soda and it's almost as easy. Baking soda has natural whitening properties and is a very gentle abrasive. I actually started using it elsewhere (sinks, counter tops, greasy pans) before discovering its use in coffee cups. I've also tried baking soda + salt on counter tops and pans with great success. Salt has similar whitening properties (surprisingly to me) and is a stronger abrasive. Haven't tried it in coffee cups, but you might consider trying that if you need a little extra cleaning power. (Also: Aside from being cheap, baking soda / salt are food-grade and non-toxic!) "
Most moka pots don't work on my induction stove. How can I still use them?,"Yes, you just need to get a pot that's made of the right stuff. Induction hobs only work with magnetic metals. If you can stick a magnet to your coffee pot, it will work. Traditional moka pots are made of aluminium, which is why they don't. I have one that looks like this:  A quick search on Amazon should find you what you want, or enquire at your nearest big cookware store - the advisors there should be able to show you which ones will work (most will have indicators on the box in any case)."
"If I'm in a rush, can I simply use raw ground coffee like instant coffee?","It boils down to taste - some people even chew whole beans.  Safety-wise there are no concerns1 and the method you propose is not unheard of, it goes by the term ""Cowboy coffee"" and others. Some preparation methods even quickly boil the grounds and water (Turkish coffee), other sources warn against pouring boiling water over your grounds and suggest letting the water cool a few degrees first. It is up to you to decide whether you like the grainy residue you might taste if you don't let the grounds settle enough before drinking. So, go ahead and do a taste test. You can always pour your coffee through a sieve or use the leftovers for drip coffee.  1 There is some discussion whether the slightly higher content of coffee oils compared to filtered matters healthwise, but that's a very vague subject, IMHO. Other brewing methods bring more oils as well."
"Aeropress metal filters, are they worth it?","I have used both the paper filters and the ""Able"" brand metal AeroPress disk that you linked. They are a bit different, and I use both the metal disk and paper filter based on my mood. To my taste, the metal disk does produce a ""fuller"" bodied cup (because more ""stuff"" comes through the filter -- oils and macro-particles or whatever). I believe that ""an average user"" (by my definition) would be able to tell the difference in a side-by-side test, and probably enough to determine preference. That said, I prefer the paper for a few reasons. First, the simple convenience is better for me. After brewing, I plunge the filter and spent grounds directly into my compost container. After a quick rinse of the unit, it's clean enough for me. As for my (personal) taste and preferences, I think the paper produces a better quality and more enjoyable cup. Since the perforations are larger, there is more grit in the output when using the metal disk, so you end up with a (small amount) of ""sludge"" in the bottom of your cup, and it will turn bitter more quickly because of longer contact with the grounds after brewing. As an aside, I also prefer it for the marginal (and debatable) ""health"" reasons. Paper filters remove some compounds (such as cafestol) that have purported cholesterol-affecting properties. For more of ""my opinion"" on that, see this question about general comparison between paper and re-usable filters and my answer about the topic in general."
Why does coffee taste better out of ceramic cups compared to a paper cup?,"Both cup material and temperature are in play here, I think. A big part of the coffee taste (and experience as a whole) is the aroma. I personally find that paper cups (not surprisingly) smell and taste like paper. Ceramic (or glass, porcelain, etc.) should be practically neutral. Any smell you get from the cup could affect the perception of taste of the contained beverage. If the cup has a plastic lid, that could contribute both to its own smell, or holding-in / reducing the coffee aroma that you smell, also. (Aside: there are some interesting links to the physiology of smell and taste interplay at the Wikipedia article on taste.) The very experience of drinking from a paper cup versus a ceramic cup is different; heft, shape, handle, other aesthetics, etc., though this probably reduces to personal preference.  For example, I find sometimes that my lip sticks to the outside of the paper cup, which is unpleasant (to me, anyway :). A plastic lid could be a factor here as well. Temperature may also be a factor. For example, temperature can affect the perception of bitterness. A properly pre-heated ceramic cup/demitasse will help the brewed coffee be at a consistent temperature (without shocking it after pull) and keep it warmer for longer (so it doesn't cool down too quickly). Such temperature changes could result in a difference in taste; keeping brewed coffee at a consistent temperature is recommended -- that and some other general properties are listed here. Temperature stability of the brew will probably be different between paper and ceramic."
How can I improve this latte?,"I own this machine and have since moved on from it for the exact reasons you stated. It is possible to create microfoam that is good enough for making clearly defined latte art on the Delonghi Dedica but it requires practice (as would doing the same on any machine). You did the right thing by removing the metal sleeve but the main problem is that the steam power is relatively weak and so it makes it harder to create the vortex required to properly incorporate the aerated milk. Focus on trying to create a spinning vortex/whirlpool type effect in your milk as this is the most important step in ensuring you end up with silky milk. For good latte milk, you should not over-aerate. A good starting point is simply raising the height of the milk in your pitcher by about a centimetre. Once again, however, it will require practice and even then it may not be perfect due to the lack of steaming power this machine has. The Delonghi Dedica also uses a pressurised portafilter basket which means that the crema you find in your cup is a result of artificial pressures produced inside the basket (similar to how Nespresso machines make their 'crema'). You can attempt to create darker crema by making the pressurised basket not the limiting factor of extraction by grinding finer (but not so fine as to choke the machine). Temperature-wise, you want to ensure that your portafilter is heated by running empty shots through it as it will cool down the shot as it moves through the portafilter. The steam is also not as hot as commercial machines as they have dedicated boilers for the steaming rather than interchanging between functions within a few seconds like the Delonghi. In conclusion, if you enjoy your coffee the way you make it, stick with the Delonghi Dedica but if you put a lot of value in the quality of the crema and being able to pour latte art then you might want to consider an upgrade or investing more time into practicing milk steaming."
Why do most coffee shops use such dark roast?,"Roasting coffee dark may be used because it is easier to create a consistently flavored bean, with less monitoring and concern for flavor profiles. In the case of Starbucks they are shipping so much of their coffee to so many locations and creating so much coffee at once that it may be easier to create consistency. The darker you roast the less the flavor of the original bean matters, so it may also be used as a method to roast cheaper or lower quality beans."
How should I store my aeropress?,"According to the Aeropress manual: Remove the cap and set it aside.  Push the plunger to eject the ""puck""
  of spent grounds into the trash.  Rinse and/or brush away any grounds
  left on the rubber seal.  The seal has already wiped your chamber
  clean, so no further cleanup is needed. Always eject the puck right after brewing, and store your Aeropress
  with the plunger pushed all the way through or completely removed. 
  Storing the seal uncompressed will keep your seal airtight for years. (source [pdf])"
What are these spots on the inside of my moka pot? Do I need to remove them?,"Short story: They are probably aluminum oxide, but almost certainly some kind of metal oxide. You don't need to take any action unless they're affecting the taste of your coffee, and it shouldn't be. You probably can't (or shouldn't) really permanently remove them even if you wanted to. Longer story... This is a classic Bialetti model, and a classic Bialetti symptom. The vessel is probably made out of alumin[i]um alloy (though there are similar models that are made of stainless steel, your picture seems to be looking down into the bottom heating vessel, and it looks like the classic aluminum species). Unfortunately the symptoms you're seeing, from my perspective, is a classic failure of the Bialetti design. Aluminum tarnishes (oxidizes) somewhat readily, especially when it is hot and in contact with water. Correspondingly, the only way to use this thing is, indeed, to heat it with water. The vessel, especially, needs to be rinsed and dried thoroughly in The Right Way. The ""care"" page for Bialetti (follow that link, then click on the ""Care Use"" tab; I can't figure a direct link) suggests to dry thoroughly and most tellingly ""Do not reassemble the product until all parts are completely dry to avoid oxidation."" Even if you're meticulously drying the thing, it's still going to be a little hot and a little damp; this is going to invite oxidation.  Standard ways of removing tarnish are even more damaging in the long term than just leaving them alone. Aluminum oxide generally protects the metal from further oxidation (unlike rust -- iron oxide -- which flakes off and facilitates further oxidation). I have a stainless steel moka pot, and it's terribly tarnished on the outside from heating on a gas burner hundreds of times, but the inside is clean (and cleanable) as the metaphorical ""whistle"". For completeness: It's also possible that they are mineral deposits; this answer to the other question that you linked has some additional info about that possibility. It would come from a buildup (""scale"") from using ""hard"" water, and more so when nearly boiling dry (also not a good idea); filtered or distilled water is much less likely to do this. However, I think it's unlikely that you'd see scale buildup over the span of a couple dozen uses."
What is Breakfast/Morning blend?,"Breakfast or morning blends are generally a lighter roast, but there is no industry standard for how light of a roast. As for differences between breakfast and morning blends, the key is in the word ""blend"". It is entirely up to the producer to blend different beans and different roasts and call it what they want.  Edit:
There are some differences in caffeine levels, but a lot of contradictory information out there. I found a great explanation of why the caffeine levels can differ between roasts here, but let me summarize from the post: If you measure your coffee by scoops, light roasted coffee will have more caffeine. Since the beans are denser than a darker roast. However if you weigh out your scoops, darker roasts will have more caffeine, because there is less mass. @ChrisAK is correct, the roasting process does not burn or destroy caffeine, but the level of roast will impact the weight of each bean."
How to preserve crema when pouring a shot into a drink?,"This link from Seasoned Advice might help you. The accepted answer recommends to use an espresso brew pitcher and how to use it. The answer suggests two main things: See more information at that link. It suggests that if you pour it in too fast, you ruin the foam. Too slow and the foam gets stuck. Practice sounds important here."
What water temperature and pour speed are best for pour-over method?,"You're highlighting two differences between the two methods: Short story: Use water just off the boil (about 96Â°C / 205Â°F). I prefer your ""slower"" pour method over your friend's... read on for why. Longer story:
Keeping all other factors identical, here's my take on each. I aggregate information from my own experience and from several other sites (including Blue Bottle and Stumptown and Serious Eats and Coffee Geek). Temperature. Most agree that water for pour-over should be just off the boil, but exact temperature is both difficult to measure and to maintain. Exact recommendations differ, but most (including the 4 above) are approximately in the range of 93-97Â°C / 200-207Â°F. At this temperature, you extract the best balance of the ""right stuff"" from the beans. Much hotter or colder than this and it will have an ""off"" taste, such as more bitter. For example, try brewing coffee at 80Â°C / 175Â°F and see how it tastes compared to coffee brewed with 96Â°C / 205Â°F water. With my technique and equipment, anyway, it would be essentially impossible for me to measure or maintain a temperature this accurately. Removed from the heat, the kettle itself will immediately start to cool; the water will cool between the pour spout and when it hits the grounds in the cone; the water will cool more when sitting on the grounds. For this reason, I take water from a boiling kettle and begin to pour at my leisure. It might be a few degrees too hot at first, but it will probably finish a few degrees too cool. Rate of pouring the water. This seems to have more debate, e.g., on the 4 sites I listed above. Some pour only enough water at a time to have water just covering the grounds (like you and Blue Bottle), and some pour all the way up to the top of the cone (like your friend and Stumptown) -- however, a disadvantage of this all-at-once method is that some of the coffee will get pinned to the side of the cone for the final ""drainage"" and will not spend as much time in contact with the water; therefore some of your friend's coffee grounds will be underextracted. I do something of a hybrid: pour at such a rate as to keep the output at a steady rate. The dripping rate will decrease as the filter gets somewhat clogged with grounds, so I keep very slowly raising the water level in the cone (just exceeding the rate of output); I find this produces the best result. Other ideas are to stir (as Coffee Geek suggests) or pour in batches (as Serious Eats suggests). All that said, other factors (e.g., the quality and freshness of beans) are overwhelmingly more significant than the manner of pouring. You may also want to consider rinsing your filter, and see more about wetting the grounds for coffee bloom."
Is it possible to Cold Brew using an Aeropress?,"Don't brew in the Aeropress itself. Brew in a jar like in classic methods and use the Aeropress only for fast and easy straining, taking care not to stir up the grounds from the bottom of the jar as you're pouring. Most of the coffees you strain out this way should be an absolute breeze. Only the last one you make (assuming a bigger jar) should give you any plunging force trouble, and that's if you insist on getting every last drop out (I know I do)."
Procedure for making a Caffe Americano,"Yes.  Adding water to Espresso is considered an Americano.  Doing it the other way around is called a Long Black. According to that article and below sources, the Long Black preserves the crema, whereas the Americano preparation should not.  The manner in which the pour is done can contribute more to preserving or destroying the crema than the order.  An Americano should have no crema and the crema should be preserved in a Long Black.  It is the preservation or destruction of the crema that will affect the taste (and thus the pour) more than the order."
Are coffee tree berries edible?,"Coffee cherries, as they are properly called, are a thin papery skin and attached mucilage (what we think of as the flesh of the fruit). Coffee cherries are consumed as a drink, cascara, by coffee farmers in Latin America.  Coffee cherries contain more caffeine than coffee, on average, as they do not go though a roasting process. Depending on the green processing / pulping / milling process the coffee went through, coffee cherries often have a bitter and gamy flavor. "
Does heating milk influence taste?,"Yes, heating milk does have a perceptible effect on its taste. That slightly sweet richness we perceive in milk is largely due to lactose. Lactose is the ""milk sugar"" which is a disaccharide of glucose and galactose in solution in the milk. But lactose is also less soluble than sucrose (common table sugar) so it is perceived as less sweet. By increasing the temperature of the milk, you are increasing the solubility of the milk sugars which also increases its perceived sweetness.  If you were steaming the milk (common with lattes and cappuccinos), you would also be incorporating air to create a thicker, creamier consistency, which brings into play the fats and the proteins in the milk, all which play a part in the perceived richness of the beverage. "
How does pressure affect the flavor of espresso?,"Working on a Synesso (prototype), I was lucky enough to be able to play with controlled pre-infusion. They state that their pre-infusion has a pressure of 3-4 bars and "" bring[s] an extra textural element to your brew in the form of a greater volume of crema. It can also lead to a more syrupy mouth-feel overall."" I find this to be mostly true if the pre-infusion was used for about 5 seconds. What I found through personal experience was that, if I kept the pressure consistent, not switching to the full 9 bars, the shot pulled at the same extraction rate, finishing at my desired time. So Keeping dose, time, and extraction the same, the only variable was pressure. I found that the most notable change was a reduction in brightness. The more pronounced acidity and citric flavors were dulled. There was however a silver-lining that gave the pre-infusion a redeeming quality: Because of the reduction in brightness, I found that when using really fresh coffee ( < 4 days old), the pre-infusions reduction in brightness took away from the character metallic taste found with fresh coffee. For that reason, when I am dealing with fresh coffee, I may increase the pre-infusion time (from 5 to 9 seconds for example) and this helps make the espresso palatable. "
Brewing Coffee with instant hot water tap,"Is it, by any chance, demineralised/distilled water, with no minerals added back in? Aside from temperature (which you should check - it's OK if it's cooler, but too cool is no good, and knowing the temperature will help you modify other parameters), it's important to have high quality, odour-free water that is free from impurities and that has the correct mineral content. The SCAA actually specifies water standards (see here). In many developed parts of the world, tap water is fine. However, demineralised water is NOT fine. It will underextract. One solution*: Buy bottled mineral water (like Evian or a cheaper alternative), which usually has too HIGH a mineral content, and blend it with the filtered water from the dispenser. This may seem hard core, but it'd be good as an experiment to see if it cures your woes."
What is the impact of espresso tamper base shape?,"If you only use a double (14g) portafilter basket then you're best to use a 58mm convex tamper. This is because if you look at the basket, in most cases, the sides will slope in. Therefore, if you had a flat 58mm tamper then the you are compressing to outer more than the inner. Obviously the whole point of tamping is to compress the grounds consistently throughout the whole puck, so this would achieve this the best. If you want to use a flat tamper for any reason in this situation, you would be best using a 57mm flat tamper and tap the edge of the portafilter to knock any loose grounds back down into the basket and then rotate the tamper over to produce a flat surface for the water to pass through. If, however, you are using a single (7g) portafilter basket then the 58mm tamper would probably be too wide to compress the grounds evenly as it may not go far enough down in the portafilter basket to tamp it at all. Therefore, you would be best using a 57mm tamper.  If you're using a triple basket then a 58mm convex rules would apply the same as the double basket. This is all based on the assumption that the basket is 58mm. This is the most common size but other sizes do crop up, commonly on older machines which may use a 53mm basket. In this case the flat/convex rules still apply, just with the smaller diameter."
What does coffee leaf tea taste like?,"Had once, made of dehidrated leaves. Lighter than green tea, it ressembles rucola (arugula, in the US)."
Coffee as a factor in rapid scientific progress?,"What to keep in mind is, that during the middle ages, alcoholic drinks were pretty much the main beverage.  Before public sanitation, cholera and other water-transmitted diseases
  were a significant cause of death. Because the process of brewing any
  beer from malt involves mashing and boiling which effectively
  pasteurizes the wort, and the fermentation and hops protect against
  infection, drinking small beer instead of water was one way to escape
  infection. It was not uncommon for workers (including sailors) who
  engaged in heavy physical labor to drink more than 10 Imperial pints
  (5.7 liters) of small beer during a workday to slake their thirst. (Wikipedia on ""Small Beer"", a lightly alcoholic beverage) To quote from an article by Malcom Gladwell What this flood of caffeine did, according to Weinberg and Bealer, was to abet the process of industrializationâto help âlarge numbers of people to coordinate their work schedules by giving them the energy to start work at a given time and continue it as long as necessary.â Until the eighteenth century, it must be remembered, many Westerners drank beer almost continuously, even beginning their day with something called âbeer soup.â (Bealer and Weinberg helpfully provide the following eighteenth-century German recipe: âHeat the beer in a saucepan; in a separate small pot beat a couple of eggs. Add a chunk of butter to the hot beer. Stir in some cool beer to cool it, then pour over the eggs. Add a bit of salt, and finally mix all the ingredients together, whisking it well to keep it from curdling.â) Now they began each day with a strong cup of coffee. One way to explain the industrial revolution is as the inevitable consequence of a world where people suddenly preferred being jittery to being drunk. In the modern world, there was no other way to keep up. Thatâs what Edison meant when he said that genius was ninety-nine per cent perspiration and one per cent inspiration. In the old paradigm, working with your mind had been associated with leisure. It was only the poor who worked hard. (The quintessential pre-industrial narrative of inspiration belonged to Archimedes, who made his discovery, letâs not forget, while taking a bath.) But Edison was saying that the old class distinctions no longer held trueâthat in the industrialized world there was as much toil associated with the life of the mind as there had once been with the travails of the body."
Microplanting my own coffee,"I suppose you can if you can first make a decent coffee plant(s) to first make the coffee. Using this website can help you with your gardening/farming of coffee plants. It is mainly based in the USA so sorry! Some tips to notice for decent coffee beans: Don't put coffee plants in direct sunlight for too long. It will kill your plant and ruin your life. Most coffee plants need little sunlight to survive. It takes 10 minutes of frost/3 hours of direct sunlight outside from May and November will kill it. Place it near or at the east-facing window to get a good morning sun and just enough sunlight from the afternoon. Use warm water but don't flood the pots with it. Making the drinkable coffee will the hard part I guess. Here is a seemingly a good website for roasting at home: Roasting at Home. Remember to use green, unroasted coffee beans!"
Espresso drips out slowly,"As suggested in comment above, descaling or decalcifying your machine may solve your problem. We just run straight distilled white vinegar through ours to do so. Running the machine with distilled water rather than tap water helps keep mineral deposits to a minimum. Also, running it without water can create an airlock (which makes it take a while for the water to pull through), and allows the pump to spin freely, and so can wreak havoc on, or at least weaken the pump. (I don't know what specific pump is employed by your machine, but this page may apply.)  Moreover, in the event that the pump has become weakened, it can be helpful to keep the reservoir completely full of water. I do not believe that a normally working machine would be affected too much by the grinding coarseness selected.  Edited to add: While commercial descaling/decalcifying solutions are available (and might work really well) for this application, the staff on a website selling such reports in the Q&A, ""Breville actually recommends using vinegar to descale their machines while you're under their warranty.""  When deciding what to use, it may be to one's advantage to research whether the product is under warranty, and what the specific manufacturer recommends. Also, take into consideration that the unlisted chemicals that might be found in a given solution could put off foul odors and/or flavors (not that vinegar makes a good perfume, by any means). P.S.  I just found out that the safety data sheet for one descaling liquid contains the following hazard warning (although the company might issue the same warning about vinegar if they sold it):  H315 Causes skin irritation. H319 Causes serious eye irritation."
Which type of coffee grinder is the quietest?,"First, lets ignore blade grinders entirely.  Any grinder that doesn't have a motor will be relatively quiet.  You'll be at the mercy of the crunching beans, but that's it.  Add to this that the more the grinder weighs, or the more ""heft"" it has to it, the quieter it will typically be due to the additional mass damping any vibration.  When adding a motor to the mix, each step between the motor and the burrs adds an opportunity for noise.  As such, a direct drive grinder will typically be quieter than anything involving a gearbox.    The pecking order is basically... Hand Grinder --> Direct Drive Flat Burr --> Direct Drive Conical Burr --> Gear-Reduced Burr While Decibel ratings are available from most manufacturers, they're difficult to translate into a subjective estimate of ""harshness.""  I deal with these regularly and found that some of my favorite grinders are technically louder than several others, including the Baratza Vario. The difference is that they have a much more mellow drone rather than the gear motor's quieter whine."
What is a shot?,"They are referring to a ""shot"" of espresso.  The Italian standards are that it is a volume of 25 mL  plus or minus ten percent.  Additional shots in a drink indicate more espresso flavor and a higher caffeine content."
How can I make filtering my cold brew easier?,I tried making cold brew for the first time recently and I just poured the whole mess through the reusable metal screen filter that came with my cheap drip coffee machine.  My drip machine is the style where the top opens to add both coffee and water sort of like this:  So I just put the metal filter in and poured the cold brew straight into the filter allowing the filtered brew to flow into the regular pot below. It worked pretty well for the 8 cups or so that I made and it looked like I probably could have gotten away with pouring a bit more. 
Is coffee really useful for alcohol hangovers,"No.  Coffee is often offered to people perhaps about to pass out so that they will stay awake long enough that they can be kicked out of an establishment.   Alcohol causes dehydration, electrolyte imbalance and taxes the liver.  To this extent standard medical treatment is fluid, electrolytes, and vitamins.  Caffeine is never used in a medical setting to treat alcohol overdose or withdrawal.  "
What volume of beans yields a tablespoon of ground coffee?,"Here's an opportunity to start refining your brewing process. Coffee brewers, including myself, tend to use weight as our measuring unit as opposed to volume since bean sizes vary significantly already without accounting for origin or roast level. All of these factors will change the real amount of coffee you believe you have once ground and also change the extraction parameters needed to make a cup of coffee of the 'same strength'. From what it sounds, I doubt that the beans you use are of the same variety as the pre-ground coffee you used to use. Not all coffee will taste the same nor brew the same, and the best way to track and refine your brewing to your taste is to measure accurately your bean (origin/blend, roast level, weight used, grind size), water (to coffee ratio, temperature, purity), and extraction time. Depending on what brewing method you use there may be more parameters you will have to account for but ultimately the aforementioned factors will always play a role in any form of coffee brewing. Start by weighing an amount of pre-ground coffee that you used previously to find out how much coffee you used exactly and start by grinding that much of your new beans to brew. Good luck!"
Can decaf coffee be addictive?,"Since decaf coffee isn't the same as caffeine-free coffee, the key point regarding addiction is the amount of daily servings of decaf coffee that deliver the 100 milligrams of caffeine needed to acquire some sort of dependence 1. The amount of such cups of decaf will vary according to the brand chosen. According to a study published in the Journal of Analytical Toxicology, and cited in the article Decaf coffee isn't caffeine free, they say that in average, a cup of decaf can hold about one-twentieth of the caffeine you get in a normal drip brewed coffee. In that same article, they state that drinking more cups of decaf can compensate the lack of caffeine, and still be able to produce addiction. So, it is indeed a matter of how many cups of decaf you drink."
Use for old grounds?,"They are very good as de-odourizers, we use them in the kitchen and sometimes in a small perforated plastic container in the footwell of the backseats in our car. The fragrant smell lasts a long time also surprisingly. Also it seems to be useful in fridges too. That link lists the following: So the above is quite a good list of uses that could be applicable for your situation I just found 34 uses here too, I have to say though that using ground coffee as a method for salting a path didn't work for me. Additonal uses:"
Is there more caffeine with an AeroPress?,"Aeropress coffee (hearby called Aerpresso in this post) is more concentrated than regular drip coffee.  However, if you are using similar amounts of grounds as you would in a drip machine, you shouldn't notice any difference.  Caffeine is highly soluble in hot water and most any extraction method utilizing hot water will result in nearly full extraction of caffeine from grounds. Aerpresso ends up somewhere in caffeine concentration between espresso (very concentrated) and drip coffee (less concentrated).  However, the total amount of caffeine is dependent more on the amount of grounds used that the extraction method (with the above listed methods).  So the the final answer is no.  There isn't more caffeine, but the Aerpresso is more concentrated."
Ground coffee or beans,"Ground beans have a much larger surface area by weight than whole beans. When the surface of the bean is exposed to air chemical reactions take place. I doubt that these reactions have been completely characterized but at a minimum they include some loss of aromatic oils. In other words, the processes that lead to a judgment that coffee is ""old"" happen faster in ground coffee.   You can do the experiment easily and cheaply by comparing the results of coffee made with freshly-ground and pre-ground versions of same brand/date coffee. You can always borrow a grinder. The experiment might not work if both samples of coffee are old (or poor quality). Otherwise I think you would notice a difference. Whether the difference is worth paying for is a different question; but the only costs are a grinder and time to grind the beans.  A short answer to the question about brands might be: good, fresh Arabica beans are similar in many ways, up to roasting. Some people prefer a light roast, others medium or dark. Once you decide, find a brand that does what you like consistently. "
Will I be addicted to caffeine?,"According to this review published in Psychopharmacology, it is very much not a myth. The caffeine-withdrawal syndrome has been well characterized and there
  is sufficient empirical evidence to warrant inclusion of caffeine
  withdrawal as a disorder in the DSM and revision of diagnostic
  criteria in the ICD. More explicitly (emphasis my own): Of 49 symptom categories identified, the following 10 fulfilled
  validity criteria: headache, fatigue, decreased energy/activeness,
  decreased alertness, drowsiness, decreased contentedness, depressed
  mood, difficulty concentrating, irritability, and foggy/not
  clearheaded. In addition, flu-like symptoms, nausea/vomiting, and
  muscle pain/stiffness were judged likely to represent valid symptom
  categories. In experimental studies, the incidence of headache was 50%
  and the incidence of clinically significant distress or functional
  impairment was 13%. Typically, onset of symptoms occurred 12â24 h
  after abstinence, with peak intensity at 20â51 h, and for a duration
  of 2â9 days. In general, the incidence or severity of symptoms
  increased with increases in daily dose; abstinence from doses as low
  as 100 mg/day produced symptoms. Research is reviewed indicating that
  expectancies are not a prime determinant of caffeine withdrawal and
  that avoidance of withdrawal symptoms plays a central role in habitual
  caffeine consumption. As for health risks, beyond the symptoms of withdrawal, caffeine has been linked to a number of conditions, such as: So to summarize: Yes, you can be addicted to caffeine. No, it is not a myth. And it seems like you need as little as 100mg a day to be addicted, that is the equivalent of 1.5 espresso shots, according to this link.. Prolonged caffeine use can be harmful, moderation is recommended."
"Why is drinking Espresso in the afternoon fine, while milk coffee is not?","It is a cultural issue, not a health one. Traditionally, rich, big coffee drinks like a cappuccino are drunk in the morning in Italy with breakfast whereas espresso is what is drunk in the afternoon. The reasoning for this is that you can take your time and savor a cappuccino in the morning because presumably you are not at work yet, but in the afternoon you are just in and out for a quick energy infusion on a 15 minute break and you don't have the time to drink anything but a shot or two of espresso.  In America people tend to do just the opposite or just drink what they want, when they want which can lead to some judgement when visiting Italy. "
US equivalent of SCAE?,"There is a Specialty Coffee Association of America, and they have a professional development program with certificates.  (Also various awards and recognition programs.) I'd be surprised if there was not some formal parallel in the two trade associations. The SCAE's ""about-us"" page says: ""Together with the Specialty Coffee Association of America (SCAA), we represent the speciality sector on the International Coffee Organization's Private Sector Consultative Board."" The SCAA Chronicle from Oct. 2010 carried a story about a joint venture with SCAE called World Coffee Events, to ""develop and manage competitive events on behalf of both organizations."" Added: There is also a Specialty Coffee Association of Japan, established in 2003.  SCAE began in 1998, and SCAA in 1982."
How often do I need to change the filter on a siphon?,"I've typically used the same cloth filter on a hario syphon for several (2 - 3 probably) months of continuous use (1 or 2 syphons daily). We clean the cloth after each use using a mild detergent, hot water and a soft scrubbing brush. Rinse very well after each wash. Typically, after a week or so we soak the cloth in oxyclean or similar for a couple of hours to get it super clean and then follow this up with a normal wash and thorough rinse. The coffee will stain the cloths after the first use, so don't expect it to return to the same colour it was originally no matter how often or well you wash it. When we first bought a syphon about five years ago we were recommended to store the filter in a glass jar of water in the fridge to prevent it drying out between uses. If we aren't planning to use the filter for a while, we toss the cloth, clean the metal part and let it dry. You can also clean the filter (with or without the cloth) in the dishwasher but I'd still recommend giving it a thorough rinse afterwards. The cloths are fairly cheap and in my experience easy to find online so use your judgement - if you think it's time to switch cloths, it's probably time to use a new cloth!"
"Is there a group identity for coffee drinkers who care, but compromise?","Based on the wording of your question; I believe there is no current classification for this denomination in the coffee market.  When you compare this with the electronics market; there are devices developed for the ""prosumer"" market which are targeted at professional consumers (average Joe that can make it rain), but are not used to their full capacity. For example, I can buy the latest Macbook Pro laptop and only use it for iTunes, or buy a high powered Microsoft Surface Studio PC and only use Microsoft Paint because Photoshop is too expensive.  To start generating momentum to classify this marketing group, you could say that this group of people (without trying to be offensive) would be classified as lazy prosumers?"
Differences between Chemex & V60,"Here's a few more things to add to @fredley's answer. Since the water is going to be in contact with the grounds for a longer time (1- using greater volume of water, and 2- Chemex filter will be slower) you're going to get more of the bitter notes that you get (in general) by using a longer brewing time. Acidity will be offset somewhat by the bitterness. I find Chemex to be like a filter-coffee version of the body of a French Press preparation, though with no sediment. Compared to the throughput of V60 filters, @fredley hit it on the nose. Though you are asking about taste specifically, there are other factors. Like @fredley said, the filter paper in Chemex is much thicker and water drains through it significantly more slowly. You'll probably want to use a coarser grind (and very even grind) than you would for V60 or Melitta-style filters. Fines are the enemy of Chemex, causing the filter to clog and welling (see this question about ""welling up"" in a Chemex for more on that). Certainly use the best burr grinder you can and don't delay in the pouring action. Technique is ""more important"" (read as: ""finicky"") with Chemex, I think, than other pour-over systems. See preparation guides such as from Chemex itself, or Blue Bottle, or Stumptown, or search for others."
How does one descale an espresso machine (and how often to do it)?,"You can use a solution of citric acid and some espresso machine manufacturers will sell this specifically, you can use general purpose descaler, for which there should be instructions on how much to dilute it by. Talking from experience it depends on how hard the water is where you live and you should really do it every month if it is a hard water area. I also found that I need to remove the fine filter where the coffee is pumped out to remove the gasket seal and clean all of the above, I was lazy and neglected my Gaggia for about 6 months and after a couple years the solenoid pump died. The less hassle method would be to use bottled soft mineral water. For instance I have started to only use this with my kettle and there is no limescale build up since switching 1 1/2 months ago, whilst before, using Brita filtered water would start to show limescale after a week and I'd need to descale after 3 weeks. These are the instructions on my descaling solution for a coffee machine: Add 100ml of solution to 500ml of water and add to water reservoir,
  turn on and run through the machine. Then run 2 full reservoirs of
  water before using again. I remember with citric acid you had to pump it through and then leave for 30 minutes and then fully flush a few times. Here is a youtube video from Gaggia about performing this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SPkjWJzUJQ The key thing here is that if you don't do it then limescale starts to form on the metal filter and gasket seals which will affect the flow rate. This isn't the worst bit though, like with any heating system that uses hard water, the hard limescale will inhibit the heating and pumping performance which can lead to a complete pump failure which is what happened to my machine, I recommend using citric acid (which is a weak acid and safe to consume in diluted form) and/or bottled mineral water."
Reduce power of popcorn popper for roasting coffee,"Rather than playing with electricity and wiring you could actually just move the roasting bed/area away from your heat source and accomplish close to the same thing.   I started roasting with a popper as well.  The hole in the popper was roughly 3 inches so I got a 3 to 4 inch duct adapter, a 4 inch flour sifter and mushed it all together, similar to this.  The result was that I moved the coffee away from the heat source.  The sifter also allows you to stir and get more even results.  I think I went from 4 to 5 minute roast time to 7 or 8 minutes with this method and the parts were very cheap.  I believe the forum post for that picture actually has additional mods close to what you may be looking for if you actually want to take your popper apart and try rewiring it."
Convert MahlkÃ¶nig EK43 settings to other grinders,"I had the same question as well. The Mahklonig scale is from 1 (fine) - 11 (coarse), based on some images, so you could assume that 7.3 is about a drip grind, and then adjust to taste based on results"
How vigorously should I heat my moka?,"I'm going to start by answering your last question first just for fun. In this site, it says that: Place the pot over a low flame. A low flame increases the brew time, which enhances the flavor. At a later step, youâll want a slow trickle of espresso instead of a full-force fountain. You would want a nice, long brew time. The flavor will be enhanced rather than the quick brew time with a large fire. So flavor and brew time can be changed depending on the size of your heat. To answer that question, YES it is a great idea to turn down the heat. EXTRA: The site also shows how to make a nice moka (not spam)! Second, you really answered your last question yourself. Low heat is better than high heat. Now I'm going to answer your second question. Looks like this site uses Italian pots just like your induction hob. For stovetop pots and not stovepot pots, it says that: When the water in the tank has been exhausted, that's when you hear the âgurgleâ that signifies the drink is ready to pour (approximately 4 to 5 minutes). Looks like 4 to 5 minutes is just the right time for the coffee to be ready for extraction here. You should know the sound of someone using mouthwash and gurgling. The coffee pot will start to produce that sound when coffee is ready. Now I will answer your first question. I can't seem to find any significant information on your question, so I'll take a shot at it.  Supposedly, it might be your decision.  Maybe some people like this setting while others like another. I don't know what your standards for a good brew is so I'll just say that you should choose it. Sorry for the lack of information! I hope this answer answered all your questions!"
Does there exist a coffee which is not bitter?,"To answer this shortly, no there is no coffee that has no bitterness. Bitterness in coffee is determined by different factors on which I will elaborate a bit now. First of all there are bitter substances naturally in coffee. The most obvious and widely known one would be caffein. However in truth only around 15% of the bitterness in coffee comes from caffein. There are hundreds of active substances in coffee, some of which are bitter. Most importantly are chlorogenic acids. They contribute most to the bitterness. So it is unlikely that you will ever find a coffee that has no trace of bitterness at all. There are however some influenceable factors that contribute to bitterness. I want to address first the roasting process, bean type and origins and then preparation methods and some tweaks that might help. As I've said before, key to how bitter coffee tastes are the kind of chemical compounds found in it. And the roasting process determines exactly this. When the beans are heated chlorogenic acids are broken down into first acid lactones and later in the roast process into phenylindanes. Chlorogenic acid itself is not bitter, but the compounds it breaks down into are and especially phenylindanes. As they appear later in the roasting, darker roasts tend to be more bitter than light roasts. So my advice here would be to try very light roasted beans. Here's another source that also refers to some of the other points I'm making. There are two main types of Beans, Arabica and Robusta with Robusta containing both much more caffein as well as chlorogenic acids. Thus stay clear of Robusta or mixed coffees, since it will add extra bitterness to your cup. Also in my experience light roasted african coffees, e.g. ethiopean or kenyan coffees are the mildest coffees when it comes to bitterness, but do have more acidity than central or south american coffees.  First of all, avoid espresso. Because of the pressure applied to the coffee much more bitter compounds are extracted. A general rule of thumb is that with higher extraction you will extract more bitter compounds, that quickly dominate the flavor of the coffee. The bitter compounds are usually extracted at later stages of the extraction process, thus the shorter your extraction the less bitterness. I would suggest you try pour overs, as extraction can be controlled very well and they are just by design made for a cup of coffee with a brighter, more acidic flavor. V60 or even better a Chemex are your best options. The thick Chemex paper will filter more of the bitter compounds and leave more of the acidic, fruity, floral flavors. There are plenty of instructions on youtube or also here in the forum. Avoid overextraction due to a too small grind size, too high water-grounds contact time and too hot water (around 94Â°C would be perfect, you can go a bit lower however). Additionally make sure you have a good grinder that produces a consistent particle size. If the variation is too big (the downward variation in this case) and if the grinder produces too many fines (very small coffee particles), they will be over extracted and add bitterness. I hope this can help you in your quest for finding a coffee that you like. I suggest you also go to some local roasters and talk to them. They might be able to help you, suggest coffees etc. and who knows, maybe you can even interest one of them in experimenting with roast profiles that minimize bitterness."
Which of these espresso variant contain more caffeine?,"Lets's do some Espresso math: Taking an espresso12 as base unit, we can conclude: So the caffeine per serving would be: ristretto < espresso = americano < lungo (This does not consider that all these drinks can be made with double or triple shots, but the math stays the same.) 1For completeness and as the question came up in comments: According to the Istituto Nazionale Espresso Italiano an espresso is made with 7g coffee per 25ml cup. On naming:
The terms for coffee varieties all contain an ellipsis, effectively omitting the word CaffÃ¨ (coffee): 2 Espresso means ""expressed"", referring to the preparation method where water is pushed with high pressure through the grounds, as opposed to coffee from a Caffettiera or made by other methods. (Other sources claim it stands for ""explicitly"", meaning a cup that was prepared individually for every single guest or serving. ""espresso"" is the past participle of two italian verbs. Perhaps a happy coincidence.) 3 Ristretto means ""restrained"". Easy to remember if one keeps in mind that in the old espresso machines water was pumped manually with a long lever - one lever ""pump"" resulting in one cup of espresso. If the movement was restrained: voilÃ¡, a ristretto. 4 Lungo means ""long"" - see details above."
What's The Difference Between Paper and Long-Lasting Filters,"tl;dr: Permanent filters win on cost over time. Paper filters win on performance, clean-up, and health. Flavour is personal preference. Composting paper filters and spent grounds alleviates most of the environmental benefit of permanent filter.  My conclusion: paper filters, discarded into a compost pile, win hands down. Use of permanent versus one-time-use filters is a perennial question, with both concrete and personal-preference arguments. In addition to the link in the original post, there are a few other online articles with comparisons, such as: From those and my personal experience, I extracted an overview and conclusions, below. Unfortunately I've written a lot of text here, but there's a lot of facets. I've focused basically on paper versus metal mesh, as the most common types; I maintain the conclusions are similar regardless of material. Material. There are several materials used for permanent filters, including the following: All of these surely have different properties, but properties that I focus on here are common to most. One-time-use filters are predominantly paper, but could also be bamboo, natural fibre, or other material. See also this question for a comparison of brown versus white paper filters. Performance. Paper filters are a finer filter; a permanent filter will permit some larger particles through to the cup. I find that a pot brewed with a permanent mesh filter will have a fine silt of coffee grounds at the bottom. For this same reason, some recommend to use a coarser grind for permanent filters. Paper filters are also claimed to filter out some compounds (e.g., diterpenes such as cafestol, which may increase blood cholesterol levels). Coffee brewed by other (non-paper-filter) methods have a higher concentration of cafestol in the resulting beverage.  See article [2] for more health claims of paper filters. On the other hand [3] says that paper filters filter out some good things, such as antioxidants, but I haven't seen that claim anywhere else. Flavour. Link number [4] claims better taste on paper filter than permanent filter (I happen to agree).  Permanent filters should also allow more oils to pass through, which will certainly have an impact on flavour; this is probably personal preference. The grit that passes through will also have a bittering effect over time, but probably not significant if you're drinking right away. Some (e.g., [1]) say nylon/plastic mesh will retain off-flavours over time. Cost. Varies greatly, but one can find permanent filters that are said to last for ""years"" for a few quid ($/â¬/Â£) up to 20-30 quid. Though dependent on usage and other factors, you'll have reasonable expectation of saving money over time by using a permanent filter. Clean-up. Clearly, the spent grounds from re-usable filters must be cleaned out; paper filters and their spent grounds can be pitched wholesale.  See another question about how often and how much to clean a permanent filter. On the other hand, [3] claims that permanent filters are cleaner, but I don't agree. Waste / environmental issues. I couldn't find any data on how much energy is used to produce a paper filter versus a reusable filter, but many uses would certainly be necessary to break even! As far as waste volume though, you'll make up the difference with paper filters pretty quickly (but composting the paper instead alleviates this!). Cleaning permanent filters additionally requires water and detergent. Though, you may wish to rinse your paper filters, so water use is debatable. Ultimately, reusable filters will eventually wear out and need to be replaced. My Conclusion. For my money, personally, I prefer the paper filter:"
Is it possible to feel any effects after chewing one coffee bean?,"First I want to draw a comparison between how much caffeine is in a coffee bean versus a cup of coffee, a cup of tea, or a double espresso. In a standard cup of coffee, there is approximately 150 mg of caffeine. In a cup of black tea, steeped for 3 - 5 minutes there is approximately 50 mg of caffeine. In a double espresso there is approximately 60 - 90 mg of caffeine depending on the roast, grind, extraction time, etc. In one dark roasted espresso bean there is approximately 6 mg of caffeine according to this source. If a person is extremely sensitive to caffeine, they would probably be able to feel the effect of 6 mg of caffeine. However, if someone is a coffee drinker, the likelihood that this caffeine is actually affecting them is very unlikely. If your friend never ingests soda, coffee, tea, or caffeine in any form then he may have felt some of the effects. In my opinion, the majority of the way your colleague was feeling was probably a placebo effect. Edit: Coming back to this answer, I neglected to mention the effect of the taste of the coffee bean. Taste and aroma can powerfully affect and stimulate the brain. Due to the relatively strong taste resulting from chewing up a roasted coffee bean, this may have also contributed to the reported feeling of stimulation."
What preparation method yields the most caffeine?,"The first thing you want to do is choose the right bean and the right roast. Longer roasting removes some of the caffeine from the bean, so a lighter roast would be preferred. Additionally you should chose Robusta beans, since their inherent caffeine content is higher than that of arabica beans. The next step is the grinding. The smaller you grind, the easier it is to extract ""material"" from the ground. This is due to the additional surface area you expose. Then the last step is the extraction. The longer you expose the ground to water, the more substances you absorb. The extraction roughly has three steps: Usually you try to stop extraction after the second step, to have the coffee taste nicely. By that point in time most of the caffeine is already extracted. If you'd want to get all the caffeine out of a ground, you'd have to go through with extracting the bitterness, too. But for general purpose drinkable coffee it's definitely preferrable to stop after extracting the sweetness"
Theobromine in coffee,"According to the Dr. Duke's Phytochemical and Ethnobotanical Databases, Coffee Arabica has one of the largest amount of theobromine in its seed (20 ppm). However, this amount is just a bit more than 1/2500 th of the amount what Cocoa includes (48 223 ppm). So... Coffee is not really considered a theobromine source, but Cocoa is."
Coffee options for those with a weak stomach?,"Preparation method will have a big factor in extraction, acidity (such as in @Patrick's answer) among them.  The method used (temperature, time, technique, filtering method) will have a big impact on what comes out in the cup. Astringency and bitterness might also be factors that have physical effects for you; see this article for a discussion of the differences between the two, causes, and related factors. Try cold brew. Cold brew coffee will have lower acidity, and might be a good option for you; here's an article that discusses different preparation methods, but in the cold-brew section it has an anecdote of someone with similar ""stomach"".  Here's another on cold-brew and acidity. See also the cold-brew tag. Paper filtering seems to remove some acids, but it's not clear whether these are the type that might argue with your stomach. For example, The AeroPress FAQ claims that their paper filter creates lower acidity brew, but I can't immediately find a better, proper reference. Try some antacid. If you're experiencing heartburn, try a calcium-based antacid before and/or after drinking the coffee, and see if that changes things. (Disclaim: This isn't medical advice, don't take it if you shouldn't, talk to a doctor about meds, etc.). Science! If you're into thicker scientific reading, here's a paper on extraction methods and outcomes, if you're into that sort of thing. It discusses various aspects of acids and acidity. It looks pretty dense."
Is it necessary to sort beans after roasting?,"It will affect the flavor. Whether that's particularly noticeable depends on the bean, the roast you're going for, and how much variance there is in the roast. Whether it matters to you is a personal decision.  In my experience, over-roasted beans are worth removing from a light roast (I tend to prefer city roast at darkest), even if they're not actually burnt - the flavor of even a few dark beans will tend to overwhelm the more delicate flavors of a lighter roast.  That said, I use a popcorn popper; there tends to be a lot of variation in the results. If you have a better roasting setup, you can probably avoid a lot of the hassle. "
Is harvest time important for coffee quality?,"Yes, it does, but it's much more complex than that :-) Harvest times vary greatly depending on the latitude, altitude and variety of beans being harvested. There is a very large table here which illustrates the variety of harvest/shipping seasons, as well as the optimum points of both. In general, December-February is best, but some countries vary anywhere from June to October. Some countries with a larger variety of crops have a lot of different 'Best' points, e.g. Kenya: 
(The top brown/red line indicates harvest times, Red Bs indicate the optimum harvest times.)"
What are the flavor characteristics of under-roasted coffee?,"I suppose under-roasting and over-roasting are somewhat relative. I generally prefer a lighter roast (just after the completion of first crack) which might be under-roasted to some tastes.  I've occasionally stopped a roast too early and then it's under-roasted to me (and I suspect anybody else) as well! In those cases, the coffee tastes sour and I don't mean acidic, but sour. The sourness is a little like the taste in bread that has got old and soured. It also has a taste that's reminiscent of tea. I like tea but not when when it's meant to be coffee! (If you've ever had Qishr - ""tea"" made from the dried coffee cherry husks - it's pretty close to that, which is not surprising I suppose.)
There are also other coffee tastes which are just absent from under-roasted coffee - there is simply less of that ""coffee"" taste (and it also disappears of the tongue very quickly) and the coffee also has less body. If they are not too under-roasted, I find letting the beans rest a lot longer than normal can help a bit."
How do I keep slime from collecting in my drip tray?,"If what you're seeing is mold or algae you may want to add a few table spoons of salt to the drip pan. I'm guessing that your slime is probably a fungus of some kind, rather than an algae. It has found a rather nice living arrangement for a fungi. Plenty of warm water and decomposing coffee, with very little light. Salt should in most cases prevent fungal growth, this may sound odd but it will dehydrate the cells even when they're immersed in water, sort of a ""water, water everywhere but not a drop to drink"". If you would rather get high tech with it, you could try a UV light, similar to the ones used in AC systems. The harsh UV rays will kill most molds and prevent them from colonizing."
How does Nel Drip compare to paper filtered Pour Over?,"Lets answer this question with some data! My company uses machine learning, data science, and sensory science to build flavor profiling and quality control tools for the craft beverage industry.  Lets use some of our 9,000+ full sensory reviews to examine the difference between Paper Filter Pour-over coffees and the Nel. TL;DR: Nel takes a ton of work to do properly and consistently - but produces a distinct and interesting flavor profile difficult if not impossible to achieve through other brewing methods.  Data  7,371 Reviews of Central American Washed Coffees brewed in Chemex, Beehouse, kalita wave, or  V60 with a paper filter Average of 7 day old coffee with a SD of 5 days, the data is evenly dichotomously split between a ratio of 40:600 and 35:400 (up-dose) grams of water : grams of coffee 2,143 Reviews of Central American Washed Coffees brewed in Nel; Average of 30 day old coffee with a SD of 10 days, brewed at approx 50g coffee to 180 ml water Proper Nel uses old beans, usually a month past roast - often considered stale! This is a historical antecedent - fresh coffee was hard to come by when the dutch we're the only trading partner (for some time, and the only one shipping coffee) for Japan. Pour-Over Methods produce the best flavor profile using fresh coffee (less than 14 days from roast, on average).  Nel: Very high coffee to water ratio, hovering around ~50g coffee to ~200g water. Very slow pour. It should take at least 6 min to pour the water through the grinds. Pour-over: More standard coffee to water ration, often around ~40g coffee to ~600g water. Standard pour rate, with total brew time around 4 min.  For this section of the analysis, I will be using the Gastrograph to communicate complex flavor profiles consistently and simply. On the Gastrograph, the intensity is shown ranging from 0, the center of the graph, to 5 (the outer most point).

Best way to store unroasted/raw coffee?,I have a few different varieties of green beans that I have stored in freezer style plastic bags for going on 1+ year now and there is no mold present.  I keep them stored at room temperate with as much air as possible removed from the bag.  I roast a few batches a year and always get the same results out of my beans regardless of how long they have been stored.
What is the process for brewing egg coffee?,"I decided to give this a shot and made up a recipe myself: I started out by simply making a press pot of coffee:  then, after letting the coffee cool and steep for a few minutes, mixed up and tempered two eggs (shell and all) by spooning in some of the coffee and grounds:  This part starts to look pretty nasty, but persevere:  Whip the eggs into an emulsion (or close to it; this will be much easier with a whisk), and pour them into the press pot. Once you're done you should have an eggy crema on top (I think I needed one or two more eggs for the entire press pot):  As far as I can tell, it just tastes like coffee (the egg is hardly noticeable, and just tones down the flavor a bit like cream or milk). Using one or two more eggs (for a full pot like this) would probably have helped. Also, make sure you let the coffee cool enough before tempering your eggs, or you'll just wind up with scrambled egg floating in coffee despite the fact that you tempered it."

Is coffee a solution or an emulsion?,"A cup of coffee is definitely a solution, in the sense that it is composed of dissolved solutes. The solvation occurs once water is introduced. While, there is always a limit to how much of a substance can be solvated in a given amount of solvent, with coffee you're likely to not reach the point of creating a super-saturated solution in normal conditions. If you were to take a pot of brewed coffee, and boil it, removing the solvent (water) you will likely reach a point as to where the solution is supersaturated, followed by precipitation of a crude extract. Now is coffee an emulsion? I have heard that typical brewed coffee contains oils from the bean (likely oils that can be seen on darker roasts). If this is the case, then we could say that coffee is both a solution and an emulsion! EDIT: I know this is an older question but I want to clarify some definitions:
Under IUPAC definition of an emulsion:  Note 4: An emulsion is termed an oil/water (o/w) emulsion if the
  dispersed phase is an organic material and the continuous phase is
  water or an aqueous solution and is termed water/oil (w/o) if the dispersed
  phase is water or an aqueous solution and the continuous phase is an
  organic liquid (an ""oil""). So, when I say coffee is a solution, I'm referring to dissolved solids in the aqueous phase (an aqueous solution). When I say it's an emulsion, I'm referring to the ""oils"" of the coffee dispersed in the aqueous solution. By the above definition, coffee would qualify as an o/w emulsion composed with an aqueous solution."

How is KahlÃºa made?,"From Kahlua's website it looks like they process sugar cane into molasses, ferment it, and distil it before adding coffee.

What is the ideal method/temp of brewing Turkish coffee in a Cezve?,"You should heat your coffee upto about 70 degrees Celcius so it builds a foam or froth but do not let it boil! You need to keep it at this stage for as long as you can, and if the coffee starts to get to hot and appears to rise then move it off the heat and repeat at most 2 times. A few important things are Here's a link to a useful page on Turkish coffee world website with a method for making Turkish coffee.

How V60 and Aeropress affect flavor,"That sounds like the generalization that drip or pour over brewing is better for light roasts and stronger brewing methods are better for darker roasts.   I'll counter that by saying that I often use my Aeropress for lighter roasts and my Clever Dripper for dark roasts and those cups come out just fine.   The Aeropress makes a sort of quasi-espresso cup that isn't true espresso, but is much stronger than just strong coffee.  I've found that it is unsuitable or less than satisfactory for beans that aren't recommended for espresso brewing.  While the Aeropress allows less control over ""brew"" strength.  The V60 should be more flexible.  Varying the grind and pour speed should allow a level of control not present with an Aeropress.  "
What is the idea behind serving espresso with a lemon peel?,"This article states that it is possible it started in WW II when cafe's used lemons to clean their espresso cups due to the fact that water was scarce in Italy. And the ""tradition"" stuck and expanded. "
Home roasting and ventilation,"I finally noticed that the chaff collection unit is actually several pieces that don't fit as well as they could.  I took it apart and sealed the seams with high temperature engine gasket sealant.  I then used the sealant to connect the vent hose to the top of the chaff collector (also a very rough fit).  I still have some problems with cold air inflow on the vent through the house wall, but I can disconnect the vent hose from the house vent and stuff it with rags or other temporary insulation material if I choose. All said and done the machine is leaking far less than half the smoke it was previously.  It seems the chaff collector was a main part of the problem.  This makes sense as the exhaust there is making a 90 degree turn, expanding into a chamber, then compressing back into another pathway. UPDATE:   Complete misunderstanding of the problem.  The exhaust vent is sized down and WILL connect and properly seal on a piece of exhaust pipe fitting.  I am not sure why the company sized it this way, but sealing the seams and using a piece of exhaust joint (rather than slipping the vent hose/pipe over the exhaust) works like it was probably designed to.   "
Is espresso pre-infusion included in total brew timing?,"Based in my experience, the ""23-28secs"" starts counting since you press the button of the water.
Those 3-4secs of ""pre-infusion"" that you mention, are part of the whole timing process. But remember, it will always depends on your set-up (type-of coffee, roast, grind, etc...) You can measure this empirically watching brewing guides, like:"
What is the difference between Melange and Cappuccino?,"Melange describes different beverages with coffee in different places. The Melange from Vienna is indeed very similar to Cappuccino. However, Melange is sometimes not produced using Espresso, but normal filter coffee. In Switzerland, in contrast, Melange is made with whipped cream instead of milk."
How to make coffee concentrate,"Just make cold brew! It's called ""cold brew"", but you can still make good hot coffee out of it. Cold brew is essentially hyperconcentrated, but slow-brewed, coffee. It's very popular in the United States in the summer, because it's very easy to make excellent iced coffee with a cold brew concentrate. (Just add water and ice.) But you can also make a cup of hot coffee out of cold brew concentrate: just add hot water instead of cold water and ice.  Here's a recipe, but I'll summarize it. You need:  Pour water over coffee in a large bowl or pitcher and stir. Cover with a tea towel and let sit on the counter (or fridge) for 24 hours. You can vary the coffee:water ratio and brewing time depending on your preferences. Strain thoroughly. Reserve the delicious liquid and discard the grounds. The concentrate will keep in the refrigerator for up to a week.  To make a cup of hot coffee, add about 2 parts hot water to 1 part cold brew (depending on your taste). Add the hot water slowly until it's tasty to you. Dilute with a similar amount of cold water for iced coffee - then add ice. Add milk, sugar, and other fixings as desired. (If you're drinking it iced, you'll want to use simple syrup to sweeten, since plain sugar won't dissolve well in cold liquid.) Bon appetit!"
What variety of coffee berries are good for jam?,"After much chatter about this question, I must admit that I've become a little obsessed with this concept. Maybe a lot obsessed... Concept.  I see three other possible ways of making a jam/conserve/preserve/marmalade/jelly/... out of coffee fruit (i.e., coffee berries / coffee cherries) or coffee cherry husks (by ""husks"" I mean basically the fruit with seeds removed -- everything except the beans), in decreasing order of actual coffee fruit content: Exclusions. Note that I am not including coffee jelly, which is made of (conventional, roasted) brewed coffee, as noted previously; also not including making a jam out of roasted or un-roasted coffee beans themselves. Both of those are interesting concepts, but discounted here to be left as separate topics. Progress! I searched a bunch for a source of any coffee cherries or dried husks. Amazon didn't even seem to sell any (must have been my error!?). I asked around at a few local coffee shops, with little progress. I found a few pages, like this one and one from a NYT blog that gave a glimmer of hope that husks (at least) could be found. Both of those articles point to Counter Culture Coffee as selling these, but they're not in stock. An immensely helpful person from CCC pointed me to Verve Coffee Roasters, who sell coffee cherry husks for cascara. So as to get my lot before the rush on coffee cherry husks that would undoubtedly come from this post, I ordered some. Since I'm having trouble being patient and waiting for the stuff to arrive, I started... Seeking Seasoned Advice! With all due credit to OP @EricPlaton, I posted a question over at Seasoned Advice about the concept of making jam or preserves out of coffee cherry husks or whole coffee cherries. I wrote a comment about this above, but I still hope OP doesn't mind! More to come, and any comments or suggestions are kindly welcomed."
What actually happens with the ground coffee that lost its flavour?,"As far as I know the aroma is gone first, the oils begin to dry out and the taste goes down as well. I don't know how long it takes the caffeine to go away. I have drunk coffee over a year old and there still was caffeine. (I go camping and there was a bag left over from the previous year.) On a different note - as a lifelong NYer I don't see how living in a small space precludes having a grinder. Even - gasp - a cheap krup kitchen grinder is better than buying bags of store ground coffee. (IMHO) Although I would buy a hand grinder instead. "
Why does instant coffee have a poor reputation?,"Because the taste and aroma are horrible. I've been places (for instance Shanghai and Beijing) where it's hard to get a cup of coffee outside of business areas catering to foreigners.  The instant coffee is terrible. It is not a pleasure to drink. It's only palatable (to me) with a ton of evaporated milk and a lot of sugar. For someone  who usually drinks coffee black this ruins the coffee experience. To answer your question: for people who love the smell and taste of good, freshly roasted, freshly ground coffee - instant coffee simply doesn't compare. Hence the poor reputation."
Blade grinders: any advantage over burr grinders besides cost?,"You can use a blade grinder for nuts and spices as well, provided that the 'chamber' and blades are 100% stainless steel. It's pretty easy to clean the oils that would otherwise affect your next batch of beans. That's not the case with a burr grinder, especially the ceramic variety - a hand-full of hazelnuts in one of those will mean anything coming out of it picking up that taste for quite a while. I use my blade grinder mostly for that these days, since I own several burr grinders. Great at grinding up peanuts, dry corn kernels, dry spices and that sort of thing. To clean it, I wash it with a moist cloth as usual and then use a moistened antiseptic towelette (like they use to wipe your skin with prior to giving you an injection) - there's no trace of what I just ground in it once I'm done."
Why is a cup of coffee not 6 oz.?,"Do not blame the coffee makers for what has always been an ambiguous measure - or rather, not a unit for measuring at all. Only in some areas of the world a ""cup"" has evolved into a fixed unit. First and foremost, a cup is a drinking vessel for usually hot beverages and usually with a handle. How big a cup is, is primarily a cultural thing. To showcase two extremes: An espresso cup (source: Wikipedia):  vs. a jumbo coffee mug (source: Amazon) : . I am from Germany. We typically use [ml] for volumetric measurements. Whenever I come across a recipe quoting ""cups"" I start my research: Where did it originate? Is it from the US? I use 245 ml. From current Germany? Probably 200 ml. From my Granny's time? 150 to 180 ml probably fits the bill. Similar rues apply for coffee, from a small espresso or mokka cup in southern Europe or the Arab world to a mug of filtered coffee in the US. There seems to be one correlation though - the ""stronger"" (=more concentrated) a coffee is customarily prepared, the smaller the cup. The amount of ground coffee per ""serving unit"" seems surprisingly constant for the various preparation styles - about a heaping teaspoon per ""cup"". The rest is a matter of taste."
What does the 'strength' mean (in numbers)?,"Coming from Germany myself I have seen this rating only on a single brand of coffee. There is no standard for this (even though us Germans seem to like standardizations), but basically strength of the coffee is about the inherent bitterness and caffeine content you get out of it. The stonger a coffee the more caffeine and also the more bitterness you will usually get."
How should I order an espresso to get a less sour shot?,"Here's a few thoughts based on what causes sourness/acidity in coffee and ways to temper it. Order an espresso lungo. Sourness (acidity) is characteristic of the ""stuff"" that is extracted relatively early in the brewing process. In other brewing methods that take longer to perform (e.g., coffee press, drip, or pour-over) this can be balanced by the more bitter notes that take somewhat longer to fully extract. For this reason, you might get a result that is more appealing to you by ordering an espresso that takes longer to pull, i.e., espresso lungo. Not everyone behind every coffee counter will be immediately familiar with this, but at good cafes with good machines an espresso lungo should be no problem. Try a darker roast. Darker roast coffees tend to be less acidic than lighter roasts, at the expense of losing more of the varietal/regional notes. Many cafes have really only one bean/roast that they use for every espresso (often because of the practical considerations of having several grinder hoppers full of beans), but if you have an option, try a darker-roasted bean. Try beans from a different region. To my taste, Indonesian coffees tend to have less pronounced acidic notes than African or American coffees. Again, if multiple coffees are available for espresso, pick a coffee that you like (or find less sour) for any other preparation. Pick beans further off of the roast. This is really only for completeness, but beans that were very freshly/recently roasted (i.e., less than a few days) can have accentuated acidity because some undesirable volatiles haven't yet had a chance to leach out. This is more toward what @daniel noted; this is the kind of thing you shouldn't need to be concerned about at a cafe -- they should! A cafe affiliated with a local roaster (or any specialty cafe) should be able to tell you lots of things about the coffee when asked, such as region, varietal, roast level, and roast date. Here's a Serious Eats article about ""problems"" and related solutions that touch on some of the things I talked about above. Here's another link from Coffee Cuppers about regional and roast considerations in general."
Bulletproof Coffee: how to blend butter well,"I have been drinking Bulletproof coffee since 2012 now, so made a few of them. Originally I made a BIG mistake of just stirring butter in the coffee with coconut oil or MCT Oil. You can see how horrible the oil slick looked with an old video I did years ago https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rap-spa3RfI What I have found is that you basically need a high speed blender. Vitamix or Blendtec are two brand names Dave has suggested. My wife and I use one called Magimix and it revolutionised how the coffee looks and tastes. So speed is the key. I haven't found a difference by adding the butter or oil in a certain order or way into the blender."
"Should I grind my coffee beans at home, or en masse in the coffee shop?","That's pretty straightforward: if you're not too lazy and have the equipment at hand, always grind only the amound needed just before brewing. Check out this answer for impressive data. Now if your beans are year old already, this might not make a huge difference --- but there's no way that grinding it all at once could help you have ``somewhat fresh cups''."
Is it possible to regrind beans?,"This is a pretty good way to ruin a burr grinder. Worst case scenario, your burrs jam up so much that they can't spin and burn out your motor. A blade could help, but I'd argue that the inconsistent grind you'd get wouldn't be much of an improvement in cup quality anyway. Realistically you'd end up with some of your grinds unchanged, some at the size you want and some ground to dust. The different sized particles would extract unevenly and the dust is likely to clog the filter. That said, you're not going to break a blade grinder by regrinding, so give it a shot and see how you like the results. At most you're out 20-50g of coffee."
"Is it good to have the ""floating oil"" on the surface of some coffee drinks?","The amount of oil in your coffee correlates to what is called the ""body""? This is the ""fullness"" that you feel of the coffee in your mouth. Like the difference between a light cake and fudgey brownie. More oil means more body. You get more body from brewing methods which, like you said, do not use a filter. This includes things like french press. The amount of oil/body is also influenced by the beans you use, with darker roasted coffees generally having more oil/body.  Most people probably wouldn't say a cup of coffee without oil looks any nicer than one with, because there's nothing wrong with it, just a different variety. "
Warm Brew Coffee?,"Well I'm a chemist, but I can't say I'm an expert at scientific coffee extraction; take what I've got to say with a grain of salt. Whenever you are extracting something into water, the temperature plays a couple different roles. First, higher temperatures generally increase the solubility of most compounds. Higher temperature water generally means more of everything gets dissolved, good and bad.Using cold water doesn't entirely solve the problem, since the lower solubility can leave a lot of great flavors behind. Higher temperature can cause the breakdown of proteins, but I would doubt this is a significant source.After all, the beans were already roasted at high temperature before you ever got to the brewing part and the majority of the breakdown probably happened there. I think you've got the right idea with circulating water at some intermediate temperature; you'd probably get the best of both cold and hot brew after you play with the temperatures a bit to find the best one for your tastes. The lower the temperature, the more flavors left behind and the longer you may have to brew to get to an adequate strength. If you do decide to try it, let us know how it works!"
"Milk quantity and consistency in cortado, cappuccino and latte","There's a chart for that! Here's a link to it, but I've also included an image below. There could be some argument over cappuccino vs. latte as to which is ""creamier"" as the cappuccino certainly has more mil foam, but the latte has much more milk by volume and by ratio. On the whole though I'd say the latte is a less strong drink with a creamier texture even if the cappuccino is thicker.  "
How should I clean a stainless coffee carafe?,"Tannin is a chemical contained in coffee and this is what normally stains your coffee making / drinking equipment.  When using an espresso machine it is advised to 'backflush' your machine with cleaning powder which cleans away a build up of 'tannin' from inside the machine. I expect a similar thing has happened to your carafe. With an espresso machine you're advised to do it weekly with heavy use - so I can imagine an ""inadequate cleansed"" carafe would probably be heavily tannin stained. You can purchase tannin cleaning powder from any coffee supplier, such as Happy Donkey.  Even though it is designed for Espresso Machines - it is perfectly safe to dissolve the powder in water and use it to clean other tannin stained equipment."
How long will cold brew keep?,"From anecdotal experience freshness and flavor begins to fade within ~7 days with regular storage methods. Many people brewing cold brew online state between 5 days and 2 weeks is okay to keep cold brew for. In my opinion you will have coffee that you won't want to drink long before you run into harmful bacteria as long as you are keeping things sanitary. How you store the coffee will determine how long it keeps.
To improve storage look into bottling it in individual bottles with little headspace, or even kegging the coffee. Exposing coffee to oxygen will negatively impact flavor and expose coffee to more bacteria. Creating a concentrate of the coffee may help to prevent bacteria from forming. Splitting batches up into multiple sterile containers and keeping them sealed may also help it to last longer.  Getting your coffee to last you a full month is almost definitely going to be much more of a hassle than brewing coffee more frequently. The taste will always be better from fresher coffee and cold brewing coffee is one of the simplest methods. Unless you absolutely can't make coffee more frequently I would recommend making smaller batches you can consume quickly."
How do I use this Indian coffee maker?,"I found a youtube video for this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLwO2ylP6T4 And a post explaining the process: http://www.padhuskitchen.com/2012/05/south-indian-filter-coffee-how-to-make.html So from the above site: Put 3 tbsp of coffee powder in the upper container, fix it on top of the lower container and tap the container gently, so that the powder will settle evenly. Bring water to rolling boil and pour it over the coffee powder. Close it with a lid and leave it undisturbed for 10-15 minutes. The coffee decoction will get collected in the lower container (See picture 3). Boil milk and simmer for a few minutes stirring continuously. Pour needed decoction in a cup and add milk and sugar to taste. If you want it strong, add more decoction, if you prefer mild coffee, add less decoction. Serve hot and frothy in tumbler and davara. Enjoy the aroma and the taste of South Indian filter coffee."
Hario V60 Plastic Dripper vs Ceramic Dripper: Is there any difference in brew quality?,"The main difference between the ceramic and plastic V60 is heat retention. The ceramic will retain heat and can be pre-warmed, creating a stable temperature. Depending on who you are this may not make a huge difference but I prefer the ceramic as I feel the plastic sucks some heat out of the water/coffee. The other reason I prefer ceramic is for cleaning purposes. The ceramic is nonporous and I've used mine for 6 months with no residue or stains whatsoever. The plastic can form build ups from minerals in water or coffee and start to appear visually unappealing (not sure if it will affect flavor of coffee) The plastic V60 is obviously more durable and resistant to bumps and minor drops, so it can be a portable solution for coffee. However the ceramic V60 is the most visually appealing of the V60's (in my opinion) and it stays at my home on the counter so I prefer it. I believe the grooves inside the brewer and the size of everything is identical, so you can't go wrong with any of them. "
"What is the basic differences between espresso, cappuccino, and latte?","I'm going to assume that you've had an espresso. It's a small-cup of coffee extracted under very high pressure. It's delicious by itself and some like to add sugar.  So, what is a latte?
Take a shot of espresso and add steamed milk  What is a cappuccino?
Take a shot of espresso and add steam milk. So, what's the difference between a latte and a cappuccino? Are they the same thing? No. (Unless you're in a really bad diner in which case you shouldn't be ordering lattes there.) There are several differences between a latte and a cappuccino. One is the ratio of milk to espresso. A cappuccino is 1-1 milk to espresso and the latte is 2-1 milk to espresso.  Another difference is that the milk is treated differently. In a latte the milk is heated as opposed to being frothed. In a cappuccino the milk is frothed (converted into a microfoam) to about double it's original volume. (If you've ever heated or foamed milk you'll have noticed how the milk changes state as it's being heated.)  Finally the way the milk and espresso are combined is different. In a latte the heated milk and espresso are poured together into a serving cup. Whatever microfoam might have been created while heating the milk is then poured over the top. In a cappuccino the frothed microfoam is poured over the espresso. It gets more involved than this but I'll let others answer those questions. "
Why must the milk be frothed?,"When heating milk with steam, aerating the milk (the process of drawing in air which creates foam) is essential to allow the milk to heat gently, without scalding. If you're using some other heating process, you'll have to take care of preventing scalding in some (other) way. An extra benefit of foam â particularly microfoam where the bubbles are too small to see â is that it changes the surface tension of the liquid beverage, potentially allowing more taste-buds to come into surface contact. So you get more flavor bio-chemically. As (good) baristas know, tiny bubbles taste better than big ol' soap bubbles. This theory explains why."
How hot should the water be for instant coffee?,"There's an answer to this question at Seasoned Advice: see What water temperature should be used for instant coffee? A brief summary, taken from @PatrickSebastien's answer: Other articles like this one from WikiHow also recommend using filtered water that is just off the boil. See also that same SA answer, and this question, for a discussion and additional context about how instant coffee powder is produced."
Why do coffee packs have an aroma hole if it is recommended to store coffee in an air tight container,"It's actually a one-way valve & it's critical to the shelf life of the coffee and the preservation of the bag itself. When coffee is fresh roasted, it releases carbon dioxide. It's basically a by-product of the roasting process. When the coffee is ground, carbon dioxide is released expeditiously. If you simply place fresh roasted coffee in a completely sealed bag, the bag will expand and in most cases rupture. http://beanfruit.com/blogs/news/15152773-whats-that-thing-on-my-coffee-bag"
How to order Caffe Macchiato and be sure you get one?,"The problem with ordering a ""Macchiato"" is that it's only half of the name of a traditional coffee drink. ""Macchiato"" means ""stained"" or ""flecked"" and not more. In Italy, you have either  If you order a ""Macciato"" without qualifier, you will either get what the chain defines as such (for Starbucks, a lot of milk and foam with one or multiple shots of espresso) or what your barista thinks of first - and that would often be a (latte) macchiato, i.e. a glass of milk and foam with an espresso layer inbetween.  So my recommendation is: If you want a serving of espresso with a bit of milk, order an espresso macchiato. I just double-checked with the Starbucks US website and yes, they do have espresso macchiato on the menu. Any decent barista from the (self proclaimed) high-end places you mention should be familiar with these terms anyway. The fine difference between ""coffee"" and ""caffÃ¨"" (see below) might be ""lost in translation"" and they will be using an espresso machine in 99% of all cases anyway. Comment re. your Wikipedia link: Please note the spelling: caffÃ¨ is not the same as American coffee! The former is what you get when you use a stovetop moka pot, which creates a brew similar (but not identical) to espresso. Both are served in rather small serving units and for coffee drinks used somewhat interchangeably. Espresso shots in a bar or coffee shop, caffÃ¨ often in a domestic setting (no need for fancy machinery)."
What is wrong if my espresso pours out slowly but the first drops shoot out?,"Looks like you've got too much ground coffee in the basket. What's the weight that you're using? It looks like the recommended dose for the stock basket is 14g, which is a bit lower than the ""standard"" of 19g or so. You have an indentation (ring) around the outside of the grounds -- an indentation from the group/dispersion screen (in addition to the notorious protruding center screw on this model). If you're already tamping thoroughly, this could mean you've got too much coffee in there. Here's a thread from Home-Barista on the Silvia around a similar topic. It discusses another way of diagnosing the dose -- inserting the PF with tamped grounds, then removing while still dry.  That article also talks about aiming for a dose+tamp to leave a bit of space between the tamped grounds and the screen: approximately the thickness of a 5-cent piece of space (1-2mm), which is a general recommendation (not just for this machine), though there is certainly disagreement on this. Another article from Serious Eats discusses this topic and notes that a ""sludgy mess"" can result, because the grounds will expand a bit when they absorb water. Your picture also looks a little ""wet""; it could just be the picture, or perhaps a similar symptom. Try a lower dose (14g) and do the dry-removal test, aiming for a bit of space between the top of the tamped grounds and the screen."
What quantity of ground coffee should I use for an automatic drip machine?,"I think you have already listed the ""industry standard"" that is the answer to your question.  It is a good starting point for anyone and the amount can be adjusted by taste afterwards (more grounds for stronger coffee, less for weaker). The amount may vary with brewing method of course, since depending on the method, brew components (grounds, filter, other components) may retain various levels of water.  The one add on I will stipulate is that it is always better (for groups) to brew coffee that is too strong.  It is very easy to add some hot water to a cup and weaken a cup of coffee,  however, if you like strong coffee and it's been brewed weak, you are just out of luck."
How to increase your caffeine sensitivity?,"Over the years I developed a caffeine addiction that reached fairly severe levels.  For background, the addiction ramped into high gear the summer after my freshman year of college (summer of '99) when I was consuming somewhere between 60 and 100 ounces of coffee per day.  I tried to quit cold-turkey once, and spent two weeks mostly bouncing a rubber ball off the wall of my dorm room before I decided the addiction itself wasn't even that bad. Eventually I needed to do something about it, and I went with the only logical method: I slowly backed down my consumption, from about five to seven cups per day at the time to a hard limit of two.  I also forced myself to stop consuming any coffee after about 11:00am. I did all this over a six-week period.  That kept the headaches away, and decreased my dependence on the drug.  However, I had to maintain at that level for several more months -- probably about six or so -- for my sensitivity to caffeine to go back up.  Now, when I drink a cup in the morning, it has the desired effect: it perks me up and prepares me for my day.  It's no longer a crutch, it's simply a pick-me-up I enjoy. In summary: back down your caffeine intake, whatever the delivery method you prefer, by 10 to 20 percent each week until you reach a more manageable level, then hold at that level for several months.  That will increase your sensitivity."
Does adding salt to coffee reduce bitterness?,"The fundamental science seems to be: Sodium salts suppress the perception of bitterness. It specifically mentions caffeine, which is one of the bitter components of coffee. This About article lists a few more references to the same thing: The sodium ion works by ""interfering with the transduction mechanism of [bitterness]."" The point is, it's a change in perception; e.g., the salt is not chemically changing the bitter compounds, just interfering with the bitterness receptors in your tongue. Conversely, the article seems to suggest that the bitterness doesn't reduce the perception of saltiness; this to me suggests that your coffee will taste salty. Caveat emptor! There's a bit more discussion on the saltiness and bitterness sections of the Wikipedia article on taste. This question from Seasoned Advice discusses the same and provides some additional links. The Good Eats article linked from that question is interesting. A search at Seasoned Advice discusses related topics of salt and bitterness.  "
What is the difference between a long (luongo) and a short (ristretto) shot of espresso?,"A long (luongo) and a short (ristretto) shot have two key differences. The amount of coffee used virtually stays the same although it can increase slightly with a ristretto shot, as the grind is finer. The key similarity between these two shots and a normal shot is that the extraction time stays the same. The grind is altered to achieve this - coarser for a long shot and finer for a ristretto shot.  This, ideally, alters the volume of water which can pass through the coffee. For a long shot, the volume should be twice that of a standard espresso shot and for a ristretto shot, the volume should be half that of a standard espresso shot. The temperature of the water remains the same."
Does anyone have experience with this brewing method?,"The biggest drawback is that you might add the grounds to too hot water. Especially avoid adding the coffee to water that is still boiling. Wikipedia has some references about the temperature and it states that boiling water will extract bitterness instead of aromatic oils. So just make sure to wait a moment after taking the water off boil. Second drawback is that since the grounds remain in the pot in contact with the water, you have to empty the pot entirely once the coffee is ""done"". Leaving the grounds in contact with the water for longer times will only add betterness to the coffee. Of course this is no problem if you only make one cup, but prepare to have a (pre-heated) container ready if making more cups. Related to the second drawback is that the extraction will continue in your cup because of the sediment, but in my opinion most people will not even notice it affecting the cup. Coffee oils make it to the news from time to time. Since this coffee is not paper filtered it contains more oils. Some like the taste, some do not. Some link coffee oils to cholesterol levels (I do not..), which might be a personal drawback to some. Offtopic: the method you describe is actually how my granny makes coffee, with a little twist (that I dislike). After adding the grounds, she heats the water to boil again and quickly removes it from the stove after first signs of boiling. Edit: Just wanted to mention that none of the drawbacks I listed is unique to this method."
Can I use filters other than the original Hario filters on my Hario V60?,"Yes. Well, if the shape matches. I have never found alternatives for paper filters (patent restriction?), but there are clothes and stainless steel versions available."
Will coffee taste different from a cup with lid (blocking the smell)?,"Yes.  You should remove the lid for maximum effect.  Somewhere around three quarters of our perception of taste comes from smell.  There are varying figures out there, but most are fairly high.   However, much of that comes from the olfactory sense when the molecules pass from our mouth to our sinuses.  So, having a stuffy nose is more likely to reduce the taste of your coffee than drinking it with the lid on.  That being said, the aroma from brewed coffee tends to dissipate fairly quickly, so you might only need to leave the lid off your cup for the first few minutes of your ""coffee experience"". "
Coffee in a flask - How long can I store?,"There are a few factors at play here. The temperature that the coffee is brewed at and how well the flask holds that temperature are primary. While the coffee stays hot the caffeine level will decrease. The speed will depend on the temperature and the amount of caffeine to start with (which is thoroughly discussed in other questions here). When the coffee cools bacteria growth will start. At what point this bacteria become dangerous not only depends on temperature but also how clean the flask was to begin with and what quality water is being used. Clean tap water in the US, brewing coffee in a very clean french press, and placed into an incredibly clean flask could last two weeks (although it would taste terrible and have little caffeine) but if any of those steps is less than ideal there is a good chance of bacteria growth. Some people's guts will handle that bacteria without a problem, other people may get sick. Edit: I should point out that as I have researched more I'm less certain about the statement regarding caffeine levels over time. Caffeine should not burn at any temperature coffee is left at, and it does not evaporate. So either experiments that say caffeine levels decrease are wrong or the reason it decreases is not clear. Some suggest that bacteria eats the caffeine, which does tie into why it becomes less safe to drink over time."
What factors affect espresso crema?,"From Wikipedia: The ""crema"" is produced by emulsifying the oils in the ground coffee into a colloid, which does not occur in other brewing methods. 
   Personally, I think this definition could use some updating. Crema exists because of the freshness of the coffee, in relation to it's roast. It contains the gasses we find from roasting, such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen gasses. You will notice that if you dig up coffee that is months old and brew it as espresso, there will be little crema. Bottoml ine, if you want crema, you need fresh coffee. The other factor in producing crema, is correct extraction. If you have a poorly extracted shot of espresso, it will be primarily water, with some seriously over-extracted coffee. An even extraction will produce the highest yield of crema."
Is there a difference between cold brewing in the fridge vs room temp?,"Well if you put it into a fridge, all you are doing is slowing down the process. Cold brew is one of the hardest things to mess up if you ask me, so I would just brew it room temperature. If you extend a brew process in time - than you generally have a larger interval of time where the coffee will still taste great, but since it's already hours long I really wouldn't worry about it. All the shops i've ever worked at brew room temperature. Hope this helps!"
Is coffee a pro-oxidant or an antioxidant?,"In Spain one study showed that Brazilian Arabica 100% (A100) roasted samples presented lower antioxidant capacity (less efficient antioxidants) than Robusta coffee varieties (could be due to the higher percentage of chlorogenic acids in Robusta ground coffee than in Arabica) therefore Brazilian Arabica 100% (A100) presented the highest value of pro-oxidant activity. However higher antioxidant activity was observed in Colombian coffees than in conventional roasted coffee blends. On the other hand, when the percentage of torrefacto coffee was increased, an increase of the antioxidant activity and a slight tendency to decrease the pro-oxidant activity were observed. Therefore addition of sugar at the end of the torrefacto roasting process may influence the antioxidant and pro-oxidant properties of coffee because sugar is one of the main precursors the Maillard reaction. In summary, we can say that antioxidant and pro-oxidant capacity of ground coffee can be affected by several factors such as coffee variety, roasting process (e.g. torrefacto), growing climate, storage, etc. The details of the studies for further reading can be found below.

"How can I maximize the time the ""high"" lasts?","Without considering the amount or potency of the coffee as well as setting personal metabolism aside, you could adjust your coffee schedule according to your natural circadian rhythm, a methodology neuroscientist Steve Miller refers to as chronopharmacology.  Essentially, you use the caffeine as a propellant to your natural ""up"" rhythm. Gabrielle Taylor's article does a fine job of explaining this: When you drink coffee during the time when your body is already releasing cortisol, it won't have as strong an effect. Ideally, you want to get your caffeine during the lulls between cortisol spikesâotherwise, you start to develop a tolerance and have to drink more to get the same effect. Assuming you're on a regular sleep schedule, your cortisol levels naturally spike about an hour after you wake up. If you get up at 7 am, your body is naturally most awake between 8 and 9 in the morning, noon to 1 pm, and again around 5:30-6:30 pm. So, based on a wake time of 7 am, the best times to drink your caffeine vehicle of choice are 9:30-11:30 am and 1:30-5:00 pm. Obviously you can adjust the schedule according to your own wake time if it's earlier or later."
Kopi Luwak - real or not?,"I actually might say no. This type of coffee is rather expensive at $100 to $600 per US pound. Yes, 100 to 600 USD. This is natural Kopi Luwak coffee at a normal price. The word blend sounds a little fishy to me, as it usually means that it is not entirely pure Kopi Luwak. The thing is, it's really up to you to decide for yourself. If you can trust them, buy it. If you think the product isn't what you want, don't buy it. I will probably say no, but you make the final decision. Go with your gut and say yes or no to buying that product. Good luck!"
Storing cream in my office,"Companies (including Nestle) make creamers that do not require refrigeration.  They are likely available in your local grocer, you just need to check the label and make sure refrigeration isn't required.   If you are paranoid about potential bacterial growth or contamination (like me) you may check into bulk buying the single serving creamers that they use at restaurants.  They require no refrigeration either and are sealed until use. If you are looking to keep ""real cream"" cold for 8 to 10 hours, you may want to look into some sort of freezable lunch bag or small ice chest that will stay cold and takes up less space than a mini-fridge.  This would require substantially more effort, but may be worth it if you are particular about your cream.  Also from the comments below, you may look into a double wall vacuum thermos.  They are increasingly popular and come in a wide variety of qualities and prices, so do your research before buying."
"How do I brew french roast coffee, so that it doesn't taste like ash","Starbucks' dark roasts are very dark. It tastes like ash because it contains ash. There's no way around that. That said, you can minimize the ashy notes in your brew by using the below suggestions: Lower the brew temperature--cold brew in particular works well for this purpose Use a coarser grind setting when grinding If using a hot brew method, reduce the time you let the coffee brew Use just the first or some combination of all three. It'll take experimentation to get it right."

How to (re-)calibrate an espresso machine and grinder setup?,"This answer addresses a ""standard"" semi-automatic espresso machine with a separate grinder. Specifically the LaMarzocco and Astoria grinder, but the ideas should generalize to other machines of the same class. Of course, wipe down everything and get all pitchers and spoons clean. Blast out all the milk and ""wetness"" from the steam wands. Inspect and clean all portafilters* (get one clean, and then use it while you clean the others), and if necessary backflush the groups with water (with ""bumping"" so you blast water around the seals to get any buildup there clean). *especially under the basket. The abstract procedure here is described using the Hackers' terms Frob, Twiddle, and Tweak. 
http://catb.org/esr/jargon/html/F/frob.html To fully calibrate the setup, we'll need to make three passes over all the controls. The controls we have available are the grind, dose, and water quantity. Following the David Schomer method, I strongly advise that the tamping pressure should be constant. Always tamp the same way: from the elbow, so you don't stress your wrists. In the David Schomer method, the dose is controlled by counting ""clicks"" of the doser. You keep the doser compartment as empty as possible, grinding only what you need so everything stays fresh, locked in the bean). Count how many clicks gets you to ""full"", maybe a little heaping. This number is your base dose. Keep it constant for now. And this constitutes the ""frob"" of the dose. Set the group in programming mode and Pull a shot, setting the water level to yield 2 oz. This is the ""frob"" of the water quantity. If the extraction time was off, adjust the grind. This the ""frob"" of the grind, so you can make bigger movements if you need to (exercise your judgement), but remember only adjust finer while grinding, so you don't lock the burrs on a tough bean. Pull a few shots until the time is (roughly) correct. So, we've done our ""frob"" pass. Now ""twiddle."" Adjusting the grind to control the extraction time probably threw off the water quantity a little bit. So do a ""twiddle"" of the water quantity by entering programming mode and pulling a shot. Actually, you shouldn't need to ""twiddle"" per se: there's no *up and down"" here, but I think the terms still represent a useful mnemonic for the general procedure. Then do a ""twiddle"" of the grind. You want the grind to be as coarse as possible within its ""range"", if you know what I mean. All the grounds in the doser are quickly going stale. A coarser grind yields little pieces of coffee bean that are slightly larger, with a lower surface/volume ratio. Lower surface area means less interaction with the air, and the grounds resist going stale a little better. There should be no need to ""twiddle"" the dose at this point. We're adjusting the other controls so the dose remains at comfortable spot. Now, one final pass to ""tweak"". Pull a shot, and examine its quality. Particularly look for the tell-tale white ""overextraction stain"" where the last drips struck the crema. You want to tweak the water quantity to stop just before the color changes. This tweak gives you ""ristretto-quality"" shots. Remember that we did not mess with the dose much in the above steps. But the other parameters were setup so the dose is ""comfortable"". This lets us make small adjustments to the dose in order to ""ride the wave"" of the machine and keep all the shots in the time range. Remember not to brew shots while the boiler is cycling. The same three adjustments, frob, twiddle, and tweak, apply also to dynamic adjustments. Frob, the coarsest control is the water quantity, which should no longer need adjusting at this point. Twiddle, the medium-grain control is the grind setting. Unless a freak thundershower rolls-in and totally changes the pressure and humidity of the atmosphere, you should only need to make small adjustments and only to recalibrate the dose to a comfortable level. Tweak, the finest control is the dose. If a shot pulls 1-second too long, tweak your dose ever-so-slightly shorter. Either count 1-fewer click, or count your clicks just a hair faster. If a shot pulls 1-second too short, tweak your dose ever-so-slightly longer. Either count 1 more click, or count your clicks just a hair slower. If the dose gets too low (by visual inspection: exercise your judgement), twiddle the grind a little coarser so you can achieve the same density with more mass. If the dose gets too high (exercise judgement), twiddle the grind a little finer so you can achieve the density with less mass. (Volume is constant.) I actually haven't worked on this machine in almost 10 years. So this is all based on my memory of that one amazing day when I pulled 20sec (+/-1) shots for eight solid hours. On a different day, I recalibrated after a thunderstorm started by pulling the grinder 8 clicks (!) coarser. And got it back to 20sec after 2 or 3 pairs. That's how I know. But I learned this all from David Schomer's book. -- This is what I remember from the amazing book, Espresso Coffee: Professional techniques by David Schomer. And hey Matt, I want my copy back! Pull an ounce or so of water through the old spent puck to heat the group. Yank the portafilter and knock the old puck into the compost bin. Wipe the basket and run a splash of water through the group without the portafilter to rinse the upper screen. (You can catch this water with the portafilter before wiping to rinse more of the grounds so your clean towel stays clean longer.) Turn on grinder to start to fill the doser (which should be as empty as practical). Immediately start pulling clicks of the doser until the basket is full, or a little heaping. Turn off grinder. With clean hands, distribute the grounds evenly with a finger (I use my ring finger, but whatever works). Tamp lightly to shape the puck. Tap the edge with the handle end of your nice aluminum tamper that you bought yourself and brought to work to help. This gets the little bit of coffee around the edge that the tamper missed. Tamp firmly, from the elbow. About 30 pounds of pressure. Reinsert the portafiler. Click the button to start brewing. Immediately discard the hot water from the shot glasses which is still there from step A.1. Watch the pour and stop it early if you need to, to catch the sweet spot. And finally, I apologize for my excessive use of emphatic ""quotation marks""."
How to prepare good coffee during an outdoor trip?,"I'm going to focus on the ""old-school"" aspect of your question. From my perspective/experience, the classic way of producing ""camp coffee"" is a percolator. To use this device, you put grounds in a basket on the top, water in the bottom, assemble the apparatus, and put it over a heat source (e.g., camp fire, stove, etc.). If you want a stronger brew (as it sounds like you do), you can also use a moka pot (some call this a ""stovetop espresso maker"", though I don't care for that term) -- there are some very compact moka pots like this one that are targeted for backpacking/camping. This will give you very good moka-pot-strong espresso-like coffee, but you won't mistake it for espresso out of a professional espresso machine. You get the full experience of brewing a pot of coffee in the wilderness, which I enjoy. See also my related q/a on the difference between a percolator and a moka pot. Those are my preferences for camp coffee. For a little more technology, you can use integrated heater/container systems like the JetBoil; they also have small accessories like this French press insert so you can minimize the extra gear (e.g., you can use the setup for heating water for other cooking, and (separately) use it to make coffee). On the extreme end of low-weight and low-technology spectrum, you could use instant coffee or try coffee bags such as these, which are like tea bags, except that they are filled with coffee. You could even make your own coffee-bags (see instructables and MtBoE). Though there are tradeoffs and reasons you might not want to do this, from Seasoned Advice. These single-serve coffee bags have the advantage of minimal clean-up, and the whole package may be compostable. Also you don't have to worry about hot gear if you're packing up to get on the trail quickly (e.g., backpacking). Bags and instant are passable, ultra-light substitutes for actual coffee that get the job done but are less enjoyable to drink (for me). Storage of beans and/or grounds is tricky -- especially already-ground coffee goes stale very quickly. You can minimize the damage by keeping everything sealed and dry. See also questions about storage in general and vacuum-sealing. You could always use a hand grinder, but that's more gear and more weight. In sum: I go ""fast and light"" for coffee on the trail: gear that's reasonably light, that I can use quickly (for me, this is moka pot) so I can get the caffeine-dose done and get back on the trail. Pre-grind the coffee into a zip-top bag and evacuate as much air as possible. Deal with the slightly-stale taste and focus on being outdoors!"
How long can I store ground coffee in the fridge?,"Coffee should never be stored in the fridge! In the same way that baking soda absorbs smells, coffee will absorb smells and flavors in your refrigerator. These compounds can be extracted when you brew your coffee and will contribute to undesired flavors. Proper storage of coffee is to put your beans into an airtight container, and store around 25C out of sunlight (EX: your cabinet). "
What coffee and roast are best for tiramisu?,"From a cooks perspective, I think it should be ""espresso"", or ""caffÃ¨"" not ""coffee"" in any good tiramisu recipe, which in turn would already suggest a type of beans and roast.  Note that the Italian term caffÃ¨ denotes the strong black liquid you get from an esspesso machine or a moka.  The coffee in a tiramisu has to be concentrated to supply enough flavour without soaking the ladyfingers or other bisquits used. (The same principle applies when you use a liquor.) When choosing the beans /the roast, the same rule as for wine applies: Use what you drink. And seriously, unless you are making an insane amount of tiramisu, you will be using only very little of one pack of coffee.
I use whatever I choose for my Espresso (if I feel rich, I'll splurge on something from my local roaster, in a pinch the usual suspects like Illy or Lavazza, sometimes even a Starbucks Espresso roast cough) and call it a day. So in sort, get a classic Italian espresso roast, prepare it authentically and you should be fine. In a pinch, use another coffee, but make sure it is very strong. You'll need a few tablespoons tops for a standard tiramisu recipe."
Steam-Powered Espresso Machine: Crema?,"There are a few reasons why you might not get a good crema: With a steam-powered espresso machine (especially if it's an entry level machine), you will typically not reach high enough pressure to get a proper crema. The crema is formed by oils extracted from the ground coffee, which needs high pressure (something like 9 bars). Your steam-powered machine will probably not produce more than ~3 bars of pressure. Tamping with a spoon also seems not ideal, because it will be very difficult to achieve an even tamp. I cannot comment on how important that is for this particular machine, but with higher end pump machines it might lead to channeling and uneven extraction."
"Is there a ""caffeine metabolism curve"", understood by general public?","Most medications approved by the FDA and used in a medical setting have such statistics.  Caffeine is no exception.  Most drug databases have listed pharmacokinetics for caffeine.  Onset is listed as 15 to 45 minutes with peak concentrations as 30 minutes in adults.  Half life for caffeine varies based on a number of factors.  For adults it is listed as 4 to 5 hours, however, studies suggest it is generally less for smokers.  It is much much longer for infants (52 to 96 hours) but generally by nine months of age, those numbers have dropped to similar levels seen in adults.  "
Why do barista's keep activating the doser whilst grinding coffee,"Short reason: Tradition conflicting with modern brewing practices. Long reason: This is more a result of an industry-wide legacy when purchasing equipment, where coffee shop owners will pick up mechanically dosed grinders instead of doserless, or electrically metered models because ""that's how it's been done,"" or because the technology simply wasn't  affordable until simple microcontrollers became cheap.  Traditionally, you would grind enough coffee to fill the doser, dispensing grounds for brewing as needed and refilling the doser when the level dropped too low.  Dosers exist to allow for predictably size quantities of grounds to be dispensed into the portafilter, and that's basically it.   This, however, conflicts with the ""Third Wave"" coffee culture, where flavor and texture are paramount.  In this new culture, coffee beans are ground for immediate use, rather than drawing from a bin.  The moment beans are ground, the gasses contained within (gasses that are the reason Crema exist) are allowed every opportunity to escape.  The longer they sit, the less gasses will be left behind by the time they're used to brew.   So when a Third Wave coffee shop grinds using a doser, the Barista rapid-fires the dosing lever, essentially moving the coffee straight into the portafilter. A better plan is just to use a direct-dosing grinder where the grounds are metered by time or weight straight into the filter.  Advances in the packaging options for load cell sensors and simple controllers have made this somewhat common in both consumer and commercial equipment."
What's the theory behind using thin spouted kettles when making drip/pour over coffee,"By having a thin spout, you can more finely control the flow rate and where the water lands.    When making pour-over coffee, you want to control the water level in the cone to control the brew time and evenly extract coffee.  Also, water needs to be poured carefully onto the middle of the cone so that the water doesn't run down the side of the cone without touching the coffee grounds."
My moka pot brew exploded. What did I do wrong?,"While the grind could have been too fine, I suspect what happened is you overfilled the bottom chamber, and the water level was covering the safety valve. You really don't want the water level to go higher than the red line in the image below. "
What is white coffee?,"As suggested by several previous comments, there's several things that could be called ""white coffee.""  According to the white coffee article on Wikipedia, and other sources (e.g., coffeefaq, NescafÃ©); others listed below. I hope this is a reasonable (albeit, perhaps not acutely helpful) summary."
What factors determine coffee bean size?,"The single biggest factor in the size of a coffee bean is the botanical variety of the plant. There is no amount of nutrition or growing conditions that can overcome the effect of genetics.   In this picture from our garden at Coffea Diversa you can see two examples at the extreme.  On one hand you have mokka, this variety has the smallest bean of all
coffee varieties.  On the other hand you have Maragogype, this variety has the largest
bean of all coffee varieties. There is no amount of fertilizer that you can give to a mokka grain to make it even come close to the size of a ripe Maragogype bean (and viceversa).  The difference in sizes between your blend and peruvian coffees are probably due to the botanical varieties of the beans.   "
Optimizing the office pot,Three quick and easy hacks you can do without throwing capitol at the issue:
How can I achieve a very bitter flavor using the French press?,"Bitterness comes from over-extracting the coffee. The factors affecting extraction are: water temperature, time, size of the grind, and to a lesser extent, agitation. Using hotter water (above the usual 198F-202F), longer steep time, or a finer grind--or any combination of the three--will result in over-extraction, which will make the coffee more bitter. A darker roast will over-extract more easily as well, since an ideal extraction is typically 30-45 seconds shorter than a light roast."
How long should I steep an AeroPress (inverted)?,"I typically aim to finish plunging at 2:30, using a fine grind and 200F water. But I'm always experimenting when it comes to the Aeropress, and would probably have a different answer in a month. I found it helpful when I first started with the Aeropress to try out some of the recipes from the World Aeropress Championships."
Roughly how much caffeine am I ingesting when I eat chocolate coffee beans?,"This seems to suggest that there is approximately 7mg of caffeine per coated bean.  I've no idea how much those weight per piece, or how many are in a bag, but the math should be fairly easy if you have access to such things. I found another manufacturer of a similar product which claims 40g for 28 pieces. Extrapolating that for your 150g bags gives roughly 700mg of caffeine, which sounds like way too much.  This could very greatly of course between manufacturers depending on chocolate thickness/weight."
How hot should water be to brew ground coffee directly in a cup?,"Your method most closely resembles Turkish Coffee, which is suggested to be served at hot, but not boiling temperatures. Since the exposure to the grounds is so direct, it's easy to burn the coffee at boiling temperatures. You want a full body, but not a burnt taste (yuck!) Turkish Coffee World recommends about 158 degrees Fahrenheit or 70 degrees Celsius."
Why is coffee comforting,"A 2008 U. Colorado (Boulder) study*, suggests that merely holding warm drinks (vs. cold) can positively influence perception of people.  There is apparently some connection between the physical act of holding a warm drink and one's perception of the outside world. The association of warm beverages and positive feelings may underlie the sensation of relaxation as well, although I didn't find a study on precisely on point.  Whether the effect is physiological or psychological the authors weren't sure.      *Experiencing Physical Warmth Promotes Interpersonal Warmth, Science, 322: 606-607 (2008) Williams and Bargh."
Beans for Qatar-type coffee?,"I can read Arabic and also I prepare Arabian coffee as you want, so here comes the recipe  1- you have to get a very fine ground, light roasted plain coffee 1 tps / 80 ml water 2- ground cardamom 1/8 tps 3- saffron 4- 1:2 cloves / 80 ml 5- rose water 1/2 tps / 80 ml A lot of Arabs drink it plain. Instead of sugar they eat dates along with it but you can add sugar if you wish; set your pot on a very very low heat, let it boil. Turn the heat off and transfer it to another pot, wait until the grounds settle down the pot and pour, have fun."
What causes the crema in my latte to appear so charred?,"Hard to diagnose just on the back of a photo, but if I had to guess, I'd say the milk is not ""sunk"" properly (i.e. the consistency of your espresso is different to that of the milk). This would also explain why the base of the rosetta is a bit ""murky"". That took me a while to figure out, but I had the same issue (check this out, then compare to this). So in practical terms, avoid wiggling the pitcher before a white ""dot"" appears on the surface. Only once the white dot appears on the surface and the stream of milk coming from the pitcher has pushed it further into the cup, should you start rocking the pitcher left to right (good examplehere albeit a different pattern). Hope this helps! "
Are there any ways that coffee consumers can measure the caffeine content of what they are drinking by themselves?,"It really depends on your budget. You say you are fine with a bit of an investment - how does 2500$ sound? For that price you can get a Lighttells CA-700 which lets you analyze the caffeine content in your coffee. It may sound expensive but compared to the other caffeine testing equipment out there it's relatively cheap. Depending on how far down the coffee rabbit hole you are, you may have heard of James Hoffmann - he recently made a video about exactly what you are trying to achieve. I'm afraid this is currently the cheapest method to get reliable, repeatable and somewhat precise results in measuring caffeine content."
"What is a cafÃ© allongÃ©, and how is it pronounced?","CafÃ© allongÃ© is the French for Italian cafe lungo, or in English, long espresso. There may be previous related answers on this: I don't know how to write in the pronounciation alphabet, but it is pronounced something similar to ""a-lawn-jee"". Normally, it is prepared in a bit longer time than normal espresso. So, the second explanation given in the book is the standard way. The first one is more sophisticated and uncommon with many side flavors in it. People who are into coffee mostly prefer pure coffee. However, as the author likes it that way, probably he uses such a metaphor in his book. (As computer scientists know, JavaScript is dynamically typed which may cause many undesirable side effects according to the type theory. I assume, the second recipe is more suitable to be used as a metaphor for a programming language that has type system. Haskell maybe?)"
How to order cappuccino without whipped cream in France?,"You probably just hit upon a place that simply didn't know what a cappuccino was, or lacked the facilities to prepare one. French coffee culture is a little different from Italian, but usually a cappuccino is much like what you'd expect. I found this exhaustive guide to French coffee culture, and it notes: Capuccino â A French cappuccino is thirty per cent espresso coffee, fifty per cent milk, twenty per cent froth and no whipped cream. If the cafe you are in adds whipped cream then you must be in a cafe catering to tourists. So it sounds like you just had bad luck!"
How much caffeine is lost after 24 hours?,"Caffeine does not break down (at any appreciable rate) when left alone in a drink. It requires the enzymes in your body to break it down, so when you take the drink out of the fridge, it'll be just as caffeinated as when you put it in. However, your drink will still be stale, because there are plenty of other organic compounds in the coffee that will break down over that time, affecting the taste. Also, assuming you reheat the coffee, the reheating will have further effects, making it taste very bitter. Either make yourself a smaller coffee (16oz is a lot!) or drink it all when it's fresh."
What do the terms extraction and strength mean?,"Though I don't generally like to cite Wikipedia as my primary reference, it does in this case have a pretty good overview of terms related to coffee extraction, re-summarized here: Extraction:
The amount of the original mass of the grounds that ends up in the brewed coffee. Though it certainly depends on the preparation method (""method of extraction"", e.g., drip, moka, espresso, cold-brew, ...), the recommended extraction amount is about 20% (i.e., about 20% of the mass of the beans/grounds ends up in the brewed coffee).  Less than ~15%-18% extraction is considered ""under-extracted"" and can be sour. That is, under-extraction is not just a matter of inefficiency: the result can be sour and unbalanced due to the fact that acids are extracted quickly. On the other hand, more than ~22%-25% extraction is considered ""over-extracted"" and can be bitter, because the bitter compounds are extracted later in the brewing process.   These figures were generated by groups with lofty-sounding names like the Specialty Coffee Association of America, the Coffee Brewing Institute, and the Italian Espresso National Institute. Also known as ""solubles yield."" See also this article on espresso extraction. Strength:
The concentration of the extracted compounds in the water. Basically, how much coffee is in the water per unit (volume or mass). As noted in the question, there are also colloquial or vernacular uses of these terms (e.g., ""strength"" as relative flavour profile; ""extraction"" as the process of brewing, etc.) but the above seem to be the accepted tangible definitions of the terms."
How do I backflush my espresso machine?,"Backflushing is a fairly straightforward procedure. You only need two things: The procedure needs repeating a few times (3-4): After you've done this, repeat the procedure without detergent to flush the soap suds from the machine. Normally you would do this about once a month. This is highly dependant on how you feel the machine is doing, but it's definitely recommended that you do this if you use the machine a lot (Some people recommend doing it around every 30th espresso). After this it is a good idea to run one espresso shot through the machine to clear everything out and not leave any residue. You can find further details here"
Coffee and the singing voice,"Caffein, which is the main active ingredient in coffee is known to be dehydrating. However there is no conclusive scientific evidence that caffein intake in normal dosages has detrimental effects on the quality of your voice. One study by Akthar et al. (1999) showed that the ingestion of 250mg of caffein, which corresponds to 2 to 3 cups of coffee, produced alteration in the voice of 8 individuals. I would take this result with a grain of salt though, since a study performed with only 8 subjects, without control group or anything, can hardly be called representative or conclusive in any way. Also they say that the effect produced varied substantially between individuals. Another study by Franca et al. (2013) is showing that the ingestion of 100mg of caffein shortly before using your voice does not have any negative effect on the quality of your voice. I think this is a more plausible study design, 100mg corresponds to a cup of coffee and the experiment is controlled with one group taking placebos. Finally a recent review (Alves et al. 2017) of the literature on dehydration and vocal quality found that dehydration is, surprise, bad for your voice. They also found however that ""systematic hydration is the easiest [...] solution to improve voice quality"". Thus I would conclude, that as long as you take care to stay hydrated, meaning drinking water with your coffee (which everyone should do in any case) moderate amounts of coffee consumption will likely not have any detrimental effect on your voice quality. The evidence for that seems to be mainly anecdotal and not scientific. If you struggle with some vocal chord disease for example or you are in recovery of one, maybe coffee could be ill-advised. Akthar et al. (1999) hint to something like that. There's no proof that it's damaging in those cases either, but just for the sake of being overly careful rather than ending up doing damage (anyways it would likely be only temporary) to your voice, if you are professionally dependent on it, maybe restrain from coffee consumption in cases of diseases etc. References: Akhtar, S., Wood, G., Rubin, J., O'Flynn, P., & Ratcliffe, P. (1999). Effect of caffeine on the vocal folds: A pilot study.

How long can I keep my carafe on the warmer?,"It would depend on a number or factors including temperature of the warmer and humidity in the room.  However, personally, I can begin to taste a difference after as little as 45 minutes on the warmer.  I tend to drink two cups of coffee pretty quickly to avoid this.   Coffee is a product always best fresh, but how long before your palate can detect that it isn't fresh any longer is a matter that varies by individual.  My wife will drink coffee from a pot that has been sitting for four hours plus; after about an hour and a half I'll throw the pot away and make another.  Your own mileage may vary."
Is my new Baratza Virtuoso producing too many fines?,"Burr grinders (that aren't of a very high or industrial quality) generally do not produce even grinds. I usually recommend a spinning blade grinder to the home barista for this reason. You indicated that you will be using a drip machine with a paper filter. In my opinion, based on what I can see in the picture where the machine has been broken in, I think that these grinds are fine for a paper filter drip machine. There are a decent number of fine grinds, but I think it's alright for your purposes. If you plan to use another type of machine though, it may not be. If you were using an espresso machine or a french press, you would have problems here (which I will not get into here). This might even be true for a permanent filter drip machine. If you know that you are only going to use this for paper filter drip coffee, keep it. It seems to be pretty good for this purpose. If you ever want to branch out into espresso or french press coffee, I recommend returning it and getting a better one. Remember it all comes down to you and taste. If you are satisfied with the taste of the coffee, then be happy with your grinder. If you aren't, or want to get as close to perfection as possible, then consider something else."
Could preparation method make coffee more acidic?,"This is a perfect follow up to the ""What coffees are the least acidic?"" question!  As always, Lets answer it with some data! My company uses machine learning, data science, and sensory science to build flavor profiling and quality control tools for the craft beverage industry.  TL;DR: Yes. Preparation has a significant affect on the flavor profile of coffee - including the level of acidity.   If I may present to you... the distribution of acidity in coffee by brewing method! 
Clearly and without surprise, Espresso (coffee extracted under pressure) is the most acidic preparation method, on average. French Press (full immersion brewing) is the least acidic, and V60 (a type of pour-over) has the widest range. But is there something else going on here? 
What if there exists a conflating factor such as green processing, roast level, or growing environment? Some of these questions we're already answered in the link above, so lets focused on the remaining question - how does the origin of the coffee effect the perceived acidity of the coffee by brewing method?   So is the effect of brewing method consistent? No. 
What we're seeing here is that each continent tends towards a different green processing technique, and thus a different optimal level of roast - all of which exert as much influence over the resulting level of acidity in the flavor profile of the coffee.  Oh... you should have just said so....   This is a conditional inference tree mapping the distribution of acidity scores to a series of categorical variables.  Country is clearly the most used variable in creating this tree, and interestingly, Green Processing is only used as a splitting rule when a country has a variety of green processing methods in common use.  Please leave a comment if you'd like me to add a variable or further analysis to this answer! "
How to weaken effects of caffeine after consumption,"What you experienced was a caffeine overdose, however mild, and that's something that you shouldn't really try home remedies to correct. Had you gone to the emergency room, you probably could have expected to been given a laxative, activated charcoal, and possibly I.V. fluids. I doubt that they would have pumped your stomach over a single cup, but they might have if your heart was beating irregularly.  Absorption of most things you swallow generally depends on how much you've had to eat - so yes, eating something filling (e.g. bread soaked in water) would probably have alleviated some of the discomfort, especially if you had the coffee on an empty stomach. Staying hydrated (but not over-hydrated) would also have been important.  I wouldn't advise self-medicating in circumstances like this, all you can do is be very mindful of symptoms getting worse (particularly any sign of irregular heart activity) while you wait it out and (eventually) crash into bed.  But, bread / crackers / water - not going to hurt, and might make you feel a little better, or better sooner. While symptomatic, I wouldn't take anything over the counter or prescription unless you checked with a doctor (because of possible heart implications) And really, if you feel at all beyond 'blaugh' - you should see a doctor quickly. People die from too much caffeine, and it's not pretty, so be careful."
Is it necessary to allow a shot of espresso to rest before adding it to a drink?,"Not necessary in my opinion.  In fact, i prefer to add it as soon as possible.  The activity you describe is the crema dissipating.  I prefer a lot of crema...  if you wait 30 seconds, there should still be decent crema integrity.  By the way, Starbucks trains their baristas to add the shot within 10 seconds of brewing."
Avoid clumps in finely ground coffee,"I wouldn't go so far as to say that it's not a very high-quality grinder, it does extremely well for the price. The clumping is an artifact of: Grinders that produce almost no heat while grinding, to the point that they do it reliably enough for it to be a listed feature cost ten times the amount that you paid for your grinder. Heat during grind isn't an indication of a low-quality grinder, rather, little to no heat is simply an indicator of a very high-quality grinder. There isn't much you can do about this other than purchase a manual burr grinder and grind by hand very gingerly, which takes lots of time. Tamping alone should be sufficient to deal with any clumps (at approximately 15kg of force) - if it's not, then you want to take a very close look at the beans you're using, and the level of humidity they're exposed to in storage. Is your grinder normally close to anything that produces steam? Is your kitchen air really humid? Are the beans stored in air-tight containers? If you have clumps that tamping won't take care of, you probably have a moisture problem. It can also be the bean, some roasts just do not do well for espresso, no matter how fine the grind or how dry the storage.  Both Lavazza and Illy produce a very pleasant medium arabica bean that should work very well in your grinder. They are very consistent in production, delicious, and should give you a good baseline to select other beans that would work similarly well. You can get beans that weren't specifically produced with espresso in mind to work, but it takes a bit of tinkering. I recommend the above beans very often to people just getting started because they're delicious and very easy to work with. Anyway, try one of those, see what comes out of the grinder. If you're still getting clumps that don't immediately break down when you tamp (tap the portafilter on the sides a few times before you tamp to help this) you could try cleaning the grinder, changing how you store the beans, or looking at a de-humidifier in the area that you keep them. "
How does freezing affect vacuum packed coffee beans?,"Freezing will not affect the coffee beans chemically. Thawing may affect them though. When you thaw the beans, small amounts of water (that were frozen as small amounts of air humidity) will melt and it may collect together and cause some very small extractions in the bean. This is probably quite minimal due to the fact that you have vacuum packed the beans though. This is generally undesirable but it is up to you whether or not you want to do this. If you do indeed freeze them, make sure that you let them thaw completely before opening the package. Do not open the package until they are back to room temperature. This is so that the humidity can stabilize inside. If you open the package earlier, moisture from the air may condense onto the beans, causing a small amount of extraction.  In terms of how long they will last in the freezer? I am unsure of this as I have never frozen my beans as it is not recommended."
How can I improve this Chemex cold brew method?,"What you're talking about is the ""Japanese iced coffee"" method, which is hot-water brew directly over ice. In contrast, cold-brew is using cold water in contact with the grounds. See techniques at other questions tagged as cold-brew. This article from Counter Culture, also referenced in the article you linked, suggest Japanese iced as an alternative to cold brew. The articles suggest that directly brewing hot coffee over ice retains more of the volatile flavour compounds. If you have had true cold-brew before, most methods use several times as much coffee grounds to brew as with other methods (some then dilute this with, e.g., water or milk). For example, normalized to a 200mL ""cup"" (~6.5 fl.oz.) of brewed coffee: Blue Bottle suggests about 3x more coffee for cold brew (45g per 200mL) than for drip (14g per 200mL). If you're coming from that strength, it's no wonder you're finding it watery.  To your first question: If you want a stronger brew, why not simply use more coffee grounds? Your amount (21g grounds to 300g water+ice is about 14g/200mL cup) is already at the higher end of the spectrum for drip coffee; the industry standard is closer to 7g per cup/dose. But if you want it stronger, use more beans! On your other question: this temperature change shouldn't be an issue. You said you're using a Chemex (e.g., classic 3-cup) -- it is made from Pyrex brand borosilicate glass, which has very good thermal shock properties. Even a lesser glass (e.g., non-tempered soda-lime glass) shouldn't be a problem at these temperatures (slowly dripping boiling water onto ice). (However, for example, ice into glass at oven temperatures could certainly be a problem)."
Why does coffee heal headaches in some people but causes it in others?,"Different people react to chemicals and stimulants in slightly different manners.  It's entirely possible that the raise in blood pressure caused by caffeine may be exaggerated in some individuals (especially those who are caffeine naive) and cause headaches.   On the other hand, caffeine may reduce or prevent headaches in other individuals through several mechanisms: Caffeine is also a common ingredient in many medications used for
  treating migraines, due to the fact that it makes analgesics work more
  efficiently, causes a faster absorption, and allows for a reduced
  dosage which decreases possible side effects of certain analgesics. It's also possible for people who are caffeine addicted (daily coffee drinkers) to begin withdrawal symptoms if they don't get caffeine/coffee.  One of these symptoms may be headache.  Consuming caffeine again can alleviate these withdrawal symptoms."
What changes need to be made to espresso machine so it can function properly in space?,"I was able to dig up this press release:
http://www.lavazza.com/en/.content/document/pdf/PR_Italian-espresso-in-orbit.pdf The first capsule-based espresso system able to work in the extreme
conditions of space is here. It is called ISSpresso and is the
brainchild of two Italian companies â Argotec and Lavazza â in
collaboration with the Italian Space Agency Turin, 13 June 2014 â âAn espresso coffee is what I miss most aboard
the International Space Station.â We have repeatedly heard this
comment from the Italian astronauts who for 13 years have been at
times working in the International Space Station, and today their
espresso wish is about to become reality. In fact, Argotec and Lavazza
are working together with the Italian Space Agency (ISA) to actually
bring the authentic Italian espresso onto the International Space
Station. So in the Futura Mission â the second long-term mission of
the Italian Space Agency aboard the Space Station â another Italian
astronaut of the European Space Agency, Air Force Captain Samantha
Cristoforetti, could not only be the first Italian woman to go into
space, but also the first astronaut in history to drink an authentic
Italian espresso in orbit. Its name is ISSpresso. It takes its name from the International Space
Station (ISS), where it is to be installed. It is the first
capsule-based espresso system able to work in the extreme conditions
of space, where the principles that regulate the fluid dynamics of
liquids and mixtures are very different from those typical on Earth.
ISSpresso is the product of a project run by Argotec, the Italian
engineering company specialised in the design of aerospace systems and
European leader in the preparation of healthy and nutritious foods for
in-space consumption, and Lavazza, the historic Italian coffee brand.
ISSpresso is a veritable technological and engineering jewel, able to
deliver a perfect espresso in weightless environment. This is why it
was selected by the Italian Space Agency to be used aboard the ISS, in
the framework of the Request for Expression of Interest that the
Agency keeps constantly open to public-private partnership projects
and activities to be carried out in the ISS. âItalian coffee is a beverage without borders â comments Giuseppe Lavazza, Vice President
of Lavazza â and we have been thinking about taking the espresso into
space for some time. Indeed, as far back as ten years ago we launched
the espresso into orbit artistically with the photographs taken by
Thierry Le GouÃ¨s and our Mission to Espresso calendar, which at the
time may have looked like a work of science fiction but was actually
just a vision of the future. In fact, today we are in a position to
overcome the limits of weightlessness and enjoy a good espresso â the
indisputable symbol of made in Italy products â on board the
International Space Station. We are proud to have worked on this major
project with Argotec, through the Lavazza Innovation Center, our
division dedicated to research and product innovation: a scientific
and engineering challenge which we hope will improve the living and
nutrition quality of astronauts engaged on long missions.â âOur aerospace engineers â stated David Avino, Managing Director of Argotec
â have designed a new-concept coffeemaker, which is safe for the
astronauts and able to function in microgravity conditions, also
thanks to Lavazzaâs experience as a leader in capsule extraction 2
systems. The functional project was already completed in June 2013:
Argotec had been working on it for about one year. This is an ultra
high-tech project which has led to innovative solutions, applicable
with immediate returns on Earth as well. ISSpresso is a technological
challenge that meets very stringent requirements, imposed by the
Italian Space Agency, in terms of technical functionality and safety.
In addition to the engineering aspect, Argotec is also taking care of
the European astronautsâ training and nutrition. Food provides an
important psychological support and being able to enjoy a good Italian
espresso may be just the right way to finish off the menu designed
especially for each astronaut, helping him or her to feel closer to
home.â Roberto Battiston, President of the Italian Space Agency added:
âISSpresso is a perfect example of the way ISA's decision to make ISS
national usage rights available to public-private partnership
initiatives can result in a valorisation of public resources for
technological, economic, and social objectives. The ISA will bring
ISSpresso aboard the ISS, thanks to bilateral cooperation agreements
with the NASA, as it shares with the project partners the objective of
improving the quality of life of ISS astronauts, as well as the
astronauts who will take part in future long interplanetary
exploration missions. At the same time, we are also proud to
contribute to the promotion of the image and spreading of the
Made-in-Italy brand at international or better âspaceâ, level.â A coffee break in space. A prototype of the space coffee machine is
currently being tested at Argotecâs laboratories and all the necessary
functional and safety checks. In a subsequent phase, Finmeccanica â
Selex ES will participate in the assessment activities aimed at
launching ISSpresso into orbit with the Futura Mission crew, one of
whom is the Italian astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti. The âcorner
cafÃ©â on the ISS will be the hub for socialising on board the Station,
a sort of social network in space, a venue for getting together,
chatting and relaxing: an aspect that should not be ignored in
missions that keep the astronauts away from home for many months in a
very challenging environment. The innovative capsule system will also
be able to prepare not only a regular espresso, but also a caffÃ¨ lungo
or hot beverages, such as tea, infusions and broth, so that food can
also be rehydrated. Extra-terrestrial technology. Every tiniest detail
of ISSpresso is designed to respond to a scientific and engineering
challenge: in fact, the machine studies have enabled principles of
physics and fluid dynamics to be tackled, such as the difficulty of
handling liquids at high pressure and high temperature in a space
environment. Just think that the plastic tube carrying the water
inside a normal espresso machine has been replaced with a special
steel tube designed to withstand pressure of more than 400 bar. The
machine is so complex that it weighs about 20 kilograms since there
are back-ups of all the critical components for safety reasons in
accordance with the specifications agreed upon with the Italian Space
Agency. ISSpresso represents a technologically high-value project
which, besides increasing the variety of flavour in the astronautsâ
menu, will help improve our understanding of the principles of fluid
dynamics and conditions in microgravity. Some of the solutions adopted
have led to international patents, which will be useful both for
future space missions and immediate terrestrial use... tl;dr It looks like its a heavy duty capsule system designed to withstand high pressure that not only makes coffee, but makes tea, broth, infusions and re-hydrates food. Just found images on The Guardian:  And on http://walyou.com/lavazza-argotec-isspresso/ "
Can I get rid of this wood fiber taste?,"I would suggest buying any other kind of non-flavored coffee (or borrowing some) and using your same parameters to make a pot.  That should determine whether your machine/process is imparting that taste to the beans or if it's just the coffee itself.   Lightly roasted coffee often has tastes described as woody, grassy, or sometimes tea like.  This can vary from very noticeable at light roast levels to not at all noticeable at moderate levels.  Even if you have purchased those same beans before and were not expecting the taste, it's possible you purchased a bag less roasted than previous bags you have bought. "
Where can I get Koiwai coffee milk delivered to Europe?,"You can buy them from Rakuten. They ship internationally, with the exception of some countries, due to them not sufficing to the standards.  I don't believe there to be such a limit in Europe though, so you should be fine. It costs Â¥ 3,369 which comes down to roughly $27. And no account is required to order. "
Whats special about the Hario V60 filterpapers?,"Short version: The Hario brand filters are thinner than other paper filters and seem to have more texture than other types of filters. I assume this has some, but perhaps slight, impact on the rate at which water passes through the filter and also what ""stuff"" passes through the filter, which impacts the resulting brew and its taste. Longer version: The rest of this response is basically a comparison of the Hario filters to other types of filters. This isn't particularly authoritative nor scientific. I don't immediately find any good online resources on this; one video that I don't care to link or watch, and another article from Serious Eats on dripper styles but it doesn't compare the filters themselves as such. So, I'm going rogue. The different cone (and filter) manufacturers each have their own shape, presumably to ensure product lock-in for consumables (in this case, primarily filters). Here are the three primary ones that I'm aware of: 
Clockwise from upper left: off-brand Melitta-style #2, Hario brand V60 02, Chemex brand pre-folded bonded. All are ""natural"" brown (unbleached, etc.) varieties. My basic summary, having looked at these three examples from my own stockpile (certainly, this is a small sample) in order from thickest to thinnest: Frankly, I don't notice a significant difference in coffee draining rate (throughput), but I suspect there is. I (personally) think there's a slight difference in taste and output of the brew, but perhaps I'm fooling myself into legitimizing more coffee gear. As stated in this other question about Hario V60 filters off-brand filters do not seem common (in our regions)."
"When accounting for bloom, why is the common instruction to stir with very little water?","Blooming is the outgassing of CO2 (carbon dioxide) from the ground coffee in response to hot water being added.  The more recently the coffee has been roasted, the more bloom you can expect.  It doesn't make a huge difference ultimately if this is done quickly or slowly when you brew your coffee.  What I have noticed myself is that it's sometimes diffcult to predict how much foam is going to be produced when the water is poured over the grounds.  More than once I have misjudged the amount of bloom and made a foamy brown mess on my countertop.  If you just add enough water to wet the grounds first, you accomplish two things.   First, all the coffee is wetted at nearly the same time which better controls how the flavors are extracted, since different flavor profiles extract at different rates.  Sometimes adding all the water at once creates lumps of dry coffee mixed in with the bloom and wetted coffee and it takes a bit of stirring to get all that wetted.   Secondly, adding a small amount of water controls how quickly the bloom will occur. You'll get most of the bloom done well within the pot and you'll avoid the huge foam ball at the top of your brew that might overflow the pot (or AeroPress in my case), but really this is more of a technique thing than a chemistry thing.

Why are commercial coffee machines significantly more expensive than consumer machines?,"Disclaimer: I have no coffee maker designing or manufacturing experience.  This answer is based on internet research and professional experience.  This answer addresses some of the product design challenges and less of the real engineering challenges, but a lead into the engineering challenges. Based on the question and comment I believe OP is interested in designing a coffee maker. From a business standpoint most organizations strive to service segments of the market that organizations believe they have a competitive advantage. These organizations also try to offer products to meet opening (OPP), mid (MPP) and High (HPP) price points. Also branding place a significant part in product pricing.  Assumption: US dollar = Euro (Approximately, 1 Euro = 1.09 US$)  Coffee Maker Product Landscape
Based on the above I did some research on food services warehouse and selected Grindmaster for this analysis. Base on list price following are the price point classification (Dollars $) Below is a table for OPP, MPP, and HPP price segmentation (April 6th, 2015)  Lets assume the following as customer segments Requirements Analysis:
Flow rate was chosen to keep the analysis simple Engineering Analysis Product Design
Consider the Motor (Rotor, Stator, Casting) or the heating element from the BOM. Each of the price points (PP) most like need a different type of component. The component price to meet the above flow rate specification can be significantly different. Also the product volume is each PP is different thus for HPP or even MPP product it is highly unlikely to obtain volume base pricing that OPP might enjoy. Thus explains the cost of components.  Product Testing, Validation and Manufacturing
The cost of testing, validation and manufacturing will be much higher for MPP and HPP product because the consumer demands for higher quality product compared to OPP products.  Thus the non-recurring engineering (NRE) cost per machine will much higher for MPP and HPP product than the OPP products. Product Serviceability and Support
An OPP price point product needs very little from a serviceability and after sale support compared to MPP or HPP product. An OPP customer is most likely replace a defective coffee maker with a new coffee make where is MPP or HPP customer will consider maintenance. Also consider a customer like Starbuck or Panera, they demand for high quality, and zero downtime. Therefore the components used in MPP or HPP coffee makers of significantly higher quality than the OPP coffee makers.   Product Pricing VS BOM price -> General rule of thumb is BOM cost is 1/5 the Product Price. I believe this is a good starting point to figure what take to compete in the intended the coffee maker market. It appears that the coffee maker market is a red ocean. Therefore it important identify the point of differentiation.  References:"
"The one-way valve, to squeeze or not to squeeze?","It doesn't actually matter! The valve on the bag is there to let gas out without letting gas in. The reason for this is that freshly roasted beans will continue to give off a bit of CO2 for a little while. Coffee that's packaged immediately after roasting will give off a bit in the bag, hence the need for a valve. Oxygen causes coffee to go off, which is why we keep our coffee in airtight containers to preserve it as long as possible. It's why the valve on the bag is designed to prevent air from the outside getting in. The CO2 that's accumulating in the bags is essentially inert, and won't cause the coffee beans to go off. It makes no difference whether you squeeze it out or not!"
Yemenite tea-like coffee?,"It sounds like you had coffee cherry tea, also called cascara, and regionally other names; in Yemen it seems to be called qishr according to Wikipedia.  It's (to me) delicious, but rather different than roasted, brewed coffee beans. It has a lovely red hue, similar to rooibos but lighter.  It's made by infusing the dried coffee cherries or just the husks (as you described in the question). It is steeped like an herbal tea, in hot water just off the boil. This article says that it can be brewed using cold-brew techniques also. I've only had it cold/iced or lukewarm, but it is probably lovely hot also. "
Purpose of Hole in Moka Funnel,"Just guessing here, but the hole could keep the water from going up until it reaches a certain temperature. The amount of pressure from the steam varies on the temperature of the water, and if there weren't enough pressure, the water would recycle. However, if the pressure were greater, the velocity of the water would prevent it from dripping out of the hole. This could explain the bursts, since the pressure would rise and fall depending on the amount of water it pushed out. The more water that escapes, the more room there is left behind for pressure to fill. Also, you mentioned a weird taste. Could it be metallic? If so, you could try letting the base sit in a strong coffee/water mixture for a couple days. The moka pot needs to be seasoned to prevent this taste, so I would recommend not washing it with soap - just rinse. My grandmother has never washed hers."
Adding creamer after boiling water vs before,"I wouldn't say it would amplify it, and you may very well not be able to tell much of a difference. Unless the milk or cream is hot, your coffee won't brew very well (or at least not as fast) on just the milk alone. So by the time you add your hot water, it still shouldn't have dissolved the instant coffee enough to make much of a difference.
If you wanted to experiment, I would try adding some hot cream or milk to the instant coffee first and stirring it up a bit. Still probably wouldn't make much of a difference other than it tasting more like a latte. "
What qualities do I need from an espresso machine or steam wand in order to produce good latte art?,"In my experience, it is difficult to achieve perfect microfoam with a home brewing espresso machine. Essentially what you need is a 15 bar pump and a boiler chamber big enough to hold enough steam to have higher pressure and volumes of steam. Unfortunately, this usually means you need to buy a bigger espresso machine which means it is going to be a bit more pricey. Since manufacturers don't always give technical specifications on what size boilers they use, you may have to rely on customer reviews for this aspect. They should always give the strength of the pump though. In my own personal experience, the smallest espresso machine with which I have been able to achieve perfect microfoam is this. However, I was professionally trained in a coffee shop for two years using an industrial machine.  For you, I might recommend that you go up a size or two. Breville is an excellent brand and has good machines that make good foam. Aside from that, you do want a 360 degree rotational steam wand so you can control your milk. Also, you want your steam wand to just be plain and simple and not have one of those 'frothing helpers' for beginners. Most come with it but are removable. You will need to learn how to control air injection on your own."
Downsides of brewing espresso with high pressure?,"A higher pressure is fine, as long as it is a controlled variable. You may have to tamp harder or start with a finer grind in order to accommodate the higher pressure. The increase in pressure otherwise would cause a faster brewing time and ergo underextraction of the coffee puck. What's important is that you keep your pressure consistent. An occasional or erratic bout of high pressure makes your yield unpredictable."
Using an areo press with Maxwell house?,"Yes, of course! As ""fancy"" coffee company Counter Culture says: Any Coffee, Any Brew. In fact, even things that aren't actually coffee (barley, tea, herbs, etc.) could be brewed like coffee in an AeroPress or other coffee-brewing equipment. But if fancy coffee is not your preference (or not practical, or not available, or whatever), try something different. And why not a cultural staple like Maxwell House (or Folgers or NescafÃ© or Eight O'Clock or CafÃ© du Monde or ...)? In fact, a mass-market coffee like this might benefit from AeroPress treatment. For example, some of these blends include a significant portion of Robusta beans, which is a traditional component of many blends (including some Italian espresso blends). Robusta might have some advantages in an AeroPress. Robusta produces more crema in espresso, and might be a way to get more crema from AeroPress. Robusta also has slightly more caffeine than Arabica, so that's something else you might be looking for. Since AeroPress (generally) infuses for less time than drip, you might reduce a bit of the bitterness sometimes present in mass-market coffees (regardless of bean makeup). There might be a few problems, though. First, the default grind of pre-ground coffee like Maxwell House is rather course for an AeroPress. You could try to re-grind the coffee to be a bit finer, but it's generally not recommended because it can clog grinders (see more on this from Home-Barista and Bunn). Second, if there are other ""stuff"" in the coffee (e.g., ""Folgers Crystals"" or other additives) this might not behave the same way in the AeroPress as it might for drip. But give it a try! In the best case, you can enjoy a mass-market coffee even more than you'd expect. In the worst case, you're out a few quid, but you have a fun story and a hefty caffeine buzz."
"In home roasting, does the time spent roasting matter, or only the final temperature?","It does matter for a couple of reasons. Drawing out the roast generally produces more even results. Slower roasts mean that you have a better chance of stopping the roast at the target level and not over or under roasting. You can search the online forums for some of the home roasting sites, but many people run their roasters at a higher setting, then turn down the heat once the roasting process is rolling.  Some of the more expensive machines even have ""roast profiles"" preprogrammed to modulate the temperature up and down for desired results.   Personally I think there is a point of diminishing returns between the time dinkering with the roaster and the difference in the taste.  Most of my roasting lands in the 15 to 16 minute range and comes out even enough that I feel good about it.  I recommend drawing the time out just enough that the results are even enough for you and you are comfortably hitting your target roast level the vast majority of the time. "
Is there a way to get Caffe d'orzo in North America?,"You should be able to find the roasted barley itself in an international food store, often sold for steeping like tea (a tisane). It is often called mugicha (Japanese) or other names. When prepared for tea, it is sometimes sold blended with, e.g., green tea, so be sure to check the label. Alternatively, a home-brewing outlet will probably have roasted, malted barley available. This will be even sweeter and maltier still.  Amazon also sells roasted barley for tea in bags. I'm sure it would be a bit different when brewed like espresso but maybe similar enough and convenient in tea bags. I like the taste of the tea-like infusion, like toasted malt.  I think your idea to brew in a moka pot is a good one, but you'll have to find a grind that works well: I suspect a grind just a bit coarser than you would normally use for moka would be a good place to start. I don't think you need to be worried about equipment damage, but I haven't tried this (yet!). Next time I can get my hands on some mugicha I think I shall!"
"Of the various methods of decaffeinating coffee, which is the safest?","Swiss Water process is the best because it's the most natural and has the best percentage of decaffeination. However, none of the processes are dangerous, I repeat, none. Unless you consume the decaffeinating solvents somehow, that's a different case. -.- Sourced from my previous answer at How is decaffeinated coffee made?"
How to prevent calcium loss when drinking a lot of coffee?,"Apparently, drinking caffeinated beverages shouldn't affect you calcium level if you get your recommended daily intake of calcium. According to this review of the literature on the subject: There is no evidence that caffeine has any harmful effect on bone
  status or on the calcium economy in individuals who ingest the
  currently recommended daily allowances of calcium. That said, there does seem to be a connection between high caffeiene intake and low calcium intake, meaning that there is significant overlap between individuals who drink caffeinated beverages and don't get enough calcium from their diets, but implying a causal relationship is dubious. Luckily, ...the negative effect of caffeine on calcium absorption is small enough
  to be fully offset by as little as 1-2 tablespoons of milk. Most milk alternatives (like soy or almond milks) are fortified with calcium and other nutrients and drinking them in place of milk should do the trick, just be mindful of the high sugar content of many of the milk alternatives available. Also, I wouldn't worry about your daily coffee dose, 1.4 billion cups of coffee [2] are poured every day and if there were serious health risks associated with daily caffeine ingestion, we'd know about them!"
How do I stop my Hario Skerton from squeaking when I grind beans?,"It depends on ""where"" the squeaking is coming from. Two contact points that might squeak are the burrs themselves and the top part of the crank rod. The good news is that the whole thing dis-/re-assembles rather easily, and in fact this is pretty much necessary for changing the coarseness setting. I'd suggest two possibilities based on my own Hario manual grinder. "
Methods to get a better taste out of iced coffee,"Iced coffee, specifically drip brewed coffee poured over ice has a few things to consider with respect to taste.  Often it comes down to taste what in particular might work to make your iced coffee better. A different bean type or roast level, maybe on that is slightly less acidic or more bold may give you the flavor you are looking for. "
How does distilled water or water filtered by reverse osmosis affect the taste of coffee?,"I've heard that the mineral content in water assists in the distribution of the particulate that's extracted when brewing coffee. While I've not used distilled water, I have used reverse osmosis water (I live in an area with very hard water). I tend to prefer using the reverse osmosis water to the tap water. I don't particularly care for the taste of distilled water on its own, which is why I have avoided using it in coffee."
Is there any way to overcome cycling with a moka on an induction stove?,"As far as my experience with Moka pots, I don't have them on the stove for long. Something that I got in that habit of doing when using moka pots is to boil the water before I put it in the Moka pot, then introducing it to heat, then removing shortly after it starts to percolate. Stumptown illustrates a similar method. As for the induction stove cycling to maintain a steady temp, if you set the temperature over boiling(212F, but may differ by altitude) it likely won't cycle. This is because water will not exceed boiling point, under most circumstances, in a liquid state. For instance water is often used to prevent things from burning, because it keeps the temperature below the boiling temperature until all the water is evaporated. So if you set the induction stove to above the water's boiling point it will likely not exceed that temperature. It might take a bit to find a sweet spot. Though I'm not sure, I have never used an induction stove with a moka pot. Something I had not considered is the boiling point increases with pressure. So it might be worth turning the heat up quite a bit beyond 212F/100C. Its pretty difficult to burn water. Then again if you're using an induction stove to avoid heat pollution on the moka pot, then you can just use a traditional stove with the method I described and avoid the need to use an induction stove."
Are there any disadvantages to shade grown coffee?,"I suppose flavor won't be changed. Most coffee beans are grown just like that. They require shade or they will die of too much sunlight. Having too much water will sometimes drown the plant to death. Here is a website that lists three main disadvantages and some advantages to shade grown coffee. If the plant is under too much shade, fungi-related infections will attack and feed on the plant. This will ruin your plant and destroy it. Yet having too much sunlight will burn the plant instead. You can't say that this type of shade gown plant is used in every country of different altitudes.. Some places require more shade (those with a high altitude) and others less shade (those with a low altitude). It depends on where you will plant your coffee plant. This directly copied from the website, word for word. The amount of shade needed will also depends on the sunlight's strength. Nearer the equator, it is stronger so more shade is required. Farther from the equator, it is weaker so less shade is needed. There are maybe more, but these are some basic and critical disadvantages to shad grown planting. I hope this helps you!  "

Is stale coffee less healthy for you than fresh coffee?,"Disclaimer: Lately, I was checking some unanswered questions. This one stands for a while. So, I decided to use the advantages of sitting in an academic office and sought the academic databases I can think of. Some of them are only accessible by abstract. However, I will try to copy the essence of them here without disturbing copyright rules of the publishers. First things first, I tried to understand the effect of going stale to the amount of antioxidants in coffee. It seems not. My first reference is ""Antioxidant capacity, phenolic acids and caffeine contents of some commercial coffees available on the Romanian market."" by Trandafir I., Nour V, and Ionica M.E. which you can read its abstract here. According to this article, total amount of antioxidants in a regular coffee sold in the market is changing in between 19.8 to 41.9 mg per gram coffee. My second reference is ""Recovery of Natural Antioxidants from Spent Coffee Grounds"" by Alessia Panusa, Antonio Zuorro, Roberto Lavecchia, Giancarlo Marrosu, and Rita Petrucci which you can read its abstract here. According to this article, total amount of antioxidants in the remains of the spent espresso waste is changing in between 17.07 to 35.52 mg per gram coffee. I conclude that, even after brewing (chemically speaking; extraction or leaching) the antioxidant amount is not changing much. Then, I tried to understand what changes the antioxidant level in coffee, if there exist something. Yes, there is one; here comes the third reference by Ayelign and Sabally, ""Determination of Chlorogenic Acids (CGA) in Coffee Beans using HPLC"" which you can download a copy of it from here. In this study, it is shown that the level of CGAs (an antioxidant) is dropped from 46.144 mg to 0.981 mg per gram coffee, more the coffee is roasted."
To what extent have C. arabica beans been replaced by rust-resistant cultivars?,"Even with the impact of below average crop yields from Coffee Rust, Arabica beans still make up at least 75% of the world's coffee crop.

They are still vulnerable to other desease that can have an impact on crops.  USDA report on Coffee Rust impact to Arabica crops 2014 article on the Impact of Coffee Rust"
How many cups of coffee is it safe to consume per day?,"I would recommend scanning the DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 5th edition) on caffeine and coffee addiction, as well as looking at independent studies. Because caffeine is the most widely consumed psychoactive substance there have been many studies done on the benefits and side affects, both of which can be highly dependent on what type of person you are specifically. Generally speaking, caffeine is considered safe for healthy adults, and you should guage your consumption based on what you think fits your lifestyle"
Generating Crema with a manual machine,"You should make sure that the coffee runs through with at least 6 bar pressure. If your pressure is below that value, you won't get a crema. The recommended pressure for Espresso is 9 bar Â± 1, according to the Italian National Espresso Institute."
What molds grow in brewed coffee?,"Though I don't have any articles on the matter, I can certainly say I've found cups of coffee that I had forgotten that are only maybe a week old with mold growing in them. I'd assume it gets contaminated so quickly, because of its sugar content. It might just be a coincidence, but it seems to happen more readily with coffee that I brew over ice. I press my areopress directly over ice, I've heard this reduces the acidity. Which would make sense, as acidity usually wards off mold. I leave all of my coffee black and unsweetened, so it is not dairy or added sugars that are causing this. Perhaps try variating your brewing process. I'd be especially keen on the pH. Maybe there are some spores which will not grow in environments below a certain pH."
Espresso - Dose affecting extraction time disproportionately,"I would not exceed 20 grams on a twenty gram basket. Weird things start to happen.  I would make your grind finer - and simply stop your shot quicker. If it tastes overextracted, then stop your shot even quicker the next time. Adjust accordingly until you get the sweetest shot you possibly can.  Your general espresso recipe for a well roasted coffee should be somewhere around: 20 grams of coffee in
extracted for 26 seconds
A yield of around 30 grams of espresso I hope this helps and good luck!"
How do I effectively clean a metal Chemex filter?,"This problem seems quite normal. Over time, the little holes are filled up with small coffee grounds and stuck there by the help of gluing force of grease. This grease is extracted during brewing process. So, how could we get rid of these remains? Pretty easy. As they are organic compounds, you should dissolve them. As they include grease, dissolve the oil that includes particles. Best options are: Heat is the most effective option as it burns out the organic compounds without leaving any residue. Place the filter in the oven or BBQ while doing a cleaning cycle. Youâd be amazed  at the results. Check the comparison: Before cleaning After cleaning As for the to other options, These acids are food, so they are safe to use. You may leave the filter in these for a while. Apart from that, you may try alcohol, but check whether it damages the filter. Last option may be bleach. It dissolves any organic compound quite easily as it is corrosive. However, it is not safe. You must rinse it thoroughly."
"How long should I stir French press before ""pressing""?","It's mostly a personal preference Stirring increases the turbulence, which is supposed to help for a more even extraction and change some flavor qualities of your coffee (such as the acidity and bitterness). In reality, you might not even notice it. I know I don't, and so far I've only met one (non-barista) person who's able to tell the difference (he didn't like a lot of turbulence)."
What are the side effects of drinking too much coffee?,"Caffeinated beverages like coffee and soft drinks give short bursts of energy, but can actually cause fluid loss. Caffeine has been shown to temporarily raise blood pressure, and reduces blood flow to inactive limbs. Like many drugs, caffeine is chemically addictive and recent publication of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), caffeine withdrawal was finally included as a mental disorder for the first time. Soon after you drink coffee (containing caffeine), itâs absorbed through the small intestine and dissolved into the bloodstream and itâs able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and enter the brain. Regular ingestion of the drug (i.e. coffee/tea, soda or energy drinks) alters your brainâs chemistry and physical characteristics actually change over time, leading to fatigue, headaches and nausea if you try to quit. However, compared to many drug addictions, the effects are relatively short-term. Few quotes from Daily Mail: Large amounts of caffeine can cause heart palpitations, fits and even death, as well as raising the risk of Type 2 diabetes. Heavy consumption has also been linked to a greater risk of depression, addiction and alcohol dependency. Energy drinks could be more likely to cause a caffeine overdose because they can be drunk quickly, unlike hot drinks like tea or coffee, the Energy Drink Consumption in Europe study said. Several deaths worldwide have been linked to excessive consumption of energy drinks, although scientists say more research is needed to prove a link. Recommended maximum caffeine intake is about 400mg per day â equivalent to around five cups of filter coffee. 'Reproductive-aged women (â©½ 300 mg caffeine per day) and children are âat riskâ subgroups who may require specific advice on moderating their caffeine intake', study said. On Live Science we can read: Coffee drinking could lead to a mental disorder. If you experience
five or more symptoms, such as red face, nervousness and restlessness,
during or right after your cup of Joe, you may be diagnosed with
coffee intoxication. According to a new edition of the American Psychiatric Associationâs Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), excessive caffeine intake can lead to a condition known as âcaffeine intoxication,â. In other words, caffeine withdrawal is now a recognized disorder, and is listed in the DSM-5. âCaffeine is a drug, a mild stimulant, which is used by almost
everybody on a daily basis,â said Dr. Charles OâBrien, who chairs the
Substance-Related Disorder Work Group for DSM-5 (via New York Post).
âBut it does have a letdown afterwards. If you drink a lot of coffee,
at least two or three [236 ml] cups at a time, there will be a rebound
or withdrawal effect.â Here are top 10 caffeine withdrawal symptoms: In rare cases when consumed at high enough doses, caffeine can kill.  In the world's most expensive Starbucks coffee featuring 60 espresso shots, according to my calculations, there is over 9000mg (150x60) of caffeine content, comparing to recommended maximum caffeine intake of 400mg per day (equivalent to over 100 cups of filtered coffee). So drinking it will end up with headache, fast heartbeat, heart palpitations and even death, so it require emergency care as soon as possible. Here is SAMHSA data of emergency department visits related to misuse of energy drinks (energy drinks can be looked at as caffeine) and it is really alarming:  SAMHSA report puts it: Large amounts of caffeine can cause adverse effects such as insomnia,
nervousness, headache, fast heartbeat, and seizures that are severe

How can I get a more even grind with a rotary grinder?,"""Using more or less beans in a single grinding session"" will yield the most bang for buck, usually.  However, this is highly dependent on your particular rotary grinder.  Rotary grinders are like miniature blenders.  Just like in a full size blender trying to make a milkshake or something, if you over- or under-fill the blender, then the blade won't be able to mix the ingredients as it cuts through them.  Cheap grinders won't be designed to mix very well as they grind, so with terrible grinders, you probably won't see much benefit to your strides. You need to experiment with your particular blade-style rotary grinder to see how much you can add without prohibiting movement once the beans are fully chopped up, and without leaving too much movement where they just bounce around inside.  Too much room will create friction from the grinder chamber sides, and will start to warm up the coffee oils.  Too little room will result in the same bean being over-ground (too much friction from the blade), and you'll get coffee paste in the inner center of the grinder chamber. Achieving consistency and repeatability to the level of a fast-food chain will be impossible, as rotary grinders are way to sensitive to how many beans you put in, as well as size and shape of the bean, how hard the bean is (age of bean), lunar phase, etc.  Maybe this is why all the big coffee chains use more expensive burr grinders in-store (not that the coffee is better, which it arguably is, its just more predictable).  Some fancy rotary grinders have timers and knobs and levers to set so you don't have to count to yourself before you let go of the grind-button.  That helps, but is far from a silver bullet."

I suppose the rice would not be burnt1 (because that would taste horrible), but roasted instead. Healthwise it is perfectly safe, like the other options mentioned above. Just note that rice has no caffeine, so you wouldn't get the ""kick"" you get from real coffee. 1  original post said ""burnt"", has now been changed to ""roasted"""
Triple heating of the Turkish coffee,"Disclaimer: This will be a long answer. I expect that it wont be as good as I want at first. I may make corrections/additions afterwards. I am a native Turkish, drinking kgs of coffee each week and from a coffee addicted family for generations. Therefore, I count myself as a Turkish-coffee hobbyist. I believe to understand the two or three times boiling mystery of Turkish coffee, you must understand the whole Turkish-style extraction process. I tell you the whole story. The chemistry is simple: we are extracting some oils from the beans. Two known ways out there, pressure or heat. Turkish extraction is the traditional, genuine, historical heating way. Actually, it is probably the first and easiest way manhood used in history to prepare coffee (I believe both in Africa and then in Ottoman Empire). When you heat the beans to extract, you need lots of surface to extract efficiently. That's why you grind the beans as fine as possible. The electrical grinders are not always perfect. You may want to use a mortar after the grinding process to be sure if you don't have a Turkish grinder. (This is another topic, I think.) Then, the aromatic oils you are trying to extract are not of one kind. There are several kinds. The drink you consume under the name of coffee is delicious if it includes many of them. So, you are trying to jail all of them into the water during the brewing process. But, wait... Some of them start to be released from the bean at 75 degrees Celsius, but some others have been already vaporized at 70 degrees Celsius! There must be a way of collecting all of them. Bingo! You are right. It is the double (triple, quadruple, ...) heating process. You should heat the water up to some point, extract a subset of the oils, separate them to your fincan (cup). Then repeat the process at a higher degree. Three times is the best practice among Turks. You may define your own temperature slots and repetition count but I think the algorithm is clear now. Talking about best practice, let me show you a best practice. Get you cezve (pot). Mine is stainless steel and thick. Your coffee should not boil on the edges first, it must start to boil from the center. (If this is not the case, either your cezve or your fire is problematic.)  If you have a hand grinder, set it to the finest. 
 Measure the water with fincan (cup) (I prefer soft spring water) and fill your cezve. Traditional fincans are quite thin (in contrast to espresso cups) and porcelain.  After you fill in your cezve with water, add coffee on top. About one teaspoon per fincan is quite OK. (You may change). I don't recommend sugar for any kind of coffee, but it is your taste. If you want to add sugar, it is now or never.  You will see that fine grounded coffee will float and sink in time. Fire up and let the coffee sink by itself. Do not touch or stir. The amount of fire has little or no affect to the taste of Turkish coffee to my experience. There is an urban legend that states that Turkish coffee is best made in wood fire or very slowly in low temperatures, etc. It's nonsense. Then, every aromatic oil will evaporate eventually. You should be quick. These are just romantic/melancholic scenes for old days heard from grandfathers. This was my setting.  After a while, all coffee will eventually sink. This is an indicator. Your coffee is somewhat homogeneously distributed in water. Also you have a nice grease remains already on top of water. However, they cannot form a foam yet. Cause, we didn't stir it.  Start stirring.   Now, stop. Please check the foam. You have a quite nice foam already. Very very light color. No bubbles at all. It is not mature yet. If you want to be experienced in Turkish-style coffee brewing, look at that foam a lot. Follow its color and forms.  Stir again. For about a minute. Stirring keeps the foam intact. You may stop from time to time to check the color and then continue. It gets mature when you first see the red/fire color. Check the second image. Could you see the firefox there? Could you? Ok, now it is time for the first shot. Actually, I would like you to compare the second foam image with the one above. Try to figure out the differences. We started with light color, it turned out to red/fire color. We started with no bubbles, it has bubbles now. We'll pour some of the coffee to our fincans. I pour the foamy part and fill about 2/5 of my fincans. 

 Still, I have enough foam and lots of oils to extract in my ground beans. I continue to heat and stir. Don't forget to stir and keep foam intact. This time the foam turns from red/fire to brown/coffee-bean-color. Still, I'm very far from boiling. Fill another 2/5 of your fincans. The fincans are nearly full. 
 I would like to keep your attention to one point. At this point, you see the famous marbled foam of Turkish coffee for the first time. The reason is, you've mixed two different subsets of oils for the first time. Our final destination is to produce a coffee foam marbled with three colors.  Now, we hardly have any foam left in our cezve. We are heating the coffee for the last shot. This will be very close to the boiling point. You can hardly see any foam now, but mostly bubbles. At one point, the boiling starts in the middle. Take the cezve out of the fire very quickly to prevent burning the coffee and pour the rest of the coffee to the fincans. (You really need to be quick, so I couldn't find time to focus and burnt the coffee a bit. Still, you can sense the boiling center. Sorry, for this picture and also I cannot provide a triple marbled foam for now as it burnt.) 
 Normally, there shouldn't be any grounds remain in cezve. Everything must be dissolved homogeneously in water.  Traditionally, we prefer to serve Turkish coffee with half a sip of liquor of sharp tastes. Like mint, quince, sour cherry or bitter almond. This time, it was hazelnut liquor.  A correctly prepared Turkish coffee is not a suspension of coffee grounds in water. Coffee grounds lay at the bottom and never fill in your mouth. The drinkable part stays on top.  Final words: This is it. I hope both theoretic and practical part helps people. Please leave comments so I can further advance this answer in time."
Is it okay to compost used grounds?,"As an avid composter I can say that I have always used lots of coffee grounds and my compost has always done well with it. There are a few reasons why it is beneficial: A good rule of thumb with composting is everything in moderation, so there is such thing as too much used coffee in the pile. When I empty my indoor compost bin into the outside bin coffee is generally 10-25% of that green material. If it is more than 50% you probably need to reduce the amount to compost or find more green material sources."
Whatâs the best all purpose zero retention grinder for single dosing?,"I have a Baratza Sette 270 along with the S2 Cone Burr which is better suited for courser grinds and have been very happy with the result.  I like it for its vertical drop of the beans straight through the blades into the cup, rather than having to be shunted to a chute off the side. While I find I still have to use the Ross Droplet Technique and give a few slaps on the lid during the last couple of seconds while it is grinding, when I do that, weighing the coffee before and after shows little or no difference before and after. (Can't say the same for my previous grinders that I had to thump hard to get all the grinds out.) I use it happily for aeropress, moka pot and siphons. The reviews mention there's an upper limit of the coarseness the Sette's can produce, but it has been fine for me so far. There's also the 30 and the 270Wi models in the Sette range depending on the features you want and your budget."
How acidic is Liberica compared to Arabica and Robusta?,"Today I had a coffee tasting of Liberica on various roast levels.
I can say that Liberica is totally different from Arabica and Robusta. I would say Robusta lover may not prefer Liberica, but if you found Arabica and Robusta is too bitter, you may love Liberica wich is full of aftertaste flavours if roasted right. A mid range Liberica is comparable to a high grade Arabica.
An Arabica or Robusta blend with Liberica would complete a full coffee flavour. Liberica is rare because it was almost extinct due to coffee rust disease and it is very expensive due to scarcity."
Is soap/water enough to get safely clean coffee mold from my mug?,"I would feel confident drinking out of a ceramic mug after a good scrubbing with soap and water.  Smooth (glazed) ceramic surfaces are more easily cleaned than rough ones, so perhaps the rough ones deserves extra effort. If there is a concern about sanitizing the mug, putting water in the mug and leaving it in the microwave on high until the water boils should kill any mold.  According to this 2012 Penn State Extension bulletin on important temperatures for food safety: Processing foods in a boiling water bath will kill most bacteria, molds and yeasts."
How can I better work coffee into my morning routine,"I had a similar problem and I ended with aeropress. To speed up the process I use pre-grinded coffee which I store in the fridge. Once you press the coffee, the cleanup is very fast."
Can you practice latte art with UHT milk?,"Back then when i got my first espresso machine i was recommended a method using a pinch of dishwashing soap in a pitcher with water. This way i was able to practice and enhance my frothing skills.  Be sure to find the correct dose of soap and be aware that soap residue can stick to the steamwand, so remember to clean it by purging the same way as you would froth milk.  I find this method much more suitable than wasting a lot milk if you intend to do it a couple of times a day for practicing."
What influence do the dry residuals of previous coffee in the cup have on the drinking experience?,"You're actually asking two different questions.  The minute amount of coffee left to evaporate in the bottom of a cup will have completely oxidized and lost virtually all of its volatile compounds (i.e. It probably wouldn't taste very good if you reconstituted it on its own). So when you add more fresh coffee to that cup, yes, you are essentially adding a minute amount of an external (and somewhat off) flavor component to your brew. Now whether that flavor component contributes to any any perceptible change in flavor is highly debatable. Line up 100 coffee drinkers in a blind tasting, and I suspect there would be no statistically significant detection between ""100% fresh"" and ""Christian's 0.083% dust-like coffee residuals."" Your analogy to washing tea cans in a dishwasher is a bit off. Washing containers in a dishwasher is generally known to leave a perceptible taste of soap on the container. Soap is completely foreign to the coffee-tasking experience so it is easily tasted if it is present. But the residuals you are leaving behind in your unwashed-coffee-cup study are still essentially coffee (somewhat off coffee, but coffee nonetheless). So mixing the equivalent of ""a few drops"" of off coffee in a hot cup of fresh I suspect will have no perceptible effect on taste.  I also suspect that your coffee cup experiment is not evolving over the years. The metallic cup is likely stainless steel or perhaps aluminum (and most coffee cups are made of ceramic). In either case, the cup is largely stainless, so you are not likely building up any patinaâ¦ so you are essentially ""washing away"" the previous day's experiment each time you add a fresh cup of hot coffee. There should be no substantial, cumulative effect."
"Is ""cold brew"" an oxymoron?","Yes, the term is an oxymoron. Miriam Webster agrees with your definition of brewing involving hot water: to prepare (as tea) by infusion in hot water That is why the word cold is used as a qualifier to show that it is done with cold water rather than hot water."
Aluminium moka pot put through dishwasher and then polished - would it alter taste?,"As you suggest and note in your question, and it deserves repeating: That said, while unsightly, it should not be harmful to use after going through the dishwasher. You should thoroughly wash by hand no matter if you polish or not; you should remove any leftover polish, aluminum oxide, dish detergent, or any other residue (also suggested by Ecnerwal in a comment on the question). Polishing is possible with acids or metal polishes, but will probably not provide more than temporary, cosmetic benefit. That is my experience when trying to ""restore"" accidentally-dishwashered aluminum: I washed it thoroughly, and I continue to use it in its tarnished state. I couldn't find a really good reference about these recommendations; here's a discussion on Chowhound with some reasonable information; many more by searching ""dishwasher aluminum"" or similar. Some suggest strong chemicals and abrasive scouring pads; I personally wouldn't use these for fear of further damaging the pot. My personal pick is to use a stainless steel moka pot, affording a little more margin for error on cleaning. That said, aluminum models heat quickly and certainly do look classic and classy."
What is this tamper/filter thing that came with my moka pot for?,"OK, I've worked this one out. This little thing is called a reducer. What you can do is put the reducer into the funnel. It should sit on the indentation half way down. You then put coffee on top of it. This allows you to make less coffee with a larger pot. However, although I haven't tried it yet, it seems that most people complain that the quality of the coffee reduces (!) significantly. Many complain of a weaker brew. It's probably better to use a smaller pot if you regularly want to make less coffee."
Will using teabags in a Keurig cause problems?,"It will not damage the machine; However, it won't brew properly.  Your tea is supposed to steep inside the water for a set period of time; but the Keurig will simply pour water quickly through it, resulting in extremely weak tea. So no, it won't damage the machine, but you will not brew your tea correctly."
What are some strategies for handling the transition between different-aged beans in a coffee shop Espresso grinder?,"You will just have to find some form of compromise. I think the best way would be to empty the Hopper and then fill it with the new beans (also sometimes you might want to switch up the espresso?). You should figure out how your grinder behaves once it's getting more empty and with this knowledge you can quite easily adjust the extraction such that the quality will not decrease too much. The most likely case is that the dose will decrease slightly. You could put a scale next to the hopper and if you feel like your espresso is running faster, check if the dose changed because the hopper is getting empty and adjust your grinder accordingly. I think checking the dose and grind occasionally throughout the day is a good way to up your espresso game in any case. It helps me learn a lot about the coffee and setup. There's tons of variables, like humidity and temperature that will change the behavior of the grinder."
What purpose have those grooves inside the dripper?,"These grooves are for improving the flow of coffee through the filter. The grooves create space between the filter and the cone to permit little channels for the coffee to flow into the vessel after passing through the filter paper. I think the ridges also help ""wick"" the coffee away from the filter paper, helping the filter paper drain better.   If the ridges are absent (as in Chemex cones, for example) the brewed coffee sometimes wells up between the filter paper and the cone. See also this question and my answer that compares the two styles of cones.  As for the shape and location of the grooves, some are spiral-shaped, others are straight, staggered, etc. I don't notice any advantage of any style as long as they're present, and I suspect the shape and location is purely aesthetic or marketing, not significantly different in any functional way.   EDIT: this article from Serious Eats suggests that the grooves additionally help ""keep water distributed evenly among the bed of coffee grounds."" Presumably this is related to the drainage I mention above, but was a more-legitimate source than my theories above, so I wanted to include."
How does sugar influence the taste?,"Sugar adds a sweet taste to coffee, not a sour taste.  Sourness and sweetness are rather separate tastes! Different flavours will to some extent interact with each other, and individual preference and taste have something to do with this, but there are particular causes of certain flavours. Sourness is a perception of acidity. In high enough quantities, sugar can overwhelm the perception of acidity (e.g., cola has a pH ~2.5, but doesn't taste sour because the perception is overwhelmed by sugar/sweetness; see also this Seasoned Advice question on sugar reducing perception of sourness). I don't see how sugar could be the cause of sourness (i.e., sugar is not acidic). EDIT: That said, it might be the case that this is a temporal situation. Sugar reduces the perception of sourness, but it could be the case this change is temporary: For example, if the sweetness (sugar) dissipates more quickly than the sourness (acids), you might be left with ""more sourness than sweetness"" in the aftertaste after some time. That is, you're left with ""un-maksked"" residual sourness which, though present all along, is more perceptible after the sugar has dissipated. However, all of this is entirely speculation; I have no justification for this, and haven't found any supporting information. Sweetness is perceived by the presence of sugar (and/or other chemicals that happen to interact in similar ways with sweetness perception). Sugar will also impact mouthfeel. Bitterness is separate also; see this question on salt and bitterness in coffee. I don't think there are any chemical changes to the sugar happening in this case."
Is it safe to brew old coffee?,"If it's refrigerated, it'll last for at least a week, as long as you didn't pre-dairy it.
  Unrefrigerated, I wouldn't trust it for more than a day. Coffee is a crappy growth medium        and it should start out the next best thing to sterile, but, even covered, its going to start to get moldy.
  Obviously if you add dairy, then you're dealing with that dairy shelf-life, and that isn't very long at all. First, is your idea of going bad that it has a funny taste and is not as fresh as it once was, or is it that it actually tastes as though it is spoiled? Yes, coffee can go stale when it comes to taste, but it wonât actually be spoiled or dangerous to drink. Once your coffee is opened and introduced to oxygen, the shelf life timer begins to tick. Storing coffee in hot, humid, or sunlight areas will only make matters worse. The best way to keep your coffee fresh is to store it in a container that is air tight and will remain cool â but not in the refrigerator. Do you typically buy your coffee ground for you? With a far greater surface area of coffee coming in contact with the oxygen, those grounds are going to stale much quicker than whole beans will. I highly recommend investing in a hand or electric grinder to experience the fresh taste and aroma of beans youâve ground yourself. When coffee goes bad, it can become bitter and even rancid. Every bean will react differently to oxidation. If you start to notice your expertly roasted beans losing quality and general yumminess, it may be time to buy some fresh beans. Donât know how to find amazing, fresh coffee? I wrote a guide on that. No matter what you do, you will not be able to get that fresh flavor back once it has left the bean. The most important thing to do is keep it locked up tight. However, if you are a true coffee lover, it may not sit around long enough to even think about going bad. Just remember this rule of thumb: about two weeks after roast the coffee will start decaying. I would close this question as ""Too broad"" but then.

Getting large volume lattes,"Assuming you are not planning to buy a lot more machinery, you can simply use the Nespresso to make espresso - depending on your preferred strength, two to three shots should be what you need for your 20 oz mug. A Starbucks âVentiâ is named for the twenty oz volume and contains three shots.  But that's basically a puddle in your mug:
You need to fill the other 16 oz. and you do that with steamed (foamy) milk. If you wanted to do this ""correctly"", you would use the steam wand of your espresso machine - which the Nespresso doesn't have, I presume.    The milk-to-foam-to-espresso ratio is up to you, find what you like best. I suggest starting somewhere at about two thirds milk / one third foam plus three shots and tweak your drink until you find your preferred recipe. For more inspiration, see this answer over at Seasoned Advice."
Is there a difference between a manual and an automatic grinder?,"The most important differences I think, are time and temperature. I really don't know much technical details about grinders, but as @luser-droog said, friction will create heat and it will affect the coffee (so, motor grinders can be affected by this if doesn't manage heat dissipation well) And of course, in all cases, time matters; so, time might be a crucial factor for someone. "
What is a good recipe for high quality coffee beans that are no longer fresh?,"One option is a somewhat obscure preparation method, but one that works best with older-ish beans: Nel drip (nel pot) preparation recommends beans that are a few weeks old; here's a Nel preparation guide from Blue Bottle. I don't know why older beans are recommended, except perhaps tradition.  See also other questions tagged nel-drip including another question of mine on Nel. "
Home roaster cleaning and/or seasoning,"The roasting chamber of your Gene Cafe is made of Pyrex (heat-resistant tempered glass), and leaving the old oils to accumulate and burn will cause the the inside of the drum to turn black. The darker material will likely change your roasting time, and the fouled glass will not allow you to monitor your roasts. Glass does not need ""seasoning"", so it should be cleaned regularly per the manufacturer's recommendations.   Seasoning is typically a way to create a stick-resistant coating on a porous metal surface (like cast iron or carbon steel). When a thin layer of fat or oil is heated on these surfaces, it forms a polymer which provides rust protection and creates a non-stick surface that will keep whatever you are cooking/roasting from reacting with the cooking surface (the juju you mentioned above).  If the roasting chamber were made of cast iron or carbon steel, seasoning would be recommended. But neither glass nor stainless steel need seasoning, and you're just changing the built-in characteristics of your roaster.  To keep your roaster in optimal roasting condition, keep your glass roasting chamber clean."
Why does the filtrate sometimes well up in the upper cone when using the Chemex coffeemaker,"Science! What follows is my bogus hypothesis, with pictures (annotated in the conventional style) and annotations to bolster my unsubstantiated claims. Other (non-Chemex) cone-style (and basket-style) filters often have ridges down the inside of the cone. It seems that these ridges serve two purposes: to provide channels down which the coffee can flow, and to help ""wick"" the coffee away from the filter. This seems to help the coffee drain faster. This is probably due to properties of water like cohesion, adhesion, surface tension, and perhaps capillary action (legitimacy of these claims is left as an exercise to the reader). Contrasting the two types of cones:  between a ceramic cone filter (white, left) and the Chemex cone (glass, right). I think the ridges prevent the ""wells"" from forming.  With a flat surface (like the Chemex), the filter somehow ""seals"" itself against the side of the cone, restricting the flow of coffee well enough to cause the pooling you describe. I assume this happens because the grounds get packed solidly at the bottom of the cone, and perhaps expand slightly. I don't have a better answer for ""why"" this seal happens. Lifting the filter (as you describe) breaks the ""seal"" and permits the coffee to drain. Another way that I sometimes resolve the issue is to slide a bamboo skewer (or stir-stick, or chop-stick, etc.) between the filter and the Chemex cone (careful not to tear the filter!). This seems to work by providing a similar ""ridge"" that the other cone filters provide; it prevents the coffee-pockets from forming next to the skewer. I have also tried to fold little ""pleats"" in the filter, but it's annoying and doesn't work all that well. I find that this ""pooling"" happens more often when I use a finer grind. I think a finer grind packs itself down more in the bottom of the cone and clogs up the filter more quickly. Both of these could believably cause the ""sealing,"" but I don't have any other real evidence. It also drains more slowly in other drip brewing methods also. For these reasons I use a coarser grind when using the Chemex than when I'm brewing pour-over with the ridged cone filter. In fact, the Blue Bottle Chemex brewing guide suggests a much coarser grind than regular filter coffee, like that of French press. Maybe that's for the same reason. The pour-spout on the Chemex helps with this a little by allowing steam/air to escape from the bottom chamber. A pre-wet filter can sometimes slide down into the pour-spout and nearly seal it, which will also make it more difficult for the coffee to drain, but it sounds like that's not what's happening in your particular case."
What's going on inside a Nespresso capsule?,"Well, as you have yourself conclude that they have no difference regarding the amount of coffee (6 g). I just gonna put there an important note that some people miss. Espresso capsules are made to be extracted as espressos and lungos, as lungos. The point of this is that Nespresso's lungo coffees are supposedly designed to have a more balanced flavor over a longer extraction/more diluted in contrast to the espresso which was made and evaluated to be drink in a single, stronger shot. As for myself, I had both ways already and I do believe that at least for the espresso capsules, stick with espresso size (especially if you are using a 3rd party capsule). Nespresso's lungos are often too watery, in my opinion."
Portafilter difficult to turn,"As your question is very open I will try to answer two common roots of your problem. 1) Too much coffee. Per cup of espresso it should be 7g of ground beans. 2) No ""tamping"". You probably did not compress the powder in the porta filter (called tamping). This is what it looks like:  So maybe you compressed it when you tried to place it in the machine. "
Does using two paper filters in a drip machine strengthen flavour?,"Yes, because it allows more time for coffee to be extracted as it stored in a longer time for coffee to drip. However, other parameters also have effect regarding this issue (such as, type of bean, roasting profile, temperature, brewing method)
But using double filter since it also filter the ""flavor"", making it stale (you may lose the pleasant acidic, fruity flavor, or other unique flavor your bean may offered) and double filter can make your coffee over extracted thus unpleasant bitter flavor. 
If you want your coffee strong you may want other experiment Use different kind of bean You may use robusta, it naturally has more ""caffeine"" compared to Arabica, therefore can ""hit"" you harder Use different kind of roasting profile the darker the roast, the bitter it is, but it has less caffeine. when brewing In the end it comes down to your preference(s). No single technique is right for everyone. Enjoy your coffee immediately after brewing My explanation might not answer your question directly, double filter affect your coffee, yes it is. But other factors simply can be neglected"
Other uses for espresso machines?,"It may completely be abuse of the machine, but I saw someone clean stainless steel jewelry once in an ECM machine. They put the jewelry in a sealed portafilter basket and backflushed the machine with cleaning detergent. It seemed to clean the jewelry pretty well, but I can't say if it would be very different from putting it in the dishwasher. At the very least, it seems to be a way to kill two birds with one stone when backflushing your machine."
What's the big deal about pour-over coffee?,"Pour over systems give you the ability to control the water flow through the coffee grounds with a high level of precision whereas a drip brewer does not.   I will admit, this is a bit of a trend, but there are very real differences in the taste of a pour over versus a drip brewed cup of coffee. All this being said.. I still use a drip brewer for my morning cup of coffee because I'm usually running out the front door trying to get to work.  Does my drip brewer produce a good cup of coffee?  Absolutely.  Can I get a better cup of coffee with a pour over?  Probably.  It's simply a quality / time trade off."
Are there health risks to eating coffee?,"No.  Not any substantial ones. There are several listed questions around the topic of eating coffee beans.  Ingesting roasted coffee beans without grinding/brewing them in some manner is quite common.  Many companies sell them specifically to be consumed this way.  Probably the main associated health risk would be caffeine overdose.  However, it's roughly the same as simply drinking far too much coffee.  The main difference being that since coffee (brewed) takes up so much more volume, you are likely to become physically uncomfortable from it before you could get to dangerous levels.  With coffee beans you could likely get to dangerous levels much easier since it would be possible to eat many more beans before experiencing the same ""fullness"" effect. "
Is it safe to give decaf coffee to a child?,"You may find similar discussion mostly on the health tag. The most relevant question was previously closed on Coffee SE site as it was opinion-based. Let me add my opinion here: my 2.5 years old niece drinks regular (not decaf) Turkish coffee together with us during her daily routine. Caffeine's effects are similar in adults or in children. And they are more or less the same. However, children have smaller and more sensitive bodies. So, we let her drink really small amounts. She becomes happy to be a part of the family. I can say, everybody in our family grown up like that for generations, none of us experienced caffeine-related problems. (Still, we are not MDs and we are a very limited sample set. This is a coffee board, not a medical opinion body.) The other related questions may arise, but relevant to adults: As children are more sensitive, every little effect must be considered seriously. Still, I believe, if observed carefully, it should be safe to drink a bit coffee for a child."
Student friendly coffee?,"Many factors are at play here. 
I assume we are talking about morning coffee and not about something that helps to pull you through the night of studying.
So, the easiest (minimal amount of work in the morning) would be a drip coffee.  Definitely an upgrade from instant.  Many of machines allow you to preset the wake up time, so that you prepare everything at night, and then you wake in the morning to a ready cup (or two) of coffee waiting for you. If you actually care about taste and want something that won't just give you a kick in the head, but actually be a pleasurable experience - buy real whole bean coffee, and grind it yourself.   As to a way to make coffee - that is a purely opinion based question. Some people love espresso. I like my french press.  Some love their morning cappuccino, etc.  You have to experiment and find your drink of choice. 
But the first best thing you can do, is to buy a whole bean coffee and grind it yourself.  The taste difference (specially after an instant coffee) will be enormous! Good Luck in your coffee adventure! "
How do I know how hard to tamp my coffee?,"Each new bean becomes a bit of an experiment with each new machine you use. A rule of thumb is to grind just enough to fill the portafilter so the beveled edge of the tamper becomes flush with the edge of the portafilter using about 15kg of pressure. A crude diagram: But how much coffee that is, and just how much over 15kg you need to apply in order to tamp that much coffee to get the right pressure to pull a great shot is a matter of science that you'll need to do. You might want a finer grind instead of more pressure, you have to experiment. Start with your usual espresso grind setting, a dose appropriate for the size of the filter you're using and then work from there. You can get grinders that auto tamp for you based on your settings, so when you hit that 'eureka!' moment, you can reproduce it somewhat reliably using the same equipment. For home use? Just be ready to experiment with the first few filters full when you get beans you haven't tried before. There's no real 'rule' here, other than you want as much coffee as you can get in the filter with the tamper sinking flush given about 15kg-ish of pressure. It varies wildly from there."
Why am I not addicted to coffee?,"Caffeine is only mildly addictive and only shows minor physical dependence. It does not threaten physical, social or economic health the way truly addictive drugs will.
""Withdrawal"" or skipping your morning cup might give you a mild headache.
Here is a link to a brief description of caffeine addiction. http://www.m.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/caffeine-myths-and-facts"
Should I change my coffee drinking habits when using braces?,"Coffee should be fine (unless you've heard otherwise from your dentist or other health care people of course!). There should be no additional concern about coffee, e.g., its acidity or temperature (other than normal caution).  There are some foods to avoid, but I don't see coffee or anything similar on any list of foods to avoid; here's a few curated lists: In general, the recommendations are to avoid hard foods (e.g., crusty bread, ice cubes, popcorn) or sticky foods (e.g., gum, hard candy, caramels), and to be careful of sweets in general (which can promote tooth decay in general but can be more difficult to clean-out with braces.) If anything, take less sugar with your coffee! Otherwise, continue to enjoy your coffee. "
What variables cause the Gesha/Geisha coffee varietal to be priced so highly?,"Geisha is so pricey because of a lot of marketing true. However it is extremely difficult to grow.
On a farm is Costa Rica this past June the farmer was having a difficult time with his because the root system is not as robust as other Arabicas.
Another reason for the price is that the yields per bush are lower. Here is a good article on it: Geisha Coffee According to a 4th Generation Panama Producer"
French Press: Fine Grind!,"A fine grind, especially an espresso grind, are usually avoided when doing immersion brewing methods. Reason being that their extraction times are so low that is usually not practical to press a fine grind coffee. Though this isn't a direct answer to your question, I'd recommend grinding your coffee directly before brewing. This is best practice, and it means you can grind your coffee to whichever coarseness that you need. If you want to french press this coffee I think it would be best to adjust your extraction time. If you're using an espresso grind I'd do a short bloom, then extract for 45seconds.  To eliminate fine grit, wrap a paper coffee filter over the strainer, and press immediately to achieve 45second extraction, as there will be more resistance with the added filter. If the coffee is sour or bland increase extraction time. If the coffee tastes too bitter, then try decreasing the extraction time. Bloom for maybe 8 seconds. It's hard to tell, most people press coffee because they like pressed coffee, and they'll usually use a coarse grind for this. Using a fine grind will likely negate the benefits of using a press pot, and could very well be impossible/very difficult to consistently get a good cup."
Can I use an espresso blend with an aeropress?,"The answer is quite simply: It's up to your personal preference. Lots of things make a good cup of espresso; some people like (or think they like) single origin expensive marketing-buzzword-infused coffees, and others have found other roasts / blends that work just as well for them. You can use whatever you want in your aeropress to make a cup of joe that suits you. As this question on Seasoned Advise suggests, there are some objective measures we might look at. Since and Aeropress (disclaimer, I don't have one, but I have used them while backpacking quite a lot) tends to extract a lot of flavor, a medium roast will probably prevent your coffee from being too dark, and still provide a lot of flavor. You'll also want a nice fine grind, which is generally what you want for any espresso machine."
What sort of sugar to add to coffee?,"Yes, it makes a difference to the taste. As for what to pick - what you like. My favorite is ""Vermont Coffee"" - ie, use maple syrup (or sugar, but syrup is more cost-effective, at least near a production area where the cost is not much shipping.)  Friends in the UK introduced me to Demerara, which is a not-quite fully refined sugar with a delicate carmel taste. Some of the ""raw sugar"" products sold in the USA approximate this, and some better than others.  At times I use USA brown sugar, which is basically white sugar sprayed with molasses, and not nearly as delicately flavored as a result. Plain old white sugar is what it is, and if that's what you want, that's fine too. I certainly have no difficulty distinguishing all of these from each other, in coffee - your taste buds/nose may vary. Grain size affects only speed and ease of dissolving. Particularly in summer I tend to keep a bottle of 2 sugar:1 water simple syrup in the fridge for easily mixed, pre-dissolved sugar (not just for coffee.)"
Difference between inverted and normal aeropress?,"The differences are minor, but there are differences.  When brewing normally, water begins to drip through the paper filter immediately when poured over the grounds.  After stirring I usually have to add more water after the bloom recedes.  Inverted, all the water stays with the grounds until you flip it over and start extracting.  The extra water added with the normal process is hotter, and I believe will tend to over extract bitter notes more easily, not only because of the higher temperature, but by virtue of the added volume of water passing through the grounds. Inverted, however, the volume of water is less, and because of that, the temperature of that water will be lowered a bit.  You can extract quickly, or wait as long as you want to extract the coffee.  Additionally, I have seen it claimed that with the inverted method, oils that will rise to the top of the column will be forced through the filter first and flavor the coffee more than with the regular method where they tend to get trapped in the grounds.   I have gone back and forth but always seem to go back to the inverted method. It provides more control of the variables and for me gives a better flavor, even when using the same beans, same roast, same water temperature.  Your mileage may vary of course.   "
Why do some grounds float and others sink when brewing by pour over,"Bean density varies dramatically with roast level.  The more roasted a bean is, the less dense it becomes.  My guess would be that less dense beans would have more of a tendency to float and more dense beans would have a tendency to sink.  However, I imagine that there are other factors as well.  Grind size would affect the mass vs surface size of the grounds and have some say as well.  Age could also be a factor since freshly roasted beans still contain/give off some amount of gas.  That degassing time can also vary with roast level and bean variety, so just time since roast may not always be a consistent measure.  Overall I'd guess there are four plus factors affecting the ""float"" of your grounds.  And that's not to even say anything about the content of the water itself. "
How should I start a coffee export business?,"As another dimension, I see a few trends that you might wish to consider. Just a perspective from a ""consumer"" standpoint. "
Make my coffee stronger without equipment,I see only one possibility to make your turkish brew stronger and that is using more coffee beans per serving. You are using boiling water and long extraction time so almost everything from the coffee gets extracted leaving you this only option to make it stronger.
Are the last drips after pulling an espresso less tasty?,"It's not really the pressure, that's just timing. It depends on the beans and roast; your comparison point is the first few (after pre-infusion) drips that came out. The last ones are always going to be weaker and quite possibly more acidic because the puck is both drained and saturated at the same time. It's drained of oils and flavors, and saturated with hot water.  Whether or not you can actually detect that difference should it be added to the rest of the shot is a matter of uncertainty, hinging on your sense of taste and the type of coffee used. If it's a dark-roasted robusta blend then you might be able to detect a slight almost 'metallic' or slightly salty flavor, but you'd need an extremely acute sense of taste. The water you use also has a lot to do with this. It can sometimes be easy to get caught up in what is probably happening, even if you (or most) can't really taste it. If you get more satisfaction out of your coffee because you've managed to improve the taste even just a tiny bit - then great, and keep doing it, because that's what it's all about. Just be critical and test for yourself, with your setup, and your beans :)"
Is it easier to froth full-fat milk?,"The short answer is yes. The absence of the milk fats means that the foam will not ""coagulate"" as easily. The proteins chains in milk are polar: one end of the chain is
hydrophilic (attracted to water), and the other is hydrophobic
(repelled by water). Because milk is mostly made up of water, as soon
as those proteins unfold, exposing their ends, the hydrophobic ends
immediately try to get as far away from that water as possible. If you
were to look at a single tiny bubble in a cup of foamed milk, you'd
see that the hydrophobic ends of the milk proteins are all pointed
inwards, towards the water-free interior of the bubble, while the
hydrophilic ends stay put in the aqueous environment the bubbles are
suspended in. This structure helps keep the air bubbles intact for a long time after the steaming > process, all the way into your cup (and into your happy, soon-to-be caffeinated mouth).

What is the limit to the amount of coffee one can consume?,"Let's look at this from the worst case: The LD50 for caffeine is around 150-200mg/kg body weight for a healthy adult or 10g1. The caffeine content of a ""cup of coffee"" (however you define it) varies with beans, roast and preparation method, but according to Wikipedia, (50-)75-100 cups of drip coffee get you in the lethal ballpark. (More caffeine math on this site.) This is an amount of fluid that you can't ingest without other severe complications, but deaths by pure caffeine, e.g. in tablets can happen. If you don't kill yourself, the next serious outcome is caffeine intoxication, caused by single doses of about half the LD50 or 400-500mg: The symptoms of caffeine intoxication are comparable to the symptoms of overdoses of other stimulants: they may include restlessness, fidgeting, anxiety, excitement, insomnia, flushing of the face, increased urination, gastrointestinal disturbance, muscle twitching, a rambling flow of thought and speech, irritability, irregular or rapid heart beat, and psychomotor agitation.[95] In cases of much larger overdoses, mania, depression, lapses in judgment, disorientation, disinhibition, delusions, hallucinations, or psychosis may occur, and rhabdomyolysis (breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue) can be provoked.[99][100]
  (Source) Everything else is a question of your metabolism and caffeine tolerance vs. desired and undesirable effects. For example: coffee is a stimulant that counters fatigue and drowsiness - and thus can keep you awake if it's not metabolized when you want to sleep. There is no general ""safety threshold"", but if you look at the recommendation of both the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the UK Food Standards Agency for pregnant women, the 200mg caffeine per day deemed safe for them2 should be more than safe for every other healthy adult.  1 Sources vary between 5-30g, but LD50 rates for humans aren't exactly a field of much experimentation. 2 Pregnant women show a decreased caffeine metabolism (up to 15 hours vs. 3-4 hours in non-pregnant women) and there is a large safety margin to protect the unborn child."
"What was the cause for the current overwhelming popularity in the brighter, more acidic coffees?","I think there are a number of factors influencing the current situation. This is not to say that dark roasts are bad.  But they have partially been given a bad rep by large chains who are using them to maximize profit, and not flavor.  Home and microroasters now also have unprecedented access to a HUGE variety of beans that years back would have been out of reach.  This means that companies can cheaply distribute very high quality beans with extraordinary flavor profiles when roasted at a lighter level.  "
Cheese and Coffee,"I've never heard of cheese and coffee pairings, but I've had coffee that has very wine like qualities. Personally this sounds like it would amount to gut rot, however if you try some lighter roasts or preferably profile roasted beans from areas in Kenya, Ethiopia, Rwanda, they tend to have very wine like qualities. Single origin, profile roasted beans typically have very renounced flavors, and profile roasting typically roasts the bean lighter preserving the tannicy, floral, and somewhat wine like qualities in the bean. It might be prefered to eat the cheese with a cold coffee. If you cold brew coffee it tends to bring out the wine like qualities more so than hot brewing. A common method for this is often called ""dutch coffee"", where cold/iced water slowly drips over grounds into a vessel over a long period of time. As far as dunking the cheese in the coffee. I'm not so sure about this. I mean there are a lot of cheese out there. As far as anything salty with coffee, I generally think the tastes conflict. Personally I don't dunk anything in my coffee, and when it comes to wine & cheese tasting you don't dunk the cheese in the wine. Perhaps a light cheese that isn't salty would work well dipped in coffee. I'm thinking somewhere along the lines of a soft cheese, but a soft cheese itself wouldn't be easily dunked into coffee. You could try spreading Mascarpone on a biscotti and dipping that. Even a porous cheese is unlikely to absorb and carry the taste of coffee. Cheese and coffee aren't exactly a pair made in heaven, but I can see it working much like you said, like wine and cheese. However dunking the cheese in the coffee gives me a bad taste in my mouth. Like I said there are some soft cheeses(usually those used in desserts) that I could imagine being dunked in coffee in some manner, but this is more like a dessert with coffee, which makes me think of a traditional italian 4 course meal which usually ends with the ""dolce"" or dessert which is often accompanied by espresso. Italy typically also uses soft cheeses in their desserts. Tiramisu, which is very well known, is actually a combination of cheese and coffee. However, like I stated the food and the coffee typically remain separate, unless the coffee is an ingredient in the food. I think what you're trying to do is interesting, but I'd avoid making your wife a test subject. I'd recommend keeping the coffee and cheese separate. However, they can absolutely be consumed in the same sitting, but I don't imagine the actual tastes meld together well in the same mouthful. If she wants something to dip in her coffee, biscotti is a common choice, and if she wants cheese, try spreading some mascarpone on it. You can have fun with different biscotti variants and fold things like chocolate, fruits, etc into the mascarpone. I come from the renowned cheese state Wisconsin, and I've been a long time coffee enthusiast. This title definitely struck interest."
What am I supposed to do when coffee shop leave some coffee beans in my latte,"You should eat floating coffee beans, will add extra caffeine and also beneficial antioxidants and nutrition compared with just the drink. On average a coffee bean does contain 12mg of caffeine, adding that to your drink will not change flavor but will just increase overall caffeine content.  Is like chocolate-covered coffee beans treats, get enough caffeine from a snack.  On average, eight coffee beans provide an equivalent amount of
  caffeine as one cup of coffee. Your body absorbs caffeine from whole
  coffee beans at a quicker rate than that from liquid coffee.  coffee beans benefits"
How to make cold brew concentrate?,"Like @Shiri said in comments above (and hopes that I'm not answer-sniping), most recipes for cold-brew are concentrates. Within reason, try brewing with a smaller amount of water! Compare guides like Kicking Horse, Stumptown, Blue Bottle. In my experience (except for the problems that I've had with filtering) brewing a lower volume of water generates very similar results when diluted. Said the other way, brewing with a higher ratio of coffee :: water, then diluting, is my preferred way of brewing, storing, and consuming. That said, do store in a neutral vessel that is easy to clean (my preference is a wide-mouth glass jar). Stored in the fridge, it will last several days (maybe a week) and still taste okay. In a plastic jug (or so) it might 1- start to obtain bad tastes from the container, and 2- infect the jug with stale coffee taste over time. Coffee oils (etc.) can be hard to remove especially when cold. Some additional information is in related questions are about ratios and concentration and a concentration table in this answer."
How bad is coffee for your teeth?,"A recent study published in Letters in Applied Microbiology suggests that coffee can break down bacterial plaques that form on teeth. These studies were done in a lab on extracted teeth, using moderate amounts of coffee on lab-grown plaques formed by bacteria from saliva. Antibacterial effect of coffee: calcium concentration in a culture containing teeth/biofilm exposed to Coffea Canephora aqueous extract,
Letters in Applied Microbiology, Volume 59, Issue 3, September 2014, Pages: 342â347, N. Meckelburg et al. Coffee can stain teeth. Is that a health issue? It's often listed with other dental health issues but I'm not sure why.  The acidity of coffee may wear down teeth over time, but it's not a prime suspect. The acidity of coffee generally falls somewhere between that of pure water and cow's milk, according to one article. Fruit juice and soft drinks are far more acidic (pH < 3). Coffee is only slightly more acidic than saliva. There is no shortage of articles claiming high acidity of coffee but 
a pH of 5--a plausible average--is not very high. There are probably hundreds of studies in English alone on the effect of coffee on dental health. In terms of acidity it's not as bad as juice and not as benign as water. The plaque-preventive effect is something new to consider. There is also a 2012 study by the American Cancer Society suggesting that coffee lowers the risk of oral cancer. Those who drank 4+ cups of coffee a day were about half as likely to die of oral/pharyngeal cancer as those who drank occasionally or not at all. Coffee, Tea, and Fatal Oral/Pharyngeal Cancer in a Large Prospective U.S. Cohort, American Journal of Epidemiology, Dec. 2012 (online), Hildebrand et al. To the extent that oral cancer is a dental health issue this is also something to weigh.   Science doesn't necessarily furnish a simple answer. It appears that the mildly corrosive effect of coffee may be offset by a tendency to reduce plaque. If coffee helps reduce the risk of oral cancer one could argue that, overall, the benefits of coffee for dental health outweigh the risks. "
Why does espresso taste different to percolator coffee?,"Espresso tastes different than percolator coffee, but not necessarily better.  Espresso extraction produces a more concentrated drink with a different set of compounds that you would get with percolator extraction.  With a shorter extraction time and higher pressure, espresso will have a slightly different set of compounds than you would get from the same coffee with percolation.   Some people prefer a more concentrated taste, however, some do not (many people think espresso is ""too strong"" when drank straight, thus the popularity here in the US of mixed espresso drinks).  This doesn't mean it's necessarily better.  Some types of beans are not well suited to espresso extraction and will actually produce a better cup when brewed with other methods.   All coffee can be benefited or hindered by brew/prep method, but the quality of the bean and it's roast have quite a bit of influence in the matter.  Badly grown, processed and roasted coffee will not magically be made better by espresso extraction.  It might actually end up worse because concentrating it can highlight it's flaws."
Moka Pot Buildup,"Due to the fact that the spots are picking up the colour of the coffee, it sounds to me like they may be scales from minerals in the water being used. This is normal occurrence for almost every type of coffee maker. In daily use, do not use soap and water to clean the pot. This is because oils from the coffee will build up in the pot and contribute to the flavour of the coffee for each concurrent use. Just rinse with warm water, let it dry, and put it away. If you don't use your Moka pot daily, these oils will build up but become rancid over time. If you don't use your pot daily, it's a good idea to give it a scrub with soap and water every now and again. It seems that your Moka pot may have some hard mineral deposits, called scaling, inside the pot. There are multiple ways to descale a coffee machine. You can use a vinegar solution, lemon juice solution, or you can even buy coffee descaler from some supermarkets. Recipe for lemon juice and vinegar solutions: OR Notice: Don't boil these solutions as the fumes can cause damage to your eyes and respiratory tract. If your flavour is still affected after you descale it, you may be dealing with some rust. If you happen to notice any rust inside or your coffee just has a strange taste after some amount of time and many brews, you may need to consider getting a new one. Good luck. If you have any questions, feel free to post them or comment here."
Peaberry and coffee varieties,"My findings are that it's actually exactly the same.  Peaberry beans occur in almost all coffee in some percentage.  They aren't grown separate, they are the exact same coffee that's been sorted out of the processed beans so that the lot looks more homogeneous and sells better.  I've actually been lucky enough to at one time have peaberry, oversized and ""regular"" beans all from the same lot.  The coffees all tasted exactly the same to me.  I have a friend that claimed he tasted some difference in in the larger beans, owing perhaps to not having been roasted as thoroughly.   The beans I had were Sumatran Toba Batak, sold in sorted lots of 17+, peaberry and regular.  I am sure that almost any processing station you went to in the world could do such processing if they chose, although it's probably labor intensive and would add some cost to the beans.  If Tanzania is doing it regularly, they have probably found it's financially worth it.  On occasion when I look closely at the beans I am roasting, I'll usually find a few peaberries in the mix."
How do I judge the quality of 'green' beans?,"I have been purchasing everything from cheap beans to rather pricey beans and what i discovered while buying the more pricey (and higher quality) beans was that the fragrance of the bean is somewhat stronger and can actually smell of more than just the usual grassy fragrance. Notes from fruits and nuts are not unusual and could be a indicator of somewhat higher quality coffee. I have no scientific proof of this, and while even expensive coffee can be bad, it is my empirical approach to determine what could be a step up in coffee quality. Apart from that i have to admit that its hard to determine the quality of the bean before it has been roasted."
What does Fair Trade guarantee?,"If you mean the coffee bean farmer by 'end-producer',
Fair Trade guarantees a relative increase of the contract that the farmer can negotiate.  Say, for example a farmer gets USD 20,- for his entire crop usually, then He might get USD 140,- for the same amount of beans when selling to a Fair Trade contracter. 
Also see: How much do the farmers get about prices in Ethiopia."
How quickly does ground coffee get stale?,"I can say, by experience, that it's not a superstition. Maybe not seconds, but for sure it's just a few minutes. Maybe someone could find a reference to an experiment or I may encounter and add it later. But, you can easily observe it by your nose. The aromatic components are the source of the flavor in coffee beans. When you ground them, you crack them fine. The components get free and start to evaporate. That's why you can smell them. However, we want to taste them so badly. So, we need to trap then into the water as quick as possible, before most of them evaporate. Below is a nice chart that shows how quickly coffee goes stale when it's stored as whole beans. Ground coffee, I assume, would be similar, but so much quicker as the surface area is greater for evaporation this time. When does coffee go off?"
What is the most expensive coffee in the world?,"It is true, that Kopi Luwak is one of the most expensive coffee bean. The process to achieve specialised coffee is long and they are risks of failing is very high. Thus, it makes it more expensive. Read ref below to understand more. There are some beans that are produced in Penang,Malayasia are very expensive but they taste out world(honestly). When enquired about it they say because it is freshly farmed and brewed. I believe that because around that cafe, it was all coffee and other farms. History of Kopi Luwak Penang Coffee"
How are caffeine pills made?,"Caffeine is almost always created as a byproduct of the decaffeination process. It IS possible to synthesize caffeine. The most popular lab synthesis (1,3-dimethylurea and ethyl 2-cyanoacetate) requires multiple steps, and generally more steps means more expensive.  Luckily, there is a huge demand for decaffeinated coffee. The bonus is exactly as you expected; these processes generate both decaf coffee and caffeine as a by-product, that can then be repackaged or sold in other products.
Historically, decaffeination was done with organic solvent extraction (chloroform and dichloromethane being really common), but today is is usually done with the swiss water process (I suspect this is what ends up in pills and added caffeine consumer goods) or supercritical fluid extraction (which is more energy intensive, but can lead to a higher quality product that is often purchased by laboratories and scientific researchers who use it as part of their experiments)."
Is there a way to economically store freshly roasted coffee under vacuum?,"Yes, there is a way to store freshly roasted coffee - or even store bought roasted beans - at home under vacuum without expensive equipment.  I drink wine and have collected a couple of wine storage devices over the years that I no longer use.  One of these is a bottle stopper with a one-way valve in the top and a vacuum pump for removing the air from a partially consumed bottle of wine.   My idea was to clean out the bottle and fill it with freshly roasted coffee beans, then use the vacuum pump and stopper to apply suction to the bottle to encourage the carbon dioxide to exit the beans without worrying about oxygen making the beans go stale prematurely. I've found that the beans emit enough carbon dioxide gas to require re-pumping the bottle for the first day or two, but after that it will hold a vacuum indefinitely.  I've added erasable labels to the bottle to record the type of roasted beans I have inside.  Two standard wine bottles will hold about 610 grams of roasted beans, or about 700 grams of unroasted beans, which is 7 batches in my SR 500 roaster.  These are Ethiopian, YMMV. "
How much does the shape of the drinking vessel change the flavor?,"According to my ""Lavazza Barista Guide"" the shape of the cup affects the foam of the espresso and indirectly affects the taste. It is explained as; the foam helps to protect the valuable ingredients to not to be evaporated easily. Also, the foam keeps you espresso warm while you are not drinking it. In the guide, it is stated that the thickness and the vertical angle of the lavazza cups are specially designed for best coffee experience. So that, at each sip you drink some of the coffee and a bit of the foam and the remaining part of the coffee and foam fits to the now norrower part of the cup. This sounds like a bit advertisement and a bit reality in a manual prepared by a commercial company. Quite expected in my opinion."
What you call the original Cappuccino?,"It's made from 3 equal parts Milk foam (top)
Steamed milk (middle)
Espresso (bottom) as illustrated (bottom left) on this image designed by Lokesh Dhakar...  There is also some details here, however it does not describe the important split in foam and steamed milk. For a 3-ounce macchiato, use a 2:1 ratio of espresso to milk; for a
  6-ounce cappuccino, 1:2; and for an 8-or-more-ounce latte, 1:3+. As to the second art of your question, a cappuccino with more or less milk would not be a cappuccino by definition. However would it taste better, that's down to your personal taste and how much you like foam. Personally for me, it would become more a desert ;)"
How to fix burr contact/alignment issues on an OE LIDO hand grinder on fine grinds?,"For the LIDO grinders, burr drag, grinding, or touching is likely due to misalignment. Misalignment is more likely an assembly issue than a manufacturing issue since the burrs are machined. This means you can fix your Orphan Espresso LIDO on your own, with some handiwork and know-how. When I received my Lido E, the burrs would contact each other at anything tighter than +3.5 on the adjustment ring. After careful realignment, I got down to -5 from ""factory-zero"" before any contact, fixing a misalignment of over eight notches! -5 is now my new ""recalibrated zero"". My burrs are now much better centered than when it arrived, and I can get them extremely close together while keeping them fully free spinning. Orphan Espresso's LIDO Maintenance Video is a detailed guide on how to disassemble, clean, and reassemble your LIDO. He only goes as far as to approximately realign the burrs. In Orphan Espresso's LIDO Grider Burr Alignment Video, he focuses on burr alignment, going more in-depth. The video is very informative, but I believe alignment can be improved further with these additional steps: To Perfectly Align LIDO 2, LIDO 3, or LIDO E Burrs If done correctly, the burrs will be so well-centered that when tightening the adjustment ring until first burr contact, the burr contacts in two or more (or all) places at once. The point of first burr contact is your new ""recalibrated zero"". What this is doing The alignment video shows how to align the inner burr and outer burr before screwing in the alignment screws. The problem is that I found the burrs can still get misaligned during tightening of the alignment screws. My procedure addresses those last 1-2 turns of the alignment screws, between ""lightly"" and ""fully"" tightened. Slowly tightening whilst rechecking alignment makes sure that everything stays aligned even as the screws are fully tightened."
What's the recommended method for heating cold brew?,"The best result I got was warming up in a bain-marie. No science here---just my trials... I believe for now that bain-marie preserves more flavours and ""respects"" the aromas. Heating cold-brew coffee was surprising to me the first time. Such unexplored flavours with the exact same beans I use for drip, etc. I hope you'll enjoy, and explore for more questions here!"
Brewing 900 Cups of Coffee (In 24 Hours)?,"Your problem depends more on the shape of the data than the raw quantities. 900 cups in 24 hours is one cup every 40 seconds or so, which isn't so bad, however I doubt that's the distribution of actual orders! I'm going to assume all of your 300 guests want to have a cup of coffee during a one-hour period. This works out as 5 coffees a minute, or one every 12 seconds. I'm ignoring factors of manpower, cost etc., and focussing on coffee preparation only :-) You can get 12-cup french press pots very easily, and probably larger ones. Assuming each one takes ~6 minutes to cycle (prepare, brew for 4 mins, serve, rinse), meaning you can serve 2 people a minute with one pot. 3 pots would allow you to serve 6 people a minute (amortised) and serve 300 people in an hour. A few more pots would make it very comfortable. Assuming you're grinding the coffee fresh, you'll get a far superior brew from this than perk coffee that's been sitting there for 20 minutes. So serving people fast enough shouldn't be too hard, but boiling water fast enough might be, and for that you just need an urn, with which you can keep a large enough supply of boiling water to just fill up and go."
Is preparing instant coffee a brew?,"I'd agree with you.  There isn't a brew happening because the solution was already created.  What you are performing is a rehydration.  However, ""let me rehydrate some coffee"" is a pretty awkward turn off phrase."
"How can I emphasize the sweet, fruity notes of my coffee?","Lighter roasts are going to have more of these flavors but it obviously depends on the bean as well. If all you are going to change is the method of brewing the coffee, I would recommend making sure you don't use too hot of a water temperature and trying to use a pour over. I find pour over allows for more delicate flavors you are describing, rather than something like aeropress which can approach more espresso type coffee."
How are coffee beans differentiated?,"It is important to have in mind that altitude is not the only feature that allows one to differentiate the coffee beans. Temperature is perhaps even more important (altitude influences in the temperatures suffered by a coffee plant, but not all the same altitudes mean the same temperature profiles). As a brief summary (taken from [1]), we can say that: So, the main factor is the species of coffee. The elevation and temperature only tell you what of the varieties of these species you can successfully grow and how you can harvest it. According to this source [2]: The Effect of Altitude on Coffee Flavor, that relates only to the Arabica species, can be summarized as follows: As a more specific summary: This other source [3]: Bean Basics: Planting & Growing Coffee deals with how altitude affects the planting and harvesting of coffee tree, not about its features.

Is rate or consistency of flow related to quality when pulling a shot?,"A more watery/lighter consistency with a high flow rate is going to leave you with a terrible tasting shot of espresso with too light of crema (this foam on top can tell you a lot about a pulled shot even if it does look as if it came out OK). The opposite applies here to, a super dark and slow pouring shot can occur too. In my 4 years of coffee house experience using professional grade equipment it all came down to the grind size. You can tell just by the way the shot pours out. If it's quick make the grind a little finer, if it's slow make it a bit more coarse.  And also depending on the temperature in the room can effect the pulls as well, half way through my morning shifts I would have to adjust the grind. "
Does my coffee pot need to be fixed?,"If you could be more specific with your question it would be easier to answer.  For example was your previous ""pot"" a percolator or automatic coffee maker or what?  By the same token, what is your current set up?  By a process of elimination you should be able to isolate the factor that's causing your coffee to taste sh***ty.  Basically those are: If all the factors except the method of brewing are accounted for, then the problem is in the brewing method, which would include the coffee maker.  If you know it's clean and it still tastes bad, you need a different brewing method.  Depending on how much coffee you drink, there are lots of options that will yield good coffee.  I have found that the simpler methods (i.e., French press, AeroPress, pour over) are the easiest to control and therefore give you the best chance of getting a good result.  They are also cheaper and easier to keep clean.  Brewing good coffee is actually pretty straightforward so don't give up!"
Are coffee 'vaults' like Friis really effective?,"So there are a fair few, well, questionable claims on that page, and some downright contradictions: One Year of Friis Freshness Valves included, to vent freshness damaging CO2 gases CO2 gasses are not 'freshness damaging'. CO2 is, to all intents and purposes, inert in this context. The only gas you really care about when freshness is concerned is Oxygen. Also, a well-designed valve shouldn't wear out. It's not like a filter that gets clogged over time, it's just a mechanism. Air-Tight Storage Air-tight with a valve? It's either air-tight, or it has a valve... What this product is, is a well sealed and opaque container. It will likely perform no differently from any other well sealed and opaque container."
How do I know when to stop pulling my shot?,"I generally judge when to stop my shot based off when blonding begins to occur. This is when the espresso changes to a noticeably lighter, yellowish color. At this stage, only bitter flavors are being extracted from the coffee, and any more extraction will only degrade the flavor of your shot. It takes a bit of practice to notice blonding, and can be made more obvious by using a bottomless portafilter. I also suggest using a stopwatch to determine how long it takes before blonding occurs, so you can see how consistent the rest of your process is. "
What machine is Caffe Vergnano using to make my coffee?,"Elektra Belle Epoque P1C:  See this page: http://www.elektrasrl.com/belle_epoque_2grel_cr.php You can still buy these, they are very expensive of course, I don't think there is anything particularly special other than the design and finish: http://www.elektrasrl.com/belle_epoque_details.php The home version is this one: http://www.elektrasrl.com/fam_retro_1grsa_c_a1c.php  Which will set you back over 1000 English pounds: http://www.myespresso.co.uk/product.php/27/elektra-mini-verticale-semi-automatic-espresso-machine---chrome You may be wondering how come I answered this so quickly, it is because I have also been to the very same cafe you showed, the one on shaftesbury avenue, and was intrigued myself. The finish of the machine is hand made so it takes time for one to be delivered to you. I don't think there is anything particularly special about it but one of the nice things is the internal covered area for storing and warming cups. The internal guts are no different to other modern espresso machines."
Where can I go to find importers?,"The first recommendation would be to go to a Chamber of Commerce or a Board of Trade locally and to make a request to help with the contacts of potential importers. Quick googling directed me to website of the Chamber of Commerce in Ethiopia: http://www.ethiopianchamber.com/ The Government of Ethiopia also hosted World Coffee Conference, so you may find additional information on event, and may be some useful contacts to start with.  The second option would be to get in touch with biggest Coffee Associations or to participate in coffee conferences/shows:"
What temperature to froth hemp milk to?,"I would follow the same guidelines as cow milk when using any alternative milk. For one you really just can't taste a liquid that is scalding hot, so you might as well not go so toasty. Other than that - If you think it tastes great, then keep doing that. If it smells less sweet, it probably is less sweet - you just gotta find that perfect sensory sweet spot. I generally aim for about 135F if it's a drink being consumed on site - otherwise about 145 togo. Hopefully this helps!"
Coffee brewed without filter taste less bitter and sour?,"I'm not exactly sure if this is accurate, but I think it has to do with flavor extraction.  When you brew with a filter, the water is going to fall through the grounds too fast to actually develop good flavor. Sure, you'll get coffee, but you're only giving the water enough time to take the more bitter tastes with it. I have this same problem with my coffee. When you brew directly into water, all of the water is in contact with all of the grounds for a considerably longer amount of time. The water will extract the bitter tastes AND the more flavorful aspects of the grounds, which is why you thought this tasted better. It wasn't just bitter, it was bitter and flavorful, and that's coffee. You're not doing anything wrong with the filtered methods, it's simply a matter of opinion among coffee tasters. Some people enjoy the convenience of fast, filtered, and bitter coffee because it's what they know as coffee. The reason the Turkish method isn't suggested is because, the way you describe it, it sounds like the grounds stay inside the coffee, and many people loathe having to deal with that--even though it produces much better coffee. So no, you're not doing anything wrong; however, the reason you're finding flavor differences is that the extraction of flavors is far different between the two methods!"
How and when is flavoured coffee flavoured?,"This site seems to suggest that the best time is just after the beans are roasted and still warm and ""open"", which makes some sense.  However, it does state that many flavorers cold flavor the beans and simply add more flavoring oils to make up for the reduced absorption.  I can't think of anyone that would flavor the beans before roasting.  Not only would the high heat of the roasting risk degrading the taste of the flavoring oils, it would also affect the roasting process and flavor the roasting equipment. As for distribution, I believe most of the flavoring agents are fairly potent and the process is a sprinkling or pouring then mixing, and not a soaking."
Why did my instant coffee turn dark and hard?,"The most sensible solution is to throw it out.  Instant coffee is hygroscopic, it will absorb moisture from the air if possible. I guess either someone was sloppy when scooping out the instant coffee and used a wet spoon or the container was not airtight (either bad packaging design or because a careless user didnât close the pack properly). Now add high humidity to the mix and you will get the lump as seen in your post. There are at least three reasons1 to discard this container. A) Itâs a pain to pry it out and to dissolve it, as you have already observed. Pouring hot water straight into the container may help, but then thereâs: B) The flavor is almost certainly not pleasant any more (see 1).  C) But the most important factor is food safety. If the granules got humid, there is a certain probability of bacterial and/or fungal growth and I would really recommend to discard the (ex-)coffee. I wrote more about food safety considerations in this post, explaining the FAT TOM principle of food safety. ââââ 1 There are some coffee snobs that would claim that instant coffee per se is disgusting enough to throw away, but we wonât go down that road here."
why does coffee make some people sleepy?,"Disclaimer: I'm not a physician, so here are only guesses based on my experience. Besides coffeine, there are other substances to be taken into account, plus some non-chemical effects: Sugar and milk by themselves can have relaxing effects. It is a well known fact that sugar can induce sleepiness, and hot milk is often drunk before going to bed. I've started drinking black coffee (no sugar) after lunch because of this. Milk and coffee together are particularly hard to process by the stomach. This can bring a sort of after-lunch drowsiness. There may be a psychological effect related to the assumption of coffee, or any other drink that is associated with relax and calm in your mind.  Warmth can have a relaxing effect by itself"
Best filter to use for cold brew?,"I find the very same problem with cold brew taking a long time. Though we have a few Q/A about this in the cold-brew already, I think could stand on its own! I use a ""two-phase"" method: using first a ""primary"" or ""coarse"" filter, like a French press plunger as described here and elsewhere, or a metal mesh tea or coffee filter as described here, or even a sock or cloth as suggested by this question. This strains through quickly, but only filters the larger particles that would very quickly clog a paper filter. Second, I put it through a paper filter (I find Hario-style filters drain faster than Melitta-style filters). I find this works the best of any setup I have used. For completeness, we have a few Q/A about this already. See for example making cold-brew easier for some more ideas about ""pre-filtering""; see starting out and equipment for some other tips; and even try cold brewing with AeroPress."
Do I need higher pressure to create a ristretto?,"Typically, a ristretto is an espresso shot pulled with half as much water. If you assume a normal shot is 30ml, the only practical difference in pulling a ristretto is to stop the extraction at 15ml.  The coffee grind, quantity and pull pressure should remain the same. Regardless, if you feel as if the shot is taking too long, or coming out too fast, you could try adjusting the grind before adjusting the pressure, which should be trickier."
What is essential for a proper tamp?,"There are a pantload of recommendations on tamping, but the one recommendation common to all is... practice! And... The most optimal way of tamping depends on every individual pull: the beans (freshness and grind), your skill, machine, etc. at that moment. Ultimately, the goal (and most important part, in my belief) is to pack the grounds uniformly. Any non-uniformity in your puck will allow water to flow more through certain areas than others, giving you non-uniform extraction across your grounds (some over- and some under-extracted). For example, if your tamper isn't level, you'll end up with a ""slanted"" puck; if your grounds are packed more loosely in some places than others... these can yield un-even pucks. That said, here's a few other common recommendations, some of which you mentioned in the question: Then there's some controversial bits: A few articles on different takes on tamping: "
What causes the mouthfeel from a French Press?,"More of the oils in the coffee remain as opposed to being filtered out. The coffee sits in the water, nothing is filtered out. The plunger leaves the oil in the coffee and prevents the grinds from going into the coffee cup (unless you used a very fine grind in which case the fine particles will go through the filter)."
Does pre-heating a puck on the group head produce more crema?,"Well, I've heard a lot of ""pro tips"" and advice having worked around espresso machines for a few years. And I must say, this one is new. I have never heard of warming the coffee itself. I can't imagine that, at the temperature at which the brew head usually resides, many significant changes are made in just a few moments of warming the coffee. The closest I've heard to this is that some believe in the opposite. A fellow once told me to leave my spent puck in the portafilter if someone was going to be brewing again shortly. He claimed this helped retain heat in the portafilter. Though the science checks out, the results proved marginal and pretty much just made you the lazy guy using the espresso machine. So, in closing, I'd say that the effects of warming your coffee are probably negligible, and that you can get more crema more easily through other means (buying better quality coffee, adjusting your brewing variables, etc)"
"How to make thick, Indian style coffee without using instant coffee?","Just like you described it. Add water a little by little, then took a spoon and swirl it. Then repeat, maintaining a thick paste, it will start to have a creamy colour. The most important thing is DON'T ADD TOO MUCH WATER until the paste is ready (you will know when), then it's ready to fill your cup with water and drink it (it will have a lot of cream, basically created by swirling and aeration). Just try it and then repeat next time if it doesn't go as you want to."
What is going wrong with this Espresso shot?,"I don't think anyone can really give a definitive answer to this but I'd like to chime in to try to help. It's almost impossible to find your answer because of how many different variables are at play here. You should first focus on minimising the variance in your methods. Compare shot times as a secondary to consistent output weight and see how grinding finer in the shop would fare. Higher boiler pressure does not necessarily point directly towards higher temperatures. Also, higher pressures could impact the puck suddenly when the valve is opened which could crack and cause channeling and therefore underextraction and sourness. Your main issues here are still in point 1. Weight difference is purely by choice. Crema production is mostly dependent on freshness of beans and less to do with specifics in extraction method. If preset weight quantities are being used as part of a single button-press on a machine, then your problem starts there. You need to weigh every shot and choose when to stop the shot yourself. Without this control, you're simply relinquishing responsibility of the shot and you are at the mercy of the machine, yet another variable to consider in being able to find the right shot. In conclusion, you MUST minimise variables. Make sure your grind sizes are the same at both locations, ensure your input and output weight are identical, analyse differences in taste and extraction time at same output weight, ensure your sources of water are identical, make sure your tamp pressures are the same. At this point the only real differences will be the machines and then you can start investigating how each machine is affecting the shots. Try to use bottomless portafilters in order to diagnose whether your distribution of your coffee bed was poor and whether channeling occurs during extraction. Combine all of the parameters above with the taste of your output shots and you'll know the next steps you need to take in finding the problem in your shot."
"Is there a difference in taste between bleached, unbleached and natural fibre filters?","This could depend on the brand of filters and the brewing method so it's worthwhile (and fun) to do the experiment. I'd love to see results from more experimenters. Bamboo vs. Paper Filters:
I did this experiment. We only had three tasters but the results were statistically significant at the 5% standard -- all three of us could taste the difference. The bamboo filter made sharper coffee (analogous to sharp cheese) while the paper filter made smoother coffee. We did not all have the same preference between those two batches. Filtering out Diterpenes:
According to the AeroPress FAQ question ""DO YOU RECOMMEND USING A METAL FILTER IN THE AEROPRESS?"": We were originally planning to include a metal filter with each AeroPress but when we conducted blind taste tests comparing paper filtered AeroPress brewed coffee with metal filtered AeroPress brewed coffee, the paper filtered coffee always won. We also learned using a paper filter is healthier because it removes diterpenes from coffee and diterpenes are potent agents that raise your bad cholesterol. Q. Does anyone know if bamboo filters similarly remove the diterpenes from coffee? Are bamboo filters made from a combination of paper and bamboo fibers?"
What Factors Influence Crema Production In Espresso?,"I hereby copy a very nice statement from the conclusion of Illy & Navarini's survey paper: Most of the data reported in the present review may suggest that espresso brewing can be described as âa quick way to transfer carbon dioxide from roasted and ground coffee to a small cup by means of hot water under pressureâ. This then leads to the facts that for espresso coffee, carbon dioxide has to be: generated by roasting maintained in the bean by proper packaging maintained in the ground coffee solubilized in water released into the beverage. In this framework statements such as âany error in grinding or in percolation, in temperature or extraction level, has an immediate effect on denounced by the color, the texture and the persistence of the foamâ or âthe foam is the signature of a well-prepared espressoâ can be well justified. In fact, foam volume, persistence, and consistence are the consequences of the carbon dioxide content originally present in the coffee. In addition to the importance of carbon dioxide in espresso coffee foam, we believe that carbon dioxide can play a role even from a taste point of view. Therefore; you need to find fresh nice Arabica beans, roast properly, degas for the correct amount of time, grind them well, brew appropriately with decent water right after grinding. Note: Please see this discussion for the use of the percolation in scientific papers. It simply means brew."
"Why do aeropress columns get abrasions, or scars, near the top?","However I cannot understood the scars definitely, I would like to offer a solution to the scars I thought: There is a possibility that coffee grounds may stick to the rubber ring and scratch the plastic column when pressure is applied as they stay in between the rubber ring and the plastic column. Still, these scratches do not affect the performance of the gadget if they are not large enough to leak. Easiest way to clean the grounds is rubbing the surface of the rubber ring by your finger under warm water for a few seconds. Edit: After I see the photos, my guess is, these scars are caused by the scratches first, then the polished surface of the plastic is peeled off by heat. I assume you may continue to use it without problems. For other people with brand new aeropress, my previous advice still holds: try to wash away residual grounds off the rubber ring."
How many plants are needed to brew a cup of coffee?,"It all boils down to three questions:
1) Yield = How much did you get from the grounds?
2) Strength = How much ended up in the cup?
3) Ratio = What did you get there? Yield: Yield pertains to how much soluble you took from the coffee grounds. Ground coffee has something between 27-30% of its mass being soluble, that is, stuff you can dissolve in water. If you kept boiling and boiling coffee grounds in water, eventually youâd get everything that the grounds have to give. Above 22-24%, however, and youâve essentially reached too far or squeezed too hard, because unpleasant flavors will emerge. Below 18%, and youâre not getting enough out of the coffee, at worst, leaving the coffee with underdeveloped flavors or simply wasting coffee. So it sort of answers the question, âHow much did you get from the grounds?â Strength: Pertains to how much of the final brew is coffee, and how much is water. SCAA Golden Cup says 1.15-1.35% brew strength is a desirable zone to the most number of people, though we espresso-lovers tend to like a bit moreâ¦ something like 1.3-1.5% brew strength. Over 1.5, up to 2.0% or more, and youâre in the âheavy, thickâ coffee zone. Simply put,âHow much ended up in the cup?â Ratio: Simply, grams per liter. It provides one of the major answers to the question that Yield and Strength might ask, that is, âHow did you get there?â Perhaps the most easy-to-remember ratio is 60g/L, or 60 grams of coffee for every one liter of water. The fact that you can make a balanced, pleasing, delicious cup of coffee at 60 g/L should give any barista pause when theyâre finding that theyâre using 80 grams or more per liter when theyâre making coffee. Is it âwrongâ to make coffee at 90 g/L? Noâ¦ but is the additional 50% of coffee yielding an additional 50% of coffee quality, compared to the barista down the street making superb coffee at 60 g/L? For the assistance of common men like me,
 Then, to clarify the actual number, if Arabica then 1 - 1.5 pounds per cycle and if Robusta 2 - 2.75 pounds. And then you can calculate the rest. ;) Sourced from http://portafilter.net."
Is there a method to make flavored coffee without syrups?,"I believe there are several ways to make flavoured coffees without syrup or sweetener. For example, I make vanilla coffee by mixing fresh vanilla seeds with finely ground medium-roast coffee, and seal the mixture for some time (duration depends on the weather). The result is quite nice, with a slight touch of vanilla. This is not a product---just for personal use and still exploring. The difference with syrup or essence or flavouring is that the touch feels lighter and more natural. A basic mechanism here is to mix ground coffee with some spice, and let the mixture sleep for flavour to spread. Another mechanism is to put some spice directly in a container with roasted beans. This seems more appropriate for spices like cinnamon (no need to extract seeds like for vanilla). I have not tried to mix spices with green beans, as the roasting stage changes a lot of things, but that should be an interesting path."
How should I vary my steaming technique to create the correct ratios of steamed to foamed milk for the drink I wish to create?,"You're on the right track for good foam by keeping the tip of the wand close to the surface. To end up with less foam, submerge the tip as the temperature rises and the hiss drops to a whisper; I usually dip down after the first 15 or 20 seconds or so for a latte, longer for a cappuccino. When you hear milk ""screaming"" in coffee places, that's the sound of a submerged wand in cold milk. The result is milk that tastes flat and has little or no foam. As long as you keep the wand near the surface until the milk warms up and quiets, you can experiment with time and depth until you're getting the results you want."
How can I maximize cold brew yield without harming flavor?,"It generally depends on your brew ratio (# grams of coffee to # grams of water) some people go with 1:6, 1:7, etc.  And keep in mind the higher your ratio is the less concentrated the coffee will be, so for example if you brew 140 grams of coffee at the 1:7 ratio you would need to add about 980ml of water which would produce a larger yield than it would if you used the 1:6 ratio, but the later one would be more concentrated.  I also saw some people that use a lower ratios then dilute the yield with water to make it less concentrated. "
How to reduce sourness in my moka-pot brew?,"What I immediately notice is that you say the entire brew process takes only 5-10 seconds. Even for a 1-pot moka, this seems way too fast. Vary some other parameters:"
Does eating a cookie created using coffee beans has the same effect as drinking coffee?,"No, because there is no fluid in the cookie.  Eating a coffee cookie will have the same effect as eating a roasted coffee bean.   Virtually no caffeine will be lost during baking, unless you bake hot enough to burn the cookies.  Caffeine's melting point is 460F (237 Â°C).  That is well above what your cookie will reach internally while in the oven.  "
Low wattage K-cup type office machine,"Well, I don't know anything about keurig, but as the question has gone unanswered so far, I'll give it a try. From my experience with electronics, there are 3 ways how a low power mod could be done, depending on the details. The first is to mod the power supply to the boiler (e.g. put an inductor in series) and hope the machine's software can cope with this. Second: If you do have to modify the software (and are able to; replacing the controller and reimplementing the software may be required) you could implement a pwm regulation of the heating (your power line got to survive short overloads of ~0.1s) Third: The boiler has a too small heat capacity for a full cup and needs to draw full power during the pouring of coffe (my machine does this when it has to make a large cup). You have to change the boiler (bigger one might be too big for the case), and then continue with one of the steps. Note: If this can't be done in the fashion of âthe nerd in the next cubicle does it for free coffe and no one is ever to talk about the modâ but you have to employ an external firm and need to match safety regulations, you are almost definitely cheaper off by upgrading the power supply to the office."
Whats the purpose of preheating a coffee roaster?,"Preheating your Gene Cafe lets you choose between life cycle of the roaster and roasting consistency.  By preheating your roaster, you should be able to get more consistent roast times.  In my case my garage is sometimes 50F and sometimes 80F, so a preheat cycle would certainly probably help.  I don't do it though.  Any machine has a finite number of cycles, and you are shorting that window by preheating your machine. I roast one and a half pounds a week (a half pound for work, and one pound for home).  The half pound is always done by itself from a cold start.  When I do the pound for home, I do two half pound batches, the first is from a cold start and the second is done immediately following on a ""preheated"" machine.  I try to aim for the same roast level on each of the batches and the second one consistently needs less time to reach the same level.  I generally set a timer and come back 14 minutes after the start.  This allows me to fine tune the last portion of the batch, on cold batches I generally add a bit of time, and on the preheated ones I end up subtracting a bit (to get the same roast).  I am fine with this as it saves me a cycle and will prolong the life of my roaster.  However, I can see that some folks would want the roast length of two such batches to be much closer to the same at the cost of that extra cycle.  For them it may make sense."
What are the differences between Jacobs KrÃ¶nung and Jacobs Cronat Gold?,"Jacobs Cronat Gold is smoother and more mild than Jacobs KrÃ¶nung Instant coffee.

No idea about the cost difference though. Sourced from http://www.enjoybettercoffee.com/"
Is there a universal label for the sustainability impact of a specific coffee product?,"There is no universal label though there are various labels for coffee sustainability. You can't really have an universal label as each of the labels have their own standards which have to be met and various coffee farms and producers follow certain ones. For example, in the Huffington Post, it mentions some of these labels: USADA (or simply USDA): This is basically the United States' label for organic for various products (i.e meat and fruits) that is not limited to only coffee. It is quite strict (has certification agencies, checks for criterion not only during production but also distribution and packaging) as it Aims to promote and enhance natural soil activity and cycling of resources, which helps to create a rich and fertile substrate for the crop and maintain ecological balance by prohibiting use of artificially produced (synthetic) agrochemicals. As mentioned by @avacado1, there is an European equivalent to the USDA, which is the EU Organic Program (note that the EU doesn't cover all of Europe). Source Some companies like Starbucks have their own labels that guarantee their standards for their coffee: C.A.F.E. (which stands for Coffee and Farmer Equity) evaluates the economic, social, and environmental aspects of coffee production in order to ensure that Starbucksâs sources of coffee are sustainably grown. Starbucks collaborated with Scientific Certification Systems (SCS), a third-party evaluation and certification firm, to develop the guidelines for the program. Rainforest Alliance Program: This is a more ""natural"" certification since: With this program, coffee is grown on farms where forests, rivers, soils, and wildlife are conserved and workers are treated with respect, paid decent wages, have proper and safe equipment, and are given access to education and medical care. Bird Friendly Conversation: This label ensures that the coffee farms support the native and migratory birds that come over for a visit: The Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center (SMBC) gives this certification to farmers in order to promote shade-grown organic coffee plantations that can play a key role in the conservation of our global environment and of migratory birds that find sanctuary in these forest-like plantations. So as you can see here, the various labels not only have various standards and goals but have their own area jurisdiction as well, each trying to gain support based on what they are."
Does anyone know the history of the âwashed process?â,"The washed process in coffee has a rich history that traces back to regions known for their coffee cultivation, such as Ethiopia and Central America. It emerged as a response to the need for cleaner and more consistent flavors in coffee beans. The process involves removing the pulp and mucilage from the coffee cherry before drying, resulting in a focus on the inherent flavors of the bean itself. Over time, the washed process has developed and progressed through various stages of refinement. Initially, it was a relatively simple method involving pulping the cherries, fermenting them, and then washing away the residue. This helped reduce the risk of defects and inconsistencies in the beans' flavors. As the coffee industry evolved, so did the washed process. Coffee producers began experimenting with fermentation times, water quality, and drying methods to fine-tune the flavor outcomes. The goal was to bring out unique taste profiles while maintaining the clarity and brightness associated with the washed process. Different regions have also adopted variations of the washed process. For instance, in Ethiopia, the birthplace of coffee, the process has deep cultural roots. The Ethiopian ""washed"" method involves fermenting the beans in water, which gives rise to the renowned fruity and floral flavors characteristic of Ethiopian coffees. In Central America, where the washed process gained prominence, variations emerged based on local practices and environmental conditions. Some producers focused on extending the fermentation period to enhance complexity, while others employed controlled fermentation tanks for precision. As specialty coffee gained momentum, the washed process took on new dimensions. ""Honey-processed"" and ""pulped natural"" methods emerged, combining elements of both washed and natural processes. These variations aimed to strike a balance between flavor clarity and the fruit-forward qualities associated with natural processing. In summary, the washed process has evolved from a rudimentary method to a complex and versatile approach in coffee production. Its development has been influenced by the pursuit of consistent flavors, regional traditions, and the desire to showcase the unique attributes of different coffee varieties. This evolution has led to a diverse range of washed process variations that continue to captivate coffee enthusiasts worldwide."
Is it possible to grow plants in used coffee ground so that they get coffee flavor?,"Adding coffee grounds to a planting medium (e.g. soil) adds fatty acids, essential oils and nutrients that enrich soil which can help the growth of the plant and it may also affect the colour. One thing to be careful of is that some coffee grounds increase the acidity of the soil. However, I can't find anything indicating that it will affect the flavour of the plant. So, by all means, grow your plants in coffee grounds, but don't expect any difference in flavour."
Does a decaffeinated coffee have zero or little caffeine in it?,"We have yet to invent a process that removes 100% of the caffeine. When drinking decaf, the important question to consider is how likely you are to feel the effects of the trace amounts of caffeine that are left. That brings us, as most things do, back to the beans. Arabica has (on average) only half of the caffeine that Robusta contains. Now let's say you have a bag of Robusta where 80% of the beans have 1 - 2% of their original amounts, and 20% of the beans have 15% of their original amounts. Drop by drop, a shot of Robusta is much more likely to keep you awake or elicit other natural responses to caffeine than an identically-sized shot of Arabica. But let's take that into context and not pick on Robusta so much - the single shot we mentioned might only contain 20mg of caffeine in total, meaning you wouldn't notice the effects any more than you would notice effects from the Arabica. The point is, you could, so if you want to avoid caffeine, go with the milder bean and faster extraction. Just goes to show, when you're talking about the characteristics of any coffee, the bean is pretty paramount - it can change the answer to any question completely in many cases."
Are there any recipes for coffee+whisky?,Irish Coffe is a very famous one. Read more at: Original Irish Coffee from Food Network.
Why does French press not give enough 'Caffeine Effect'?,One of the reasons I like my French Press is because of the caffeine boost. One simple answer to your question is to add more coffee grounds. But aside from the type and amount of coffee used there are several things that will influence the caffeine level of your coffee. One of them is the size of the ground. You need a ground big enough that it is filtered out but not so big that the water doesn't completely extract the oils and caffeine. You might try different grind levels and see which one works best. Another thing you can do is increase steep time. If your grinds are just a bit too large perhaps a 6 minute steep would work better. You will have to experiment with the grind and steep time.
What's the minimum recommended age for drinking a coffee? [closed],"In short: there is no minimum recommended age for drinking coffee, but on the other hand it's not good idea to have kids drink coffee all day long. It is discussed in depth in the parenting site of Stack Exchange and the top answer thee states: The bottom line is that caffeine is generally safe, but it does have significant effects in children as well as adults. Note that children are much more likely to encounter caffeine in a soft drink than in tea or coffee; that's what you have to worry about, I think, not Starbucks. A cup of green tea contains ~15-25 mg of caffeine, which is around the limit where there were no noteworthy affects for a 50 kg child, so if they want to hang out at a cafe, they don't even have to limit themselves to strictly caffeine-free options Personally I'm not going to allow my children to have coffee before they are in highschool - that's the age where they can start to decide on things affecting their health."
"Does a percolator make ""better"" coffee?","First things first, you should decide if it's better than any other brewing method, or not. Decide your cup by tasting and experimenting. (By the way, it's unclear what you mean by ""regular brewer"" in your question. According to my experience, there's no regular way of brewing coffee.) I'm not a fan of percolators. However, l can add a few objective things on percolators. Actually, you should understand how it brews as a first step. The water in the container boils, gets through ground coffee, drips over the container again. Therefore, you can fine tune brew time. You may brew for a short time for mild coffee or brew longer periods for intense cups. There are nice schemas of how it works in Wikipedia. You may also want to see similar questions on this site just like: "
What factors contribute to differences between coffee beans?,"As has been mentioned, the species of coffee makes a difference. There are something like a hundred different species, with Robusta and Arabica being the most common commercially grown by far.  Liberica is another species that is grown in small quantities and has a very distinctive taste. Within a single species such as Arabica, there can be a huge number of varietals. Some are naturally occuring (such as Bourbon and Typica). Maragogype (""elephant bean"") is also a naturally occuring mutation from Brazil. Others have been bred by research institutes. For example SL-28 and SL-34 are common Kenyan varietals.  Another famous varietal is the ""Gesha"" (sometimes romantically but incorrectly called ""Geisha""). This came to light when an estate in Pananma ""La Esmarelda"" noted something interesting when they were cupping their coffee. By separating their harvest, they finally identified a small section which was contributing to the overall cup. This coffee went on to dominate the Cup of Excellence competition and set a world record price at the time. It's since been planted on other farms which brings up the next point..... As has been mentioned, things like altitude, soil and micro-climate affect the taste. So the Gesha (or any other) varietal from one farm won't taste exactly the same as Gesha from another farm.  The way of preparing the green beans - washed, dry-processed, or a number of other methods, all have their effect on the final flavour. So even the identical cultivar harvested from the same farm but prepared differently will produce different flavours. (The difference between dry and wet-processed is very signficant.) The actual care taken during preparation is also hugely important - I suspect that if one is starting out with a decent high grown bean, this is what really separates speciality coffee from the mass produced stuff. It takes a lot more care to prep the coffee carefully. And I haven't even mentioned roasting and brewing.... I think this is what makes coffee so interesting - there is so much variety to try and enjoy."
Does sweet coffee exist?,"This question is probably best answered in two directions: If you feel the need to add sugar to your coffee, it may simply be that the coffee that you are drinking is not very good. Sugar makes a lot of things taste better in addition to the sweetness that it adds. There are many ways to improve the quality of your coffee, like buying better and fresher beans, grinding right before brewing instead of buying pre-ground coffee, etc. Whether any of that is feasible depends on your coffee drinking circumstances - e.g., if you need to use your office's drip coffee machine with the coffee bought by the kitchen management, there is not a lot that you can do. If you want to add sweetness because you like it sweet, but you still want to avoid adding sugar for some reason, you can try the following: There are a couple of coffee bean types that have a slightly sweet flavour. For example, I have a some ""Starbucks 2015 Christmas Blend Espresso"" here, which is described by the producer by ""Cedar and herbal spiciness with an intense caramelly sweetness"". When using the beans in a pump-driven espresso machine, the espresso indeed has some sweetness. But don't expect too much. Coffee is natually low-calorie, which means that there can only be a little bit of sweetness. There are some coffee types that are naturally sweeter than others. According to a book that I have, lightly roasted Arabica Bourbon coffee beans should have a ""fine sweetness"". Panama Volcan Baru Coffee is also listed as particularly sweet. Against, don't expect too much - ""particularly sweet"" means in comparison to other beans! In case you prefer to drink your coffee with milk, you may want to switch to lactose-free milk. In that type of milk, the lactose has been split into shorter sugar molecules, which makes the milk taste quite sweet without a noticeable change in calories. "
Should coffee be regulated?,"Generally, governments find it necessary to regulate addictive substances due to quality of life or health issues that stem from abuse/addiction. While I will neither support or attack this kind of reasoning, when you think about children born addicted to heroin or methamphetamine, the property crimes generally associated with addiction, and the additional strain on our health care system, you can begin to at least understand it.   Coffee addiction is far less financially taxing (my dependence costs me roughly $10/week or less), less likely to disturb my health in any appreciable way, and socially acceptable at all levels of society.   The coffee industry generates plenty of revenue for government as is.  Starbucks is paying their taxes just like every other corporation.  Creating an additional branch of government employees to regulate or adding additional employees to an existing administration (FDA perhaps?) are all expenses to regulate something that isn't currently a problem.  So it's an expense without any appreciable benefit.  TL;DR  Since coffee is a low impact and highly supportable dependence, government has little or nothing to gain by regulating it's use.     "
Best stories of coffee consumption in historical times? [closed],"A story often shared as the origin of coffee consumption is that of Kaldi and The Dancing Goats, which comes out of Ethiopia, the birthplace of coffee. Kaldi was a herder who discovered his goats would become rambunctious after eating the berries and leaves of a plant. That plant turned out to be the coffee plant. Upon observing this, Kaldi also partook of the plant's berries, finding it gave him extra energy. Some claim people would crush the berries and mix them with animal fat into rudimentary ""protein bars"". Eventually they began drying-out the berries and steeping the seeds (beans) in hot water to brew the first coffee to grace the Earth. Thus begins the storied history of coffee consumption! Another anecdote relating to coffee involves Pope Clement VIII. His advisors urged him to ban the consumption of coffee, likening it to the ""Devil's brew"" as it was popular among Muslims. However, after tasting coffee for the first time, the Pope was so impressed he couldn't bare to think of outlawing it. It's said this led to the spread of coffee drinking among Catholics and Italians in general. This story should be taken with a grain of salt, as whether or not Pope Clement VIII actually said or did what he said, or whether or not his advisors ever broached the topic is a matter of speculation. That said, there are many more stories surrounding the spread and popularization of coffee. I'll let others add their own stories, as I know there are many more out there :)"
Coffee on daily basis,"Coffee and in particular caffeine, has had a reputation of being bad for your health, possibly being associated with cardiovascular disease, stroke, and your heart health in general.  Current consensus is that there may actually be some health benefits from drinking coffee, and those that drink moderate amount of coffee (3-5 cups) have lower risk with these particular issues. A couple of things to note, these results have been found to be associated with black coffee, not including the effects of sweeteners or dairy added to the drink.  These additions may have other effects stemming from the sugars they add to you beverage. Also, some evidence has been found linking coffee prepared in a method that does not use a paper filter (e.g. french press) with increased cholesterol levels.  "
The pricier the better? [closed],"Short answer: Yes - up to a point Long answer:  Ignoring things like Kopi Luwak etc, there is a cost associated with growing, harvesting and transporting arabica beans in a timely manner, roasting them while they're fresh, and getting them to somewhere you can buy them. If you go below this price, corners will be cut. You may get cheaper robusta beans, or a mix. You will get older, staler beans. You will get the poor end of the harvest. However, go above that price and you're needlessly spending extra cash. You're now spending on marketing for the people you're buying it from. You're paying for a fancier bag, better branding etc. This may actually make it taste bette - psychology is a powerful thing, but the beans you're getting won't be significantly different. The problem is, this magic price-point is impossible to find, fluctuates wildly, and it's in the interests of suppliers to obfusticate it as much as possible. My advice would be to try a variety of coffees that you can afford and find one you like. "
Pouring technique for drip/pour over coffee,"From this site: How much: Most pourover drippers work best when they're between one
  half to two-thirds full of coffee grounds. Any less than that, and
  there won't be enough coffee to restrict the flow. Any more, and your
  dripper may overflow. You'll also want to make sure you're dripping
  into a large enough vessel. If you're the more precise-measurement
  type, a good coffee-to-water ratio is between 60-70 grams of coffee
  per liter of water (a mass ratio between 1:16 and 1:14.) Get your clean (filtered if you need it) brew water ready. You'll be using water that's about 30 seconds off boil if you're pouring
  straight out of your boiling kettle, or immediately off boil if you're
  pouring into a second pouring kettle. I like about 207Â°F for medium to
  light roasts, and about 10Â° lower for dark roasts. Start your clock and add enough water to soak all of the coffee (a little premature dripping is okay). Wait for the coffee bed to stop
  the initial swelling (about 30 seconds) before adding more water. Continue your brew. Try to pour quickly, gently, and evenly across the surface of the coffee, pausing between pours to pace your brew to
  your target brew time (see below). The distance that your brew water
  drops can affect brew temperatures, as well as increase or decrease
  the amount of agitation that the falling water creates wherever it
  falls in the coffee bed. In general, the lower you pour from, the
  better, if for no other reason than it's the easiest to create and
  maintain consistency. When you stop adding water, your dripper will continue to drip for
  between 20 and 60 seconds. Your target total brew time is about 2.5 to 3 minutes for dark roasted
  coffee, and 3 to 4 minutes for medium to light roasted coffees. This
  includes the dripping time after you stop adding water."
Is there a way to distinguish decaf from normal coffee?,"Only ""Brew a pot and see if it wakes you up in the morning, or not."" I can't think of any other test that is practical at home. Other practical solutions - Mix them and have half-caf until you buy new coffee. Just buy new coffee, as if it was forgotten in the move. And perhaps mark the containers in some way. In the overall cost of moving, it's a small expense."
How should I clean my burr grinder?,"There are two options. Get yourself some grinder cleaner (Grindz, Urnex and probably other brands), that you just grind through. You can buy it online. It cleans the burrs, removes oils and other residues. Afterwards you need to grind some beans so that you don't have the cleaner in your cup of joe. This is a rather convenient way to clean your grinder, however definitely more costly and wasteful than the second option. Disassemble your grinder according to the instructions provided by Hario and use any kind of brush (toothbrush, pipe cleaner, as long as the bristles are reasonably rigid anything works) to clean the burrs. All the other parts you could also wash with a mild detergent. That's it, it's easy and should be done once every other month in my opinion. I suggest brushing the burrs and rinsing the rest. It's easy, quick and clean enough."
"Why do I feel lousy, low, out of energy after the high coffee gives?","Because coffee and other stimulants do not supply ""energy"" - they cause your body to use its energy reserves a greater or prolonged rate than it normally would. Your body does not burn/feed off the caffeine, the caffeine causes your body to burn glycogen/glucose and fat. So, naturally, once their effects wear off, and your body returns to it's normal state, the energy stores are going to be more depleted than they usually are, and your body will recognize that as feeling run-down afterwards. That's to be expected.  If you use more energy and engage in more activity, one should feel more tired afterwards."
Does the flavour of coffee beans improve after opening the bag?,"That is almost the opposite of my experience, after opening a bag of beans, they have noticeable less flavour after a couple of days. Coffee beans are more resistant than ground coffee though, as that decays in a couple of hours. Obviously, if beans are exposed to air for long enough, their quality is decreasing. However there is an effect that improve them at first, simply because some of the processes from the roasting takes time to finish, and may require several days in order to do so. They may even require exposure to air (oxygen) in order to oxidise some of the compounds causing the flavour. Keep in mind that even though some of the compounds improve, other does not. The most notable degradation in the first days is caused by the most volatile aroma compounds evaporating. This graph shows the stalling of coffee as a function of time. Note that this is just a visualisation of the aroma compounds evaporating, not necessary a measure of quality. The remaining compounds are also changing, and some of them improves over time. "
How to get rid of coffee addiction?,"First, the effects you observe are known as caffeine withdrawal and discussed here. Coffee addiction is previously discussed here. However, it is not discussed how to get rid of a coffee addiction. First, you should understand if overcoming this addiction is necessary. I assume, most people who are members of Coffee SE are not likely to think that. Here is a general link that explains how to get rid of any addiction in three steps:"
Will the quality of the coffee change if I store it in a plastic bottle?,"A short answer is ""not significantly"", assuming you just store your drink for the day, and there is no sharp changes in storage conditions (strong heat, freeze, etc.)---except warming up the amount you want to drink. Coffee drinks are unstable, though, and a simple, freshly passed drip coffee tastes different (quality changes) with time. So quality will actually change over a day, although the difference is hard to notice (except people with very acute taste sense). You are also adding milk, which softens the overall taste, so I think noticing changes in the coffee flavour is even harder. Every vending machine around me (every 100m or so) sells coffee drinks in PET bottles. These bottles are stored for several weeks, and they sell pretty well. They taste fine for that price point and quality, and they are very stable. Of course, they do not include only coffee. They include milk, sugar, and hard-to-spell things. The last category does contain taste stabilizer, etc., so that is unfair comparison. I am just thinking it is interesting to see that coffee in plastic bottles in actually pretty common, especially for relatively short times."
Easiest way to brew an espresso in the office?,"Probably closest to an espresso is an AeroPress, which is similar to a French press, but uses manual pressure to extract more aromatic componds while being lower on bitter and sour notes than most other methods.  And of course all the ""hand filter"" varieties of the drip-family can be an option, if it's simply coffee, not exactly espresso you are after.  In any case you'll need a source of freshly boiled water, e.g. an electric kettle and - important for some offices - the permit to use it.  Of course a good cleaning of the office machine, adjusting it properly and filling it with good beans might be also a step in the right direction... (And have you checked - many machines do have a little hidden ""door"" or similar where you can use your own (ground) coffee.)"
How fine should I grind coffee for drip/pour over coffee,"In general consistency is more important than a specific setting. The key is that you can actually control both the size of the grind and actually achieve a homogenous grind allowing you to increase the consistency in the coffee when you brew it as you can assertively control the service area being exposed during the brewing process. Since you stated that you have a burr grinder you are off to a great start. There is no defined, agreed upon coarseness of grind for pour over coffee, but I would definitely say that you would want a courser grind than you would for espresso. Experiment to find the sweet spot by making sure you use exactly the same water, coffee bean roast, and number of beans (and thus volume) between different grind settings to find what meets your flavor best.  If you are particularly worried about ""getting it right"" or do not want to do a ton of experimentation an easy and quick way to jump to a grid would simply to go to a coffee shop, buy a bag of whole beans, ask them to grind it and query them for how coarse of a grind is. "
Can caffeine be extracted by the body when digesting coffee grounds?,"Yes. Coffee grounds are simply the ground up seeds found inside the berry of the coffea plant, so eat up! Even after the beans have been ground and extracted into your favorite coffee beverage, they still contain plenty of caffeine and are perfectly digestible.  Before people learned to brew coffee, folks were eating the beans to get that coffee boost. Today we eat straight coffee beans through all sorts of preparations. Chocolate covered espresso beans are quite popular and pack quite the kick. Eating coffee beans has even more effect than drinking coffee because not all of the caffeine is extracted through your brewing process. According to the Journal of Agriculture and Food Chemistry, leftover coffee grounds from filter and espresso-type coffeemakers are especially abundant in antioxidants. Plus, you'll get all the benefit of the dietary fiber that's not present in your morning brew.  Enjoy!"
How much does caffeine concentration in a cup of coffee decrease as a function of time (roughly)?,"Caffeine is quite stable, it doesnât evaporate or break down at room temperature (or coffee temperature), apart from dissolving in the water used to brew your coffee. So after an hour or two, the caffeine content is the same1 as right after brewing.  Unfortunately, the same is not true for some of the other substances that have us appreciate coffee, so you may expect the flavor to deteriorate a bit (or a lot, depending on whether you started with a handful of freshly ground slow-roasted beans or a few spoonfuls of Folgerâs coffee-flavored sawdust). But thatâs not what you were asking about. âââ- 1 If we were really nitpicking, we could even say that the caffeine ratio (not content) increases due to a minute bit of water evaporating during the given time frame. But for the average household precision, âstays the sameâ is sufficient."
What is coffee silver skin?,"Silver skin is the name generally used when it is still on the green beans.  This thin but tough layer is lightly colored (sometimes similarly to the paper product in your question) and mostly translucent.  It allows the green color of the bean underneath to be seen.  After roasting (when it begins to loosen and fall off) it is more properly called chaff. Since the paper is likely made of chaff collected from the roasting process (easy to collect since nearly all roasters have a mechanism for separation) is actually an excellent reuse of chaff.  ""Chaff paper"" just doesn't have the same ring since generally chaff is thought to be a byproduct to be discarded.   The silver skin is the innermost layer of the coffee cherry surrounding the pit/seed (green coffee bean).  It is a tough substance to remove and different processing techniques remove varying amounts (dry process coffee removes the least and dry process coffee produces the most chaff when roasting).  Roasting the coffee both dries the silver skin and causes it to split as the coffee bean expands, so it comes off fairly easily during the roasting process given some agitation.  "
What are the cheapest options for making good quality espresso at home?,"It is slightly dependent on your personal definition of espresso. Also the choice depends on how easy you want its operation to be. The moka pot is certainly the cheapest espresso-type device. However, it doesn't fall within the standards of a true Italian espresso, as pointed out in this answer. In particular, you won't have any crema. Hand pumps are inexpensive, compact and light, and have the decent pressure of 8 bars. Although they are marketed as an espresso device for camping, they can be use wherever you have hot water. A step up for home is an aeropress. The way it operates is steep + push-filter (as in a French press), and the result ranges from filter-brew-like to espresso-like. Next in price are probably the capsule espresso machines (such as Nespresso and its clones), which many supermarket chains have cheap versions of. Very easy to use, but unsustainable (see here and in the end of here), and coffee enthusiasts won't consider them an option because of the taste (see the previous link). For related concerns, see the (excellent) answer to this question. And then come two best types: bean-to-cup and traditional espresso machines with a manually operated portafilter. They both are discussed in this answer. Both vary in price and quality significantly; probably a decent traditional machine may have a lower starting price than bean-to-cup machine. You may even find one not much more expensive than a capsule machine. As far as easiness is concerned, capsule and bean-to-cup are obviously easier than moka pots or espresso machines."
How do I heat this very old vacuum pot?,"Great find! How fun. You do indeed have a vacuum coffee maker -- a.k.a. vac-pot, syphon, or siphon. This style of vac-pot is intended to be used on a stove-top (specifically: having a flat bottom, and with a handle on the neck of the bottom part -- the ""bulb"") -- looks a lot like this current model from Bodum - c/o Amazon. There's a good primer on the history and types of vac-pot at WeCraveCoffee with some good pictures. However, in general, glass pots are generally not recommended on flat glass-ceramic cooktops for a couple of reasons: they can scratch or otherwise damage each other, and the poor conductivity of glass makes glass-on-glass heating less efficient. More info on this from a question on Seasoned Advice, and recommendations from GE Appliances for their own stovetops. I did see some products such as this one that depicted glass vac-pots on glass-ceramic cooktops. If all of the glass is high quality, as should be expected for cookware intended to be used on a stove, it should be able to withstand the temperature changes induced by a cooktop. I (personally) would be comfortable using this vac-pot on a gas flame, but cautious/wary of using it on glass-ceramic cooktop. Glass cookware works well over gas flame, but I have less experience with glass cooktops... your ""mileage"" may vary. For a more ""DIY"" adventure as you suggest, consider a mechanism to suspend the vac-pot over a flame heat source. Other styles of vac-pot (such as this Hario model - c/o Amazon) have a scaffolding that holds the bulb (bottom) and the hopper (top) so the whole apparatus can be suspended over a separate heat source, like an alcohol or butane stove. Check some vac-pot brewing guides that show this type of integrated round-bottom bulb and holder (e.g., from Blue Bottle, Stumptown, CoffeeGeek, and many others). Warning: this may remind you of Chemistry lab from School. ;-) And of course be careful with fire. Separately, just for completeness... It also looks like you're missing the filter piece. These are inexpensive (relative to the whole apparatus) and you'll want to purchase a new, compatible one anyway (see also another question on siphon filter replacement).  Another thing you'll want to check is that the rubber seal between the bottom and top parts is still in good shape, especially if this pot hasn't been used in a few decades. This is for reasons both practical (you need a tight seal for the vacuum to work well) and safety (you don't want the seal to come lose and spray boiling-hot water everywhere)!"
Instant coffee has less caffeine than percolated and filter drip?,"With instant coffee, you are not ""practically eating the beans;"" you are drinking reconstituted dried coffee. To create instant coffee granules, the manufacturer first brews the coffee using conventional methods and then either freeze-dries or spray-dries the coffee to create a soluble powder form. Dried coffee. The amount of caffeine in the instant coffee will depend largely the original brewing process. Since commercial instant coffee is created in very large volumes, they are likely extracting coffee faster than our meticulous home-brewed methods. So while caffeine is water soluble, it takes more time for the caffeine to be extracted and absorbed in the water than other compounds. And ""more time"" is not something that the mass-produced instant process allows. Less extraction time = less caffeine."
What is Navy coffee?,"What is Navy coffee? No one really knows for sure. Some naval vessels used to put salt in the coffee either to kill the bitterness (or to help stay hydrated), but it was neither a universal or permanent practice. William Ewing, QM1(SW) USN (ret), Quartermaster E-6 has this to about the subject: When navy coffee was 50% chicory, 50% cheap coffee (most of my career), it was a dying practice, based on previous coffee that was very bitter. Nowadays, the 50% chicory formula is not bitter enough to require that, and many ships get Starbucks, which they then mix with the chicory coffee to smooth the taste even more. Now, for a while, Denny's had some bad coffee, and for over a year, my friends and I added salt to kill the bitterness and extra sugar to overpower the salt. Then Denny's switched blends to one not as awful, so we could drink it without salt. - Do Navy people put salt into their coffee? Other sources say the complete opposite: I had to make many, many pots of coffee as a mess crank (one who spends their first 90 days or so working on the mess decks. Think of it as KP for 90 days straight). We used a large commercial drip coffeepot and coffee, period. No salt was added, at least I never added any. That it is strong comes from the fact that the Navy has no contracts with suppliers that have decent coffee. It is possible that the salty taste does come from the fact that shipboard water is naturally salty. When a ship is in port, she's hooked up to local water. IIRC, ships at sea have a special desalinization process that isn't perfect, but it comes fairly close. - How the Real Men in the Navy Make Their Coffee For a number of years, I used to put salt in the grounds to help remove the bitterness of the coffee. Please not that this was not navy coffee and I was making a 100 cups at a time. No one ever complained, but that might have been to sure dumb luck too. The Urban Possum has this to say about Navy Coffee: Use an economy-brand coffee. Mother Parker's, for example, or Chase & Sanborn. If you have to talk in terms of roasts, these brands are a light to medium--perfectly acceptable to a majority of people. Their virtue is that they're cheap--hey, it's Navy coffee. We're talking government suppliers here.   Use 2 level tablespoons for each 8-ounce cup. The standard measure for coffee is 1 level tablespoon for a 6-ounce cup. The power of Navy Coffee does not derive from the strength of the roast, but from the amount of coffee used, so as you can see, this one is stronger than most. Some old chiefs like the coffee so strong that it actually seems chewy (that comes from the tannins in the coffee and their effects on the tooth surface), but we don't need to go quite that far.  Salt the grounds before you begin brewing. Salt, as in ordinary table salt. The measurement is a pinch, which is about 1/8th to a maximum of 1/4 teaspoon per 5 cups brewed. This is the secret to True Navy coffee: the salt will cut the initial bitterness of the coffee, but takes nothing away from the aroma. Don't worry too much about the taste, Navy coffee won't taste salty unless you use too much of it.  As a side note, the navy often employs the term a Cup of Joe to their Navy Coffee. Where this tradition first came into use is unknown but some believe it was due to the Secretary of the US Navy, Admiral Josephus âJoeâ Daniels who abolished wine (or alcohol) on Navy ships in 1914.  Thus, coffee (the next best thing) was the beverage of choice for the sailors."
What are the effects of caffein olfaction?,"From Time Magazine's You Can Now Inhale Caffeine Instead of Drinking It article:  Forget coffee and energy drinksânow you can inhale your caffeine. ...
     Each inhaler boasts a pretty small amount of caffeine, which the
     company says comes from natural sources like guarana, taurine, and
     ginseng (stimulants that are also common among energy drinks). Since it can be absorbed into your body (nasal, oral mucosa and lungs), there would be a neurological response, hopefully positive."
Non-plastic version of an AeroPress?,"This may be off topic because it is opinion-based and hypothetical in nature. There may be some merit however because it is presented with a ""fair and impartial tone"" and invites experiences over opinions that may be backed up with references. Especially in the world of coffee, where brewing methods are identified by brands, it is hard to not talk about specific products. Therefore, I'll try to answer as best I can. First, let's talk about some of your suggestions: Ideally, double-walled tempered glass housing Part of the appeal of an Aeropress is that is durable, fool-proof, and easily brought on camping trips or stored in drawers and backpacks. Along with being bulky, doubled-walled glass or stainless steel would add weight and fragility. fine stainless steel filter This is definitely an option, and you can buy metal filters for a few popular brew methods including Chemex and Aeropress, and off course, french press is typically a metal mesh filter. The thing about metal filters compared to cloth or paper is that even the finest ones cannot filter at the same level. Metal filters will always let in more oils and fines compared to paper, and this is why the might not be desirable for an Aeropress, where clean, bright coffee is expected. Is there any reason why cork wouldn't work for this? Cork does seal well under the right conditions. But that's the key: right conditions. In a wine bottle, there is 1/2 and inch to 3/4 of an inch in diameter, and the cork is typically more than an inch long. It has also been created, molded, and formulated specifically for that task. A cork plunger would need to be thicker and be made specifically for that application to work, because you would't want it to flex and break the seal.  Also, cork is terrible at remaining taste-neutral. Every cup of coffee you brewed would impart taste into the cork and negatively effect every other cup. You could prevent this by putting a layer of something on the bottom if the cork, but then you start looking at using plastics. If you're looking for brewing methods similar to the Aeropress, I might suggest something like the ROK. It uses hand pressure to extract espresso. No, i is not as easily carried around like an Aeropress but has a similar function. If you're looking for brewers that have no plastic, well, there are many options in that field too such as french press, Chemex, mocha pot, espresso machine etc. Beyond that, you could try modifying a glass french press with some sort of cloth filter to create a sort of reverse Aeropress. You can try looking around other options online too. Hope this helps to answer your question!"
Is there a difference in quality of using a plastic/wood/metal stirrer?,"I'm just reasoning... Polished gold or porcelain must be the ideal stirrers as they won't chemically react. I opt for porcelain as it may also help keeping the coffee warm as its thermal conductivity is less than gold. Comparing the three you mentioned: Wooden: Sometimes I taste it. So, I don't prefer it that much. Plastic: There are many polymers we call plastic in our daily life. Some of these things are really of bad quality and I am suspicious if their thermal resistance is adequate for coffee. I wouldn't prefer them, too. Metal: Especially, if you mention polished 18/10 stainless steel cutlery, they probably resist the heat and won't react with anything. So, the only bad thing about them is, they may make your cup colder a bit quicker than usual. Just take the spoon off right after use. This would be my preference."
"Espresso, pour starts dripping halfway?","It's the pre-infusion feature of your machine in conjunction with the grind you were using. From their site: Pre-Infusion: To extract the full flavor and aroma when you brew your espresso, the R58 has a dual pre-infusion system encompassing a working piston and static pre-infusion chamber. Most machines that have this feature understand that the pre-infusion is done based on the amount of water that has flowed, not how much time has passed (which is a good thing). So, if the puck is too dense, it can take quite a bit of time. Adjusting grind a bit should fix it."
Which books do you recommend to read for people who are interested in coffee?,"I also agree that ""The World Atlas of Coffee"" by James Hoffman is a good book.
It covers a lot of things including the history of coffee, growing and production as well as roasting and brewing. A big section of the book is indeed an atlas, showing various countries and where the coffees are grown. Nice maps and plenty of good photo's too. If you are already very knowledgeable about coffee and have read many other books on the subject , you probably won't get too much extra out of this but it's certainly more than a quick introduction. I think it would be of great interest for somebody who has become interested in coffee and wants to find out more about the whole process from shrub to cup.  Added another one:
""Coffee - A Celebration of Diversity"" by Fulvio Eccardi and Vincenzo Sandali. This was originally published in Italian in 2000 and the English translation became available in 2002, so it's not the most up to date book and I'm not sure whether it's still available but  it is definitely worth grabbing if you can get hold of it. It has beautiful photographs (including some lovely satellite views of coffee growing areas) but is also rich in information. In many ways it overlaps with The World Atlas of Coffee above although it focuses more on the cultivation and production and doesn't have as much on the roasting and brewing. But it's worth getting for the pictures alone."
Can drinking coffee at least once a day increase anxiety?,"There's a lot of studies/articles, but when it comes down to it it's just like any other ""drug"": it affects each person differently. I drink almost a pot a day, and have since I was around 17/18, and have no worsened conditions if I don't consume coffee. Some months I go with only a cup a day, and others its ~3-4 cups - and nothing changes drastically. As with anything else, especially ""drugs"", moderation is key.  This is, of course, anecdotal, so... Brewing Trouble: Coffee-induced anxiety (WebMD)"
What is the standardized naming of this type of coffee?,"The drip-type coffee is available in many countries in Europe. A list of names: Can you see a pattern here: Always a combination of coffee and filter/filtered. The terms are so closely related that if you order ""filtered coffee"" an attentive waiter should be able to help you even if you don't know the precise term at your destination. Note that if you order ""coffee"" without specifying the preparation, you will be served the local ""default"". This will actually be filtered coffee in many countries of Northern and Central Europe, in Italy, as counter-example, you will get what you'd call ""espresso"", likewise in Spain or Portugal: small, strong.  Asking for caffÃ¨ americano will perhaps get you an espresso diluted with hot water in some places in Italy (sources vary whether it's a remenant from WW II or started with international tourism), sometimes caffÃ¨ all'americana (""coffee American-style"") will get you drip coffee. Likewise in touristy areas of Spain, cafÃ© americano might get you a diluted coffee. Further north you won't be understood. They will probably direct you to the nearest Starbucks. Source:

What makes a coffee turn out sour?,When the water has too short of a time to extract the flavor from the bean. Try grinding the beans a bit smaller.
"Should I use the airtight container, or the opaque container?","I value sealed over opaque. Go for the sealed glass. Opaque is not really the goal, but rather in the dark. Keeping the stuff in a dark location, even in a clear container, will be fine. As far as priorities for storage in general, according to the USA National Coffee Association (and others including Blue Bottle and a lengthy missive from The Atlantic), there are four things that are most important for coffee freshness; that is, minimizing exposure to the following: ... in that order, according to NCAUSA (first link above). That is, keep it sealed (minimizing airflow and humidity, most important), cool (but not cold/refrigerated), and in the dark (somewhat less important). The best place to do this is in an airtight container in a dark, cool pantry. If kept in a dark place, you don't even need to make the container opaque. Lastly, the ""light"" factor is the lowest in priority, so ""mostly dark"" is probably good enough. I tend to re-use coffee containers for this purpose (I have a bunch of illy cans such as these that work well, are a good size, and have a one-way valve on the bottom). Once you buy the coffee, the tins are ""free""!"
How long will iced latte keep in the Fridge?,"When I worked in a coffee shop and we prepared a beverage similar to an iced latte, we always mixed the milk in with the chilled espresso. Keep in mind this was a beverage prepared ahead of time and not server to the client right away. We NEVER added dairy to espresso and then chilled it for later.  It has been shown that 1 liter of milk can develop harmful bacteria after being in a room temperature space for as little as half an hour. I would highly recommend that you do not prepare your iced lattes completely with milk and then chill them. I recommend making the espresso, adding whatever sugar or flavor you want while it is still hot, chilling it in the fridge, and then adding milk to the espresso once it has been chilled or when you are looking to drink it. This will keep for a maximum of 48 hours. As with all coffee, the fresher the better, but if you are indeed looking for a quick way to grab an iced latte, I would do so in the manner I described."
What do all the symbols on my coffee lid mean?,"I am pretty sure it says NO TL316 LID.  That's the item/stock number for that particular size lid (based on a Google search, also available in black!). There are basically two sets of initials for the same thing Decaf, (C)ream, (S)ugar, (C-S) Cream and Sugar, and then one set has the B for Black.  Presumably these could be grease penciled or highlighted on a large order. I honestly have no idea on the 19.  It may be some sort of internal tracking mechanism for manufacturing, because other examples from a Google image search have different numbers there."
Re-using spent coffee grounds?,"There are a few elements to this answer, so I'll try to tackle them one by one. is it possible to brew another cup with the used grounds...? Yes. It is physically possible to do this. Just do what you described and voila, more liquid into the next mug. this would be the same as using more water and brewing over a carafe to brew twice as much coffee This is where you are wrong. Brewing coffee is chemistry, whether you are using a Chemex or an espresso machine or a cheap drip machine. Each stage of brewing produces different flavours from the coffee. I can't guarantee this is accurate but here is an example of what I'm talking about. The first part of your pour controls the bitterness of the coffee. The bloom helps to get rid of CO2 and dissolves oils on the beans and in the grounds. It will develop your ""body"". The second part of your pour will determine the sweetness. Some people swear by small pours over a longer period of time, while others prefer the ease of just slowly filling the brewer evenly. Finally, the last half of your pour controls the intensity of your cup. This is where your question comes in. More water in this last section will produce a weaker cup, and less water a stronger one. All of these parts of the pour need to be melded together to create a delicious cup of coffee. Pouring your first cup then re-using the grounds for the second one means the second cup misses out of the main part of the brew. Yes, the liquid will tastes like coffee, but will not have very much caffeine, and will lack the flavours present in a well-brewed cup. You're basically making ultra-weak, bland coffee.  If you want to make more coffee and don't care about the strength, brew a larger batch into one carafe, then swirl and split it between tow cups. You should adjust your grounds-to-water ratio accordingly though. I hope this helps you answer your question!"
Should I press the coffee tight?,"What you're talking about is commonly referred to as ""tamping"". This is generally only used in making espresso, and is not recommended for any other brew method that I know of. You are correct in assuming that the tamping will increase brew times and therefore the coffee will be in contact with the water for longer. This of course produces a stronger coffee. However, this is not the ""correct"" way to increase the strength of coffee. The generally accepted way of doing this is changing the brew ratio. The brew ratio is the ratio of grounds to water, typically denoted in grams. The ratios range greatly depending on type of brewing. Tamping the coffee will also affect the flavour of the coffee, because one part of water will extract from one part of grounds longer, producing an undesirable taste. If you want stronger coffee, simply add more grounds to your filter basket. This way your water is not in contact with the grounds for too long, but rather extracts from more grounds. The flavour will be noticeably better through this method. Hope this helps!"
Why is my drip-coffee machine making watery coffee lately?,"Well this is a strange problem but it seems to have to do with the new grinder you are using or the way you use it since the grind is the only variable that has changed (according to your story). Watery coffee most often means that you don't use enough ground coffee. Try using 6g of coffee per 100ml of water for a medium roast. If the roast is very light you may use a slightly higher coffee to water ratio. If it is not the quantity of coffee it is probably the grinder setting. Try a finer grind, something between table salt and sand (probably just the medium-fine setting on your grinder, however do check with your fingers). The problem may be what was suggested in the comments. If the grind is too coarse, the water is just running through the coffee and doesn't leave the time to spread and steep. This is in line with the hole in the center of the coffee bed you are describing. Maybe try to measure the time the coffee needs to run through and see if it changes if you grind finer. If this doesn't help then I'd suggest you properly clean the spout and make sure the water is dripping out the way it is supposed to. Maybe scale has built up which is channeling the water, forcing it through the spout in a stream that hits the coffee grounds with too much pressure. I suggest you try all of the above which will most likely solve your problem. Additionally however you could cut up some standard paper filters and place them on the ground coffee so that it is completely covered. In theory the water should then distribute much more evenly through the grounds. I'd suggest you do this only after you have solved the general problem as a means to improve the flavor. It'd definitely be a quite ""hacky"" solution and I think first of all your machine should work the way it is supposed to."
Coffee philosophy: Ice then coffee or coffee then ice,"I'll give some background, a hypothesis, and (more important) instructions to find out experimentally. The experiment is easy and fun. I did experiments such as paper vs. bamboo filter, slightly different grind sizes, fresh beans vs. 7-weeks off roast, and different coffee:water ratios within the range of a scoop measurement (i.e. is it important to weigh the coffee?). Background: The Lady tasting tea experiment is at the start of modern statistics and randomized trials. (There's now a book, The Lady Tasting Tea: How Statistics Revolutionized Science in the Twentieth Century.) The question was, âDoes it matter to add tea to milk vs. milk to tea?â It turns out the answer is yes. Speculation and Hypothesis: Adding milk to tea lets significantly more milk get hotter than adding tea to milk does. That could enable more of it to react chemically, e.g. curdling. But that's unlikely with ice, so I'll bet adding ice to hot coffee vs. hot coffee to ice makes no discernable difference in taste. (Let's ignore the fact that dropping ice into hot coffee could splash out more hot coffee than the reverse.) How to Experiment: Do a Triangle Test with 3 or more people. Make the iced coffee both ways, ""A"" and ""B"", keeping all other variables as constant as you can. Each person gets 3 cups, one of which is different than the other two, e.g. a sequence like A-B-A or B-B-A. Give a different random combination to each taster, of course without revealing it. All tasters should start by tasting their 3 cups in order. Then they can go back and forth between cups as much as they like. Their job is to try to discern the difference and say which of the 3 cups tastes the most different. You might also ask them to state their preference. When they all make their choices, then you can reveal the combinations. The Math is Not Hard: If a taster gets it right, we really don't know if they were lucky or good. The default explanation (""null hypothesis"") for the combined test results is that they're within a reasonable range of random results. Dice would randomly get 1/3 of the choices right. If enough people got it right that the odds were small enough of dice getting a result that extreme or better, then we'll conclude the tasters can discern the difference. Different fields of science may use different thresholds. Pick a threshold before doing the experiment. A common standard for ""statistical significance"" is â¤ 5%. With 3 tasters, if they all get it right, that's a 1/(33) = 1/27 = 3.7% chance, which beats the 5% threshold. If K of N tasters get it right, the calculation considers the number of ways to get K of N correct choices and the probability of each random choice being correct (1/3). The Google Sheets formula for Probability{x â¥ K of N correct choices} is: so if that value is â¤ 5%, we'll conclude that people can reliably taste the difference. Tip: To prepare for an experiment, I make paper strips with the different test sequences. Whoever pours for taster n will pick a strip at random, pour those cups while out of view, stash the strip in a pocket, and bring it out after everyone has written down their tasting choices. There needs to be at least enough strips for the number of tasters, and usually a multiple of 6 strips since there are 6 possible sequences. But when there are only 3 tasters, I prune it to 2 sequences that have one A and two B's and 2 sequences that have one B and two A's, so we can't all get the same odd one out. Tip: Each taster gets 3 cups of coffee, a spit cup, water, crackers, and a napkin. I put painter's tape on the coffee cups to mark consistent fill lines and to label them 1, 2, and 3."
Starting a cafe -- simple and gradual ways?,"Ah, I was going to make the same point as Travelling Particle - work in a coffee shop - but then you mention that you are in Japan. First, you will need to find a roaster where you can get fresh roast daily or as needed - hopefully with a business discount. Get a decent grinder and I would go this route for brewing a cup:  It's doesn't get much simpler then this and it looks nice. The Japanese are a people that have a Tea Ceremony and they may appreciate this."
Does this look like a decent coffee grinder?,"It looks like a burr grinder, as opposed to a blade grinder. Burr grinders give a more consistent grind size, which is why they're preferred over blade grinders. My guess is it's made of steel, but it does look tarnished. You might take it apart and polish it to create a smoother grinding surface. The wood on the inside might be difficult to clean of coffee oils and impart an odor to your freshly ground coffee. I can't tell if the mechanism has a means of changing the grind size. If not, it may in fact be an old spice mill. Otherwise, it won't allow you much variety when grinding your coffee. If it's given a little TLC I think it would make a nice vintage manual grinder. Compared to blade grinders, even this older grinder ought to do a better job than they ever could. However, if you can't change the grind size than you'll be limited in the type and quality of the coffee you can brew using it."
What Are The Merits of Different Green Coffee Processing Methods?,"There are many other factors influencing coffee processing that should be kept in mind.  Individual farmers may not have a choice of processing method.  In many places the processing centers for coffee are quite separate from farms and only one processing center may be available.  Local conditions will also largely dictate what methods are appropriate or available.  There are also a myriad of variations on these methods that may produce different results and weather can play a factor as well (think about an area hit by a monsoon while large batches are trying to dry).  At some level, all farmers are trying to get paid for what they produce.  That being the case, most will prefer some combination of whatever local processing method is available and/or cheapest and produces the highest pricing for their product.  "
How can I calibrate my Hario grinder?,"Short answer: Slowly. Binary search. But for espresso, Turkish, moka, or AeroPress: I adjust mine to nearly the tightest (smallest) setting possible that still allows me to turn the crank without difficulty. Method: This is how I adjust mine. My experience: I have a similar Hario model (this one), which sounds marginally more difficult to adjust than the one you're talking about. I use mine for almost all of my daily coffee grinding. I set it very infrequently: I go through phases between pour-over and moka, and I try not to go through these phases more than once per month to avoid adjusting this thing. To adjust my model: I mark the ""set-screw"" nut with a marker to remember where I've tried. I try to avoid going more than one revolution either way; on mine, two revolutions goes from moka-fine powder to French-press coarseness. When you've figured it out... I have put scratch ""marks"" on the screw for I (moka: fine), II (drip: medium), III (French press: coarse) so that I don't have to guess quite as much. Highly recommend indelible marks on your grinder once you find the setting you like. To change from one setting to the other, adjust to the middle: then go tighter to the ""fine"" setting, and looser to the ""coarse"" setting (otherwise, it can be ambiguous). Other than changing the settings, I like the thing. There was even a Kickstarter that funded a stabilizing mechanism for the bottom to ensure a more-even grind: it launched as EvenGrind (I have no affiliation with it)."
Capresso Static Effects on Grounds,Try putting a couple of drops of water in your coffee beans before putting them in the grinder's hopper. Known as the Ross Droplet Technique.
Homemade Highlander Grogg,"For certain high-intensity flavours, often people use extracts (think stuff like ""vanilla extract"") or essential oils (i.e., oils that are the ""essence"" (or are infused with same) of a given plant or something). This allows you to use a very small amount of the flavouring substance in something like coffee or confectionery or so. However, certain extracts or might just be artificial themselves, and give you that same ""off"" after-taste. This might be what's in your bag of beans/grounds and why you're in this predicament in the first place. The ingredient label might have some hints but is probably not helpful (""natural and/or artificial flavourings"" perhaps). Here's one (judgemental) example of how the ubiquitous hazlenut flavoured coffee (from Serious Eats) could be made. For butterscotch that you cite, for example, you could use something like butterscotch extract (example from Amazon). You could also use some other caramel or butterscotch syrup, or even make your own. For particular flavours, after you've identified them, you might ask over at Seasoned Advice. But I'm glad you asked here first :) Happy hacking!"
Can flavoured coffees alter the shelf life of the coffee?,"You are quite right - the flavouring does indeed change the shelf life in a certain way. It is necessary to look at this from two perspectives. The flavouring compounds used to flavour coffees last longer without degrading. This means that they ARE NOT the limiting factor when it comes to the shelf life of a coffee. Therefore, shelf life is not changed by flavouring the coffee as these compounds degrade (or go bad) after the coffee itself. Because the coffee has been treated with flavouring compounds, it will hide certain aspects of degradation of the coffee due to aging, decaffeination, and oxidation.  In addition, these flavors help extend the shelf life of coffee by
  disguising changes in flavor due to decaffeination, oxidation, or
  aging processes. Source: How Products are Made Therefore, shelf life by taste is changed, as the flavouring compounds mask the degradation and therefore the bad tastes of the aging coffee."
Does caffeinating my hair follicles help prevent hair loss? [closed],"I'm aware of one in vitro study (though there might be others) of that demonstrate that caffeine is effective at certain types of hair loss -- in a ""test tube"", anyway. That is, this study from 2007 (another link from publisher, a colloquial summary of the study) took biopsy samples of follicles from men with AGA (""male pattern baldness"") and treated them caffeine (and hormones), finding that caffeine was ""a promising candidate for hair growth stimulation"" and ""may have important clinical impact"". Another note is that this is ex vivo -- which I take to mean topical in this sense -- drinking a bunch of coffee is unlikely to help (the summary article suggests that the dose necessary of orally-consumed coffee to get the same effect is ~6 grams -- many dozens of cups of coffee, and perhaps fatal dose). If you don't happen to subscribe to the International Journal of Dermatology you can obtain the PDF of this article for perhaps a small fee. I don't know if this has been demonstrated in any clinical trials. I can't find any longitudinal studies of longer-term effectiveness, nor can I find any evidence of actual clinical trials. There are a few more links in the caffeine-related clauses at the management of hair loss Wikipedia article. Also, as an aside, you might get a little ""caffeine buzz"" from it! There are some bar soaps, like this one, that make the (largely unverified) claim that some of the caffeine is absorbed through your skin. Win-win? ""To keep this on-topic..."" As for using instant coffee or some other source of caffeine (e.g., pills) to be applied topically to your scalp, I can't find anything about that either. Concentrations cited in the study are ""0.001% and 0.005%."" Coffee beans themselves have about 1-4% caffeine before roasting, so it's reasonable to expect that you could get to the concentration used in the study with a paste of instant coffee, but I don't know about the ""bioavailability"" of caffeine from topical application of instant coffee. Robusta beans are generally on the higher end of caffeine content and might be cheaper. Also, green beans will have a higher caffeine content than roasted, but I might be taking this a bit too far... Standard disclaimer -- this isn't medical advice, I'm not a doctor, seek actual legitimate advice if you have health concerns."
Do the size and shape of a cezve matter?,"In short: Using a cezve of the correct size works better. The situation is similar to using appropriate equipment size in other coffee preparation methods (other examples at the bottom).  That said, you can probably brew a passable cup of Turkish (or other names) coffee when your cezve isn't full to the neck (or, using a cezve that's ""too large"").  However, there are reasons for the shape and size of a cezve (as you suggest in your question), and it really does help in practice: There are a bunch of brewing guides that suggest reasons; this one  suggests stirring down several times, and says the size is due to ""physics"" without explanation; here's another. This one from CoffeeGeek suggests that the shape (narrowing toward the top) helps to prevent the foam from burning to the side of the pot (becoming bitter); this makes sense especially when using a small pot on a gas stove, when the heat will try to hug the sides of the pot. And this one doesn't say to stir. All of them suggest, but none that I could find explicitly state the reason why the foam forms better.  In a pinch, I have tried to make Turkish coffee in a regular handled pan; it simply doesn't work as well. Something magical happens in the neck of a cezve to help that delicious foam to form; the best I can figure is that it's fragile, and the narrower neck somehow helps concentrate the bubbles, helps keep the foam together, and keeps it from collapsing.  Other examples of equipment size mattering when you're making coffee with other methods:"
Does caffeine raise cholesterol (good or bad)?,"Coffee beans contain a chemical called cafestol, which tends to increase blood cholesterol levels, especially LDL (""bad"") cholesterol. Brewing with a paper filter seems to reduce the levels of these cholesterol-raising chemicals in brewed coffee by filtering out these chemicals (e.g., cafestol, kahweol). Levels of cafestol in coffee are higher in non-paper-filtered brewing methods, such as French press and others. Here's one article that discusses this, and another pointed out by @apaul34208 in comments. EDIT: Links to actual studies. Here are two studies that discuss this further: one from van Dusseldorp, et al., 1991 that talks about ""a factor"" (i.e., an as-yet-unidentified compound) that has a cholesterol-raising impact. A later paper (Urgent, Katan 1997) identifies these factors as ""diterpene lipids cafestol and kahweol"". Specifically, the abstract from the latter article states that ""[paper] filtered coffee does not affect cholesterol."""
Do I need to boil the water before using my moka?,It is true.  Preboiling the water will make the coffee tastes a lot better. It will reduce the bitterness and give space for a lot of other notes. Heating up the Mokka too much releases also metallic taste from the machine itself and you boil the coffee.
Does longer brewing time with hot water negatively effect flavor?,"As discussed further in this question about bitterness, degree of extraction is one significant factor in bitterness in your cup. There are a couple of other links to coffee bitterness in that question also. Keeping other major factors constant (e.g., same temperature of water, same beans), time and grind level are the easiest to modify to reduce bitterness. That is: shorter time and coarser grind will (generally) result in less bitter coffee. While you certainly can't expect to get a reasonable brew from barely chopped beans in 15 seconds, small changes in time and grind level can have a noticeable impact on outcomes, especially for immersion-style brewing methods like French press, Aeropress, pour-over, and to a lesser extent stovetop methods like percolator or moka. Specifics vary by brewing method. For instance, some bitter-tasting compounds are filtered out by paper filters, so paper-filter pour-over will generally be less bitter than French press, for example. Also, your average paper filter will allow brewed coffee to filter more quickly with a coarser grind (finer grinds will more quickly clog the filter) so you might have to vary your pouring method to keep the total brewing time constant. You might enjoy trying to vary one parameter at a time: trying coarser- or finer-grind coffee, then with a shorter or longer period of time, in both cases trying to vary only one parameter at a time."
Are there any natural sweeteners that work well with coffee?,"The best natural options for sweetening are, in my humble opinion, actual sugar or sugar syrups. Options include, in general order from less to more distinct taste... Though I personally prefer my coffee black and unsweetened, I've used all of these in coffee. Any sweetener will change the taste slightly. The problem with stevia, for me anyway, is that the bitter notes of stevia are overpowering; I can't consume the stuff. If you're looking for a non-nutritive or lower-calorie alternative, you can look at various sugar alcohols, which are (or at least can be) naturally-produced, lower-calorie variants of sugars. They are produced by various methods, including fermentation. A good possibility is xylitol, which is somewhat lower in effective calories and nearly as sweet as table sugar with less off-tastes than other sugar alternatives. Another option is erythritol, but may be less-commonly available. World-wide, other options including mannitol, sorbitol, maltitol, and isomalt may be more common. Note well: different sugar alcohols may have effects on your digestive system, including bloating and loose stool, especially when consumed in large quantities. Start slowly :)"
Bulletproof Coffee - Is There A Good Replacement For Grass-Fed Butter?,"I have seen folks use coconut oil as a substitute for grass fed butter (or organic butter, or Irish butter or many other variations I have heard).  Almost all of the substitutes I have heard are fat sources designed to get fat based calories into the coffee.  The vanilla bean powder you have heard about adds almost no calories, but will certainly add flavor.  It accomplishes a very different goal than what the Bulletproof folks are espousing. Keep in mind there are any number of things you can add to coffee to make the caffeine more palatable.  There is an entire industry surrounding this.  What you really need to ask is what you are trying to accomplish by adding something and find the best ingredient for your needs.  Low or no calories flavoring agents maybe suited if you are just not into the taste of coffee.  If you are looking for a fat calorie source, experimenting with different oils until you find one that fits your needs and has a flavor you can deal with may be the way to go.   Personally I look for more protein and not as much fat in my diet.  I like the taste of coffee.  A plain cup of cone coffee and a serving of organic Greek yogurt accomplishes what I am trying to do just fine and doesn't require breaking out or cleaning a blender.  "
How Much Should I Spend When Investing In An At-Home Espresso Machine?,"It's important to note that you should be thinking of your entire espresso budget (i.e. Machine, Grinder, and Accessories) when trying to find the ""right"" price. If you were to buy a $1000 machine, you'd want to spend minimally $300 on an espresso grinder. If you're looking at spending a $1000 total and go with something that requires a little more technique, maybe the popular Rancilio Silvia / Rocky combination is right for you. Also, some say that the grinder is actually the most important component to consider when trying to make amazing coffee on a budget. It might be worth shorting yourself a bit on the machine to afford yourself a better grinder in the long run. I'd recommend the Baratza Vario as a starting point. It's pricier, but it does a fantastic job for both drip and espresso. Also, Baratza has amazing support/service and a history of quality. That can be worth quite a bit in the long run."
Coffee Grinder vs. Spice Grinder - What's the difference?,"(Note: With a general perspective, you may classify coffee as a spice.) I imagine you mention the hand grinders. In that case, the main difference is the size of the canals of the grinders. E.g. in a black pepper grinder, the average diameter of the canals are a bit wider than the average diameter of black peppers. However, this diameter is far narrower for coffee beans. So, you cannot grind coffee in a pepper grinder effectively as the beans cannot fit in the canals. Summary: proper grinder for proper spice. After Burhan added the image, I think I should make an edition to this answer. This grinders are called blade grinders. The main disadvantage of these is the grounds are not homogenously grinded after the process. As the blades randomly cut the beans, some of them may stay intact on the sides. Burr grinders doesn't have this possibility. All grinded pieces have a maximum volume after the process. Otherwise, I can't think of a difference. However, you shouldn't use the same grinder for both. You don't want the aroma of your coffee to be mixed with spices and herbs. :)"
Is coffee blocking the body from absorbing nutrients?,"In a collaborative study at Creighton University in Nebraska and the University of Miami, Florida, researchers showed that caffeine may interfere with vitamin D absorption. The results, published in the ""Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,"" demonstrated that the higher the level of caffeine, the more it interfered with vitamin D absorption. The study suggested that caffeine did this by reducing the expression of vitamin D receptors on osteoblasts in the body -- the cells responsible for producing bone. http://www.direct-ms.org/pdf/VitDGenScience/Caffeine%20Vit%20D%20receptor%2007.pdf"
Can you make Peanut butter flavoured coffee?,"Inspired by your question I did some experimentation. Peanut butter itself did not work well for me, I could not get it to mix well. I happened to have a powdered penut butter, this worked much better.  I added it like it was powdered cream and sure enough it tasted like peanut butter coffee! The perfect ratio for me seemed to be 2 tbsp per 6 oz cup. It was much better with a little sugar, even though I typically don't add sugar to my coffee. It tasted good, smells great, was more filling then a normal cup of coffee. But the taste was not great, so i won't be drinking it again unless I find a way to improve the taste. The bottom of the cup was very bad because it did not mix fully. So i would recommend blending for anyone who wishes to recreate the coffee treat.  While disapointed with PB coffee. Coffee flavor peanut butter is awesome. Specifically Chocolate Coffee Peanut Butter. As its probable inventor it shall now be called Mocha-PB!  Same ingredients as above except use a chocolate flavored powdered Peanut Butter and change the ratios. Use the instructions on the back of the powdered peanut butter but use hot coffee instead of water. Tastes great on a salty cracker or toast."
Is coffee good to consume before sport?,"There are studies that have shown a marked increase in performance compared to a placebo in athletes who drank coffee before a workout. Both strength and endurance exercises saw improvement. As to the diruretc and constructive effects, it would seem that staying hydrated (which you should do anyway when exercising) is an effective way to combat the nominal downsides.
Below are the studies in question.  al., G.M.S.e., Effect of caffeine on sport-specific endurance performance: A systematic review. .

What makes coffee from a coffee shop/cafe better than the coffee I make at home?,"Three things contribute to a good cup of coffee. The coffee itself. The tools used to prepare the coffee. The skills of the person making the coffee. Unless you're talking about espresso or espresso based drinks (cappuccino) the skill involved is easily developed.  Do you use a burr grinder or a blade to grind your coffee? Or do you use pre-ground coffee? This, believe it or not, makes a huge difference. Coffee shops use a burr grinder to get a consistent grind. Without knowing the coffee shops you're referring to (as well as your own brewing habits) it's hard to give a reasoned answer. It may simply be the coffee used and the amount of coffee used."
What grind to use for a Phin (Vietnamese Coffee Maker)?,"For a phin, most websites recommend using a grind that you would use for a standard drip machine or a grind that is slightly coarser. Because every phin is different, it is necessary to experiment with the grind and find the result that fits your tastes best. For someone who cannot drink strong coffee, it is best to err on the side of caution and make their grind slightly coarser and adjust to a finer grind slowly. The best taste profile will be found this way. Useful resources:"
Can a cup of coffee explode if heated in microwave? [closed],"As others have stated, superheating can happen in a microwave, especially when using a smooth vessel, e.g. a new, unscratched cup. It is more likely in pure water, but not unheard of from other liquids. But you need a hack:
The key to prevent superheating and a subsequent flash of steam when the cup is moved or so is to supply nucleation sites, or, simply put, some rough surfaces or gas bubbles where the water can turn to vapour."
Paper Filters for Basket,"There are ""basket-shaped"" filters, which I think is what you're looking for. In my area, they're just as common as ""Melitta-style"" cone-shaped filters; you should be able to find them at most markets / grocery-stores. They come in various sizes; you're probably looking for one of the smaller (""junior size"") variety.  From this previous answer, here's a picture of what you're looking for, I think: a basket-style filter:  You can also find them online -- one example of the ""junior size"" basket filter, which is what I think you want based on what you said about the size of the machine/filters. There are 3 main sizes (and probably more): ""junior size"" (for ~2-6 cup machines -- as linked above), the most common normal/medium size (for 8-12 cup machines), and the large/extra-large size (for large/commercial 20+ cup machines). They tend to be inexpensive and come in large packs... I hope you drink a lot of coffee ;-)"
Triple venti meaning at Starbucks,"Refers to those shots of espresso. You have 2 in there by default. (The iced Venti drinks typically get 3, because the cup is a little larger (24 oz.))"
Is it possible to make latte-art with a coffee machine that has a cappucinatore?,"Latte art typically requires you to pour one thing into the other (the frothed milk into the espresso). You could of course try to move the cup with the milk already in it while brewing the espresso in such a way that the coffee leaves a pattern in the milk. But that will be very difficult and will also look very different from normal latte art. So no, that will not really be possible. You should steam your milk in a pitcher and pour it from there into the cup with the espresso."
Reusable Nespresso pixie capsules,"I used empty capsules to fill my own coffee and brew it using a Nespresso machine. I would say the result largely depends on the coffee you use, but not the capsules itself. It takes several tries until you get the right amount of coffee into one capsule (I had to stuff one brand of coffee quite tight to get a crema at all), and the amount differs very much from coffee to coffee. Of course, the grind matters a lot, but you can compensate with the amount of coffee. The only problem I had with the capsules is that sometimes they got stuck when discharging, but you can usually fiddle them out using a fork or so."
How can I identify which Keurig machines have Keurig 2.0 DRM?,"It appears specific models are under the Keurig 2.0 label.  The K250, K350, K450, K550 will be clearly marked Keurig 2.0, which use the label DRM."
Roast vs Body vs Acidity,"I'm not really an expert, but in basic terms: Roast darkness:  Body: Acidity: Now as mentioned in the comments these terms are really painfully relative, and somewhat rendered meaningless by an onslaught of advertisers claiming that their coffee is ""smooth dark and full-bodied"" regardless of the real characteristics. "
Troubleshooting Moka coffee grind size vs sediments,"A Moka grind is a tad coarser than espresso grind and ideally finer than standard pour over. If itâs too fine, youâll see the excessive sediments or - worst case - even clogging up. The size of the largest particles in your first picture are French press or even cold-brew worthy: I can see the curved, smooth outside of the beans. If you also get sediments, it means you have a very inhomogeneous grind, I would suspect a blade grinder instead of a burr grinder was used.
See that section of your first photo, with the extremes circled:  Considering the difference in particle size, you will always get over extracted and under extracted coffee j the same cup, independent of brewing method. Your last picture shows a rather watery, thin coffee over the sediments, I would expect coffee from a Moka to be more opaque and possibly darker. As a fix, you could try sifting the coffee to separate the various sizes a bit, but frankly, I never was particularly successful with that. Apart from that, Iâd first try the batch in a pour-over setup and if that doesnât work (e.g. clogging up the filter), move up to French press."
When to add alcohol for Irish coffee,"An Irish coffee is traditionally a strong sweetened (with muscovada or demerara sugar or syrup) coffee with a doubleshot of Whisky (I guess around 40-50ml for a glass of coffee of 150ml) and a layer of aerated cream on top of it. I don't know what was used traditionally, I assume some kind of turkish coffee (or ""Cowboy coffee""), where the grounds steep in water just of the boil for a few minutes or percolater coffee. Today I would probably use french press coffee or AeroPress with a metal disk instead of paper filter. You should keep in mind, that the coffee-sugar-whisky mix has to be higher in density than the slightly whipped cream. A pour over is likely too delicate (in taste and density). You also don't want coffee that's too strong (like espresso) because it would cover up most of the Whisky taste. Irish whisky tends to be lighter than Scotch or Bourbon. Add brown sugar to taste, but keep in mind that it is used to increase the density of the coffee-whisky mix as well, so one tablespoon should be added (for a glass of coffee as defined before). Well it's called Irish coffee, so I would use Irish whisky. However I'm sure it's worth experimenting with different whiskys, trying to fit them to the flavor profile of the coffee. If you have a very nutty, chocolaty Brazilian coffee, maybe a smoky, spicy Bourbon fits better. I don't know much about whisky though. I'd just try different things. If you are afraid of too much alcohol evaporating, you could just wait until the coffee is cooled down to below 79Â°C. You can't drink it before that anyways, it would be too hot. After brewing, add sugar to cool it down, then I would wait until it's somewhere around 75Â°C, add the whisky, which will cool it down even further. Guessing to just below 70Â°C. Add cream and drink. As said before, the cream should float on top without mixing with the coffee. Thus it has to be added after, which is usually done over the back of a spoon. It should be whipped lightly, but not too much either. You want it to be of a creamy, slightly aerated consistency. You drink the coffee through the cream. Here is a link to a recipe similar to what I wrote, although theirs has some twists like nutmeg in it."
How to prepare beans for grinding,"Coffee beans do need to be dried and roasted. Unroasted coffee beans will be green or very pale in colour, the beans in the photo have already been roasted and are ready to be used. The next step is to grind them, preferably just before making espresso or coffee. Ideally beans should be ground within two weeks of roasting. And ground just prior to actual use for best freshness and quality, although beans sold in stores (in vacuum sealed packages are sometimes a year old. Store beans in a tightly sealed container in a cool place to protect against moisture, air and light.  There is some rationale for storing beans in a freezer but it will not work well for most people. It's not normal to roast beans a second time and will almost certainly make for a worse result."
How to methodically pick out coffee nuances,"A well sourced coffee that has been properly roasted and brewed can be amazingly sweet. It's not the same kind of sweetness of cane sugar, but maybe milk is a better example. Milk is not entirely sweet when cold, but as soon as you heat it to around 130F, it's turns deliciously sweet. 
In any event, you will want a lighter roasted coffee. I think it can be a strange transition for people's pallets, especially for people that have been drinking a darker roasted coffee their whole lives, it becomes hard to identify a light coffee with the ""coffee taste."" A lighter roasted coffee preserves the sugars within the coffee, and brings out the wonderful acids and flavors that come from the fact that coffee is indeed the seed of a fruit. 
I think if I was you, I would purchase some coffee from a specialty coffee roaster (like: verve, ritual, 49 parallel, Intelligencia) and see if one of them really amazes you in any way, and then try and achieve that same roast profile. Other then that, don't always take those taste profiles to heart! They can certainly be different for anyone, and some often pretty silly.  Good luck!"
How does drinking coffee after a heavy meal counteract the drowsiness?,"I am by no means a biochemist/physiologist, but I will give this my best scientific go. The main reason people get sleepy after eating large meals, ""get the 'itis"" as many call it, simply has to do with homeostasis. The average person's diet usually consists mostly of carbohydrates. Carbs, especially when eaten in large quantities, causes a large spike in our blood sugar. In order for your body to bring the sugar levels back down to normal, the body releases insulin.  This stimulates movement of tryptophan (an amino acid in the brain), which then leads to the increased production of serotonin, a neurotransmitter responsible for sleep. And this increased level of serotonin triggers sleepiness after a meal. - See more at: http://blog.zocdoc.com/get-sleepy-meal-weird-science-daily-life/#sthash.fseXW9aA.dpuf Dangerously enough, constant spiking and falling of the blood sugar levels in the human body can lead to T2 Diabetes (most associated with processed sugars). Tryphtophan is the same amino that is found abundantly in turkey may be why some people take snoozes after large Thanksgiving day meals! Now, this brings us to the coffee portion. Coffee has caffeine which is a CNS stimulant. It increases blood pressure, metabolism, causes natriuresis (increase in saline secretion), but most obviously, may cause jitteriness, mild anxiety and alertness. This is because when caffeine is consumed, it antagonizes adenosine receptors; in other words, caffeine prevents adenosine from activating the receptor by blocking the location on the receptor where adenosine binds to it. As a result, caffeine temporarily prevents or relieves drowsiness, and thus maintains or restores alertness. It is not the blood in your body that affects sleepiness/alertness, rather the neurotransmitters and their chemical synapses
 TL;DR: After eating, your body is naturally producing neurotransmitters to bring your body to a state of homeostasis. When you ingest coffee, which contains caffeine, it counteracts this and keeps you awake and alert."
What factors should I change for a dark roast in an Aeropress?,"Dark roasts from an Aeropress easily become too bitter. I would recommend keeping the water temperature just below boiling. Flip your Aeropress upside down so that you can control the brew time. Add your beans and water, and then brew for 30-45 seconds. With lighter roasts, I do the above but let them brew much longer. I've found you have to adjust the brew time for darker roasts."
Should the filter capacity be matched to the brew amount?,I would agree with you.  With the thin flat layer of coffee the hot water is just pushing a hole right through it.  You are not getting nearly the contact time of a full size brew.   If it was conical or V shaped filter then it would better accommodate different size batches.   On that pot it does not look like you could just simply use a different filter size.
Office bean-to-cup machine tastes acidic in the morning,"My thought is that once you turn on the machine, the machine starts to heat the water. Often the heating system is regulated by a PID regulation (Maybe on-off regulation). The machine will heat the water fast to make sure you can get your cup of coffee:) Once the water is heated it will stabilize to the intended temperature. If the water is heated above the intended temperature it will cause acidic compounds to be extracted from the beans. After a while the temperature is stabilized and you will experience that the coffee is no longer acidic.  Another theory is that the pipes within the machine are not clean.  You can test both.  Try turning on the machine an hour before making the first cup. If this helps it is probably a temperature issue. If not try to clean the machine by running through hot water before making the first cup.  Hope one of these solutions will help you with your issue. ""Life is too short for bad coffee"""
Why do my Arabica beans smell and taste of burnt rubber?,"First thing to keep in mind is that taste varies from person, so you may try other beans/brews that have similar descriptions, so you can learn about your own taste perception. That been said, would be nice to know your equipment, in order to help you more. If you are using an espresso machine, maybe is time to have it cleaned. Mine was dirty a while ago and any beans would taste like burnt rubber, even light roasted ones. If you are using some infusion method (inverted aeropress or french press), try reducing the brewing time."
Does making Bali Coffee change the amount of caffeine compared to filter coffee?,"The amount of caffeine in your cup will depend, as with any method, on the extraction time. It also depends on everything else, e.g. the grind, temperature of the water, but I can't find any information on what these typically are for Balinese coffee, so I'm going to assume they're the same. Assuming you're using the same coffee with each method, the main thing that will vary is the extraction time. With pour-over methods, this will depend on the size and shape of the funnel, the porousness of the filter paper and the grind itself. For Balinese coffee, there is no control. If you mix the coffee and water directly, the only thing limiting the extraction time is how long you wait before drinking it. However, having said that, caffeine is actually extracted rather quickly. This study finds that routine percolation removes almost all soluble caffeine. However, the extended extraction time for Balinese coffee is likely to make a bitter brew. In conclusion, no, you won't get more caffeine in Balinese coffee compared to filter. Both methods will remove almost all caffeine from the coffee."
Does coffee affect people from all races the same?,"I do not consider myself an expert, but I do remember one study done on this. In ""The world of caffeine: The science culture and world's most popular drug,"" do indeed hypothesize that Japanese (and Asians in general) metabilise coffee slower than other races. So the effects of caffeine are felt longer."
Do I need to clean my drip brew coffee maker's filter every time?,"Looks like a standard metal mesh reusable filter! The mesh is probably stainless steel, perhaps with a gold-tinted coating, sandwiched between a plastic frame. They're alternatives to paper filters for filter/drip coffee. I find the outcome to be a little gritty/grainy; more like French press than a regular paper filter. In general, if your filter is still performing well, I think you're probably fine with a shake-out, rinse, or occasional scrub. However, any residue might impart off-tastes in your next brew (hopefully what's left is just coffee remnants!). The leftover coffee stuck to your filter (that you didn't wash off) will oxidise, taste stale, etc. (See also this question about coffee going stale -- one answer says it only takes minutes! And this question about what's happening with stale coffee.) Wet coffee grounds will mould if allowed to sit too long as you report. So if you leave coffee in it, very wet, for a long time, you might be inviting flora and fauna that you don't want. You reported this in your question, but I'm surprised if it would happen very quickly. Clearly, when you have mould growing, you'll want to give it a good scrub. If you store your filter (grounds knocked out, even if not washed) in such a way that the filter can dry out more quickly (e.g., hanging, separate from the coffee maker, propped up to permit air flow, etc.) it seems that mould would have a harder time to grow. As for getting clogged and occasionally needing a really thorough cleaning... I use a similar device for brewing tea, and it gets clogged sometimes. In fact, I wrote this question/answer on Cooking.SE recently about how it had become clogged after a decade of use; see that for more on how to get such a metal mesh really clean. A probably-obvious alternative is to use a paper filter. You could toss the whole thing into your compost bin (filter and spent grounds and all!) and everything on the coffee maker will dry out more quickly. "
Does coffee really reduce the risk of Alzheimer's?,"So there are a whole bunch of studies that have been done that have investigated a potential link between coffee consumption and Alzheimers. The problem, as always, is that these types of 'cohort studies' are really difficult. Basically the way it works is: All the standard stuff applies here: you are not testing for causation, only for correlation. For example, ~80% of Americans drink coffee, but in other cultures this number varies a lot. If the coffee drinkers in your study are predominantly American, and the non-coffee drinkers are predominantly not, you have a whole bunch of confounding factors. Designing your study to avoid this kind of situation is really hard, especially when you're relying on volunteers. There's also the issue of what exactly are you measuring? Someone might drink 3 cups a day now, but only has done for the past few years. Another person might drink 2 cups a day, but has done their whole life. Another person might drink 2 cups of decaff a day. Questionnaires are usually not sophisticated enough to capture this level of detail (partly because in your big expensive study you want to capture as much information about different behaviours as possible - not just coffee consumption). Remember also that medical studies are chronically badly reported in the mainstream press. Even in 'high-brow' publications, by the time the headline-writers get their hands on a study, the message can have changed wildly. It's always worth trying to dig up the actual paper whenever new research is mentioned in the news. If no paper is linked, just ignore the headline. One tool against all of this uncertainty is meta-analysis. This is where you look at every single study, weighted by how confident you are in the data (e.g. by weighting more to studies with more participants, and better questionnaires etc.). You then do some careful statistics work to get a measure of confidence across all of the studies. Think of it as a sophisticated way of 'averaging them out'. One of these was done in 2002. Only 4 studies had been done by then, but the conclusion was: Although our pooled estimates show that coffee consumption is inversely associated with the risk of AD, the four studies had heterogeneous methodologies and results. Further prospective studies evaluating the association between coffee consumption and AD are strongly needed. (Heterogeneous is science for 'different') i.e., ""Not sure yet, not enough data, but it looks promising, give us more money for research."""
How much French Press is a serving?,"FDA has no official guidelines on serving size, so your serving size is either determined by the product manufacturer, or whatever you want it to be. We don't know what brand french press you have but if it was Bodum for instance:  Coffee is measured in 4 oz. cups, so our 3-cup press will brew 12 oz.; a single serving."
When to use stirring to increase extraction?,"Stirring should be used if the grounds were not evenly dispersed in the beginning of the process for some reason (in immersion brewing methods).  For instance, when I am using my pour over at work, if my initial pour leaves some dry spots floating on top.  The Aeropress uses stirring prior to extraction presumably because the short time combined with the tube shape (narrow with all the grounds at the bottom) demand a good mixing.  I've seen many badly designed drip brewers that leave a chunk of dry grounds in the basket when done.  This is because the drip isn't dispersing water evenly and some of the grounds end up wasted,  finer grind, longer brew and temp won't necessarily help bad engineering in that case."
"French Press: Does ""plunge speed"" affect taste?","Plunging speed will only change the flavour in a minor way. Plunging slowly/carefully will prevent more sediment from getting through the filter as you push it down. Change in amount of sediment in your cup will change the mouth feel of your coffee, and may influence the flavour a little bit. I.e.: If there is too much sediment it may be more bitter. I have found I do not even need to plunge at all when making French Press, I have started simply carefully pouring the coffee out through the filter without plunging.  Link to cat video performing the French Press method described above. See answers to a previously posted question on this topic as well!"
Cold brew concentrate too light,Did you follow recipe procedures (with all due respect)? Good luck and let us know how it turns out? And I actually like the Starbucks cold brews.
What do these large bubbles in my French press indicate?,"The bubbles are the result of ""degassing"" â carbon dioxide escaping from the coffee. Degassing will be especially dramatic in the first 24 hours after roasting, during which 40% of the CO2 leaves the bean. See this blog post: Understanding Degassing."
Large scale cold brewing - Mesh bag technique - What size mesh is best?,I have had bags made up in China. 30cm x 30cm 100 micron is best for stepping. Put 5kgs of coffee in each bag and filter it a second time straight out of the tap. Ohhhh and never squeeze the bags.
Which decaffeination process changes the flavor of the coffee the least?,"Based on the article here and some brief experience with roasting decaf myself, I'd agree that the methylene chloride method seems to produce more flavorful beans.  That being said it's hard to make a direct comparison due to the difficulties in getting a single batch of beans and getting them processed for decaf at multiple facilities.  I think your best bet is to find a green coffee seller that you trust and see what they have to offer."
Nutrition information of roasting coffee in butter oil,"To answer your question, it all depends on what oil is used during the process, which can be found by just flipping the label over. Sugar is also used; it is very similar to searing something on a pan so there is no exact way to measure what % of the ingredients you used will be ""absorbed"" into the beans. The oil here is used to glaze the beans, which would then mix consistently when ground and brewed. I would refer to this answer similarly asked under Cooking-Exchange ....The... beans are generally roasted in what is referred to as ""butter oil"", which may or may not be actual clarified butter oil. Occasionally vegetable oils are used, and historically, traditional ""home-grown"" coffee roasting style involves creating almost a caramel-like coating effect with the use of a small amount of sugar, oil, and generally a touch of vanilla or cocoa. This coating blackens in the roast and the beans wind up with almost a thin, hard shell. Why is this done? Robusta beans are uniquely slow to ripen on the bush, and often pickers pick unripe beans along with ripe beans. The traditional coating gives all the beans a similar color. The presence of a few unripe beans does not hurt the overall taste effect of the blend. However, modern growers pick only ripe beans despite the extra labor, and do not feature this coating in their roasting, opting simple for a little oil to keep the beans easy to turn in the slow roasting process. Here you will find more information on how the technique for the beans are roasted. I hope helps answer your question"
What large batch cold brewing methods are available?,"It sounds like you're starting a small business, in which case, you will quickly outgrow 5 gallon batch sizes as you begin distribution.  Depending on your needs, I would suggest purchasing industrial beer brewing equipment, such as conical fermenters and brite tanks.   The conical fermenter would allow you to long brew a batch, bubble nitrogen or CO2 up from the bottom for agitation (increasing extraction and preventing oxidation), and will let the grinds settle into the bottom shoulder of the tank when the brewing process is complete.    Brite tanks come in a range of sizes from ~1 gallon up to tens of thousands of gallons. They are primarily used as a glycol jacketed pressure rated storage vessel for keeping beer (and similar beverages) in optimial conditions before storage. They may also be used as part of the forced carbonation of the liquid in the tank.  A brite tank will be useful for your cold brew business as you scale up because it will give you an intermediary vessel to blend out and store batches before packaging.  Depending on your business plans and packaging / distribution ability, 
you will probably want to start with a slightly larger setup that gives you 1) room to grow and 2) the ability to expand without changing process or systems. Beer equiptment is well suited to meet these goals.  The majority of consumers demand a consistent product with an interesting flavor-profile that they can enjoy every time they purchase your product. Flavor-profile deviations will cause you to loose consumers to a more consistent product in the long run. The following points will help ensure a more consistent product: "
How do I add cardamom to aeropress?,"You'll probably be able to get away simply with ground cardamom/cardamon added to the grounds when you're ""pre-infusing""/steeping the coffee grounds in the AeroPress. It's probably best to use very finely ground, freshly ground cardamom seeds. You may even wish to grind the cardamom seeds along with your coffee (i.e., in the grinder at the same time); you'll get similarly-fine grind. However, you might get a bit of cardamom flavour left over in the grinder; this may (not) be desirable. As another option, you could also consider a sprinkle of the dry, ground spice into the cup after brewing. In addition to cardamom or black cardamom, one might also consider cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, allspice, anise, or other ""baking spices."" Any of these could be used in a similar way. For example, I sometimes use freshly grated nutmeg in the grounds when brewing pour-over, and it gives a nice smell and a hint of flavour in the cup. You might also consider using an extract or essential oil or some high-intensity flavouring like that. You'd probably want to add that to your cup after brewing. I see a few problems that you might have to work around, specific to AeroPress, that you might run into with any of these spices. One problem you might encounter is the rather short infusion time commonly used in AeroPress; an option might be to try to steep the spice in the water as you're bringing it to the boil, but you risk burning the spice or otherwise contaminating the kettle (but might be worth a try to boil in a regular cooking pan). Another problem is that some spices have a rather strong hydrophobic tendency (specifically, cinnamon), so it might be necessary to stir the grounds more thoroughly than usual, to make sure the spices are infusing in the water. Also, these spices might leave behind some flavour in the AeroPress, so do consider washing thoroughly and soon after the brew. And you might get a hint of the spice next brew... so make sure it's something that you won't mind in the future! EDIT: More thoughts based on a later question: There's a few other suggestions from recipes like this and this (somewhat arbitrary top search hits). The former suggests using a French press / cafetiÃ¨re (providing longer steeping time for the spice) and the latter recommends grinding the spice with the coffee beans."
"Cezve doesn't leak with cold water in it, leaks after heating","If Cezve is made of copper, please get rid of it as soon as possible. Copper Oxide is quite poisonous. They are generally plated with tin after production. If you try to fix it, you may break this plating."
What happens to Colombian beans that do not make Supremo or Extra?,"They get sold for less money as ""standard export"" grade coffee.  Because of NFC's marketing campaign, ANY sort of Colombian coffee ends up with higher brand recollection than most other coffee.  There is a slightly slanted view of the matter here.  The writers are coffee aficionados who prize distinctive origin flavors in their coffee, which is rarely present in NFC graded coffee since they are more often than not mixed batches of beans from different growers.  That isn't to say that the NFC's work doesn't ensure high standards for Colombian exports, but it isn't favorable to some sectors of the coffee market who prize distinct coffee from a single origin.

Can coffee pods be brewed in cup?,"The way I understand your explanation this should, in essence, make a turkish brew. In other words, it can be done, no problem. The thing to consider would be your personal preference; not everyone likes to have their grounds swimming in their coffee, so as mentioned in the comments, pouring the insides into a drip filter might be an option to consider. If you do however decide for a turkish brew, remember to let it sit for a while so all the grounds settle at the bottom, and don't drink the last part (where the grounds will be)*. *Or do, if you really want to. Almost no one does this as it tastes horrible, but my grandma actually used to eat the grounds at the bottom with some sugar, so I guess exceptions exist... "
"Shaken, not stirred","Probably not, although more possible for financial reasons.  Shaking a coffee drink would either require a more sturdily constructed disposable cup, which would cost more money and create even more waste or a reusable shaker which would require cleaning in between customers which would cost money and time making the drink.  Either method would also incur a significant risk of losing the prepared drink in its entirety, necessitating a restart.  For a business, it's much less risky to simply let you customers stir their drinks."
Slow Roasting Coffee Beans,"I have had no success at low temperature roasting, I have gone through a number of hacked popcorn popper coffee roasters. This requires some tweaking to get the temperature high enough to get a good roast. As a result, I have wasted a few pounds of beans on âlowânâslowâ roasts. If you leave the beans in long enough, they will turn dark. But they never develop robust coffee flavor. A green bean has no flavor. Lots of caffeine, but no flavor. It is the roasting process which converts bean constituents into yummy coffee-flavored chemicals. The Maillard Reaction is a specific reaction between amino acids (building blocks of protein) and reducing sugars. It produces specific chemicals like 3-deoxyhexosulose. These products do not provide coffee flavors. Which is good because otherwise your bread and French fries would taste like coffee. If you roast beans at Maillard temperatures, you will have brown beans that taste like dark toast. But we donât drink coffee because it tastes like toast. We drink it because it tastes like coffee. I have given up on popcorn popper roasters. They donât stand up to proper coffee roasting temperatures. I have switched to a BBQ rotisserie basket. With an eye on the thermometer, it does a very good job and leaves the stinky smoke outside."
Caffeine content of different brewing methods,"Short answer: No Slightly longer answer: The temperature, pressure and method of brewing barely impact the amount of caffeine extracted from the bean. Because caffeine dissolves so readily in hot water, the single most important factor in determining the amount of caffeine in the cup is the amount of coffee used to prepare said cup. Arabica beans contain about 0.8-1.4% of caffeine by weight, depending on the variety. So if you were to brew an espresso (15g in 30g out) or a pour over (15g in 250g out), you would have the same amount of caffeine in each beverage."
How does a snack with a coffee slow down the caffeine's effect?,"It's probably due to the fact that your organism has nutriments from the snack to absorb at the same time , if everything mixs in your stomach then absorbtion will also be mixed . It's pretty much the same with alcohol."
History of short and tall sizes,"The Short, Tall, and other sizing names are adopted by Starbucks to denote their own serving sizes. Any use in terms of coffee-serving sizes were coined initially by Starbucks which subsequently led to other coffee shops following suit as an established method.

Costa also uses a different size-naming convention based off of Italian words."

Darker roasts may have 10-15% less.  ...dark roasts have a stronger taste, but the roasting procedure they experience decreases their caffeine content by 10 to 15 percent. If you prefer dark roasted beans, congratulations! They basically contain 15% to 20% less caffeine than the lightly roasted ones. In the answers to this Question there is plenty of information about this subject. "
How does Caffeine-free coffee affect your body?,"I personally couldn't taste any difference between decaf and regular coffee but depends on the brand. According to some resources is decaf the biggest source of antioxidants in the western diet and it has positive impact on health if you drink 2-3 cups per day. From my personal experience, you can drink probably as much decaf as you want since it doesn't have any negative side effects, regarding regular coffee you might get breath problems and high blood pressure if you drink too much. There are lot of good brands of decaf where you don't taste any difference between it and regular coffee. sources: https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/decaf-coffee-good-or-bad https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325502.php https://greatist.com/eat/is-drinking-decaf-coffee-better-for-you"
Cold brewing at varying temperatures - How does steeping temperature affect extraction?,"Okay, so what if I told you, that I sell a lot of cold brew at my shop, and have had success with 4-hour steeps.  I've tried a bunch of stuff, and I've realized that since the temp is really low (mild to cold), it barely makes a difference in TASTE. The biggest factor is oversteeping (like, 48hours up brew), as it can make your cold brew sour. But as a rule of thumb and for sanity of the production team, I go for cold water and steep for 8-15 hours, depending on the time of day it's made."
"Roast Profile vs Rest Time, any connection?","This relationship is often discussed on coffee websites that I visit, such as such as http://www.home-barista.com and http://www.greencoffeebuyingclub.com. I have had a similar experience, although my roast times are much shorter than yours (typically 11-12 minutes total).  I roast 3-4 coffees each week. Based on my own taste buds, coffees that are roasted closer to second crack are ready much sooner. I measure the length of time that I roast from the start of first crack. Here are some of the timing / aging notes for my recent roasts"
Is there any way to preserve roasted coffee beans?,"Coffee beans, once roasted, are perishable; they don't ""keep"". Within roughly five days of roasting staleness is detectable (taste/quality is adversely affected). There is one way to preserve freshness: consume freshly roasted beans within roughly a week. Don't freeze; beans absorb moisture and lose flavourâ ick. Vacuum packs aren't the answer, either. To remove all gases from packaging would require a system using pressure, 29"" Hg, that no one, not even coffee giants, can afford. The best practice is to just buy beans (roasted on the day you purchase, ideally) in quantities you'll use within a week to 10 days. "
how to make French Press coffee the right way?,Is it possible that you read a few posts on the Internet the wrong way?
Why is coffee mostly hot brewed?,"Let's take a look at what turns coffee grounds and water into coffee: It's an extraction process where aromatic compounds and oils and caffeine are extracted from the coffee bean into the water. It's a ""standard chemical process"", done in millions of kitchens and cafÃ©s all over the world. Basic chemistry will tell you that the temperature of the solvent and other environmental parameters like pressure typically determine how fast this happens, but also the ratios of extracted substances, if applicable. Surface area comes into play as well, that's why e.g. coffee for espresso machines is ground finer than for filter machines. Using the same batch of beans in an espresso machine and a drip coffee maker gives you two totally different taste profiles. The same applies for extraction processes that use cold water, a method termed ""cold brew"" and discussed on this site as well. By the same rules as explained before, this means you need significantly longer extraction times (we are talking hours here) and should expect a different taste."
Keurig Coffee Maker gets clogged and slow,"Due to the age and usage of your Keurig machine, I would say that you are experiencing two possible problems - one at a time or perhaps both. The Problems: The motor in the pump in your Keurig machine may simply just be getting worn out. If this is the problem, you should be able to hear it struggling to pump water out through the K-Cup. If you need a comparison, try comparing it to a newer model and see how it sounds. If de-scaling (see next problem) does not work, then you may need to replace the motor/pump. It may just be easier at that point to buy a new Keurig machine. The machine seriously needs to be de-scaled. I would recommend running a solution of 25% lemon juice and 75% water through the machine. Make sure to run around 250 - 500 mL (about one to two cups) of this solution from the tank all the way through to a cup. Then rinse with atleast 1 L of of normal water (about 4 cups). As I have stated in other answers, breathing the fumes from this can be extremely dangerous for your mucosa (parts of the eyes, nose, mouth, throat, respiratory tract, and lungs). Do not breathe in the steam or fumes.  This is not a huge concern with lemon juice (which is why I recommend it), but if you were to use vinegar or a commercial de-scaler, this would be a huge concern.  Just be smart about it. You don't want to end up with permanent damage to your respiratory tract. Other possible problems (harder to fix): It could be possible that a seal somewhere in the pump has worn out and air is entering the system as it is being pumped. This would involve replacing a seal and taking the machine apart though. There may be some other component, that I can't think of, that is damaged. Try the above solutions and leave a comment. Let me know if anything works."
Coffee ground too finely - how to deal with it?,"In this case, my usual pre-coffee tiredness solved the problem: I had planned to mix the espresso grind with my usual grind to minimize the total amount of grounds in the cup. The idea was  Being tired, I only remembered this when I had already filled the moka more than half-way with the too-fine grind, so I just topped it up with the other kind and coooked my coffee.   But lo and behold: There were no coarse grounds in my pot - just some super-fine ones that weren't noticeable. I have since repeated the experiment a few times and can confirm that a top layer of ""just right"" grounds seems to be able to hold back most of the too-fine crumbs, especially those responsible for the ""gritty"" mouthfeel.  A top layer of 1/4th to 1/3rd of the correct grind proved sufficient as ""filter"" in my experiments.  Also, there is no excess clogging of the moka, causing the valve to trigger or hot steam/water escaping round the gasket. The pot works just as usual. Of course one may not compact the coffee grounds in the brewing chamber, but that's standard procedure."
How much weight reduction occurs after roasting coffee beans?,"The roasting process leads to water loss in all types of beans. Most beans start off at about 10-12% moisture and end up around 3%.
My experience gives about 15% weight loss (shrinkage) for light roasts and around 20% on dark roast profiles. Example of a dark roast weight loss in my roasterie would be: 
Starting weight: 240#
Roasted weight: 195#
Shrinkage = 195/240 = 81% of start weight so 19% loss. I can't seem to find any online documentation of this. Just daily experience of being a professional roaster."
Coffee will make you lean?,"I think caffeine canÂ´t make you lean if you eat well & health food, and of course doing some exercises, gym, jogging etc. Caffeine is most consumed psychoactive drug, legal of course(more at wiki). Also, I like to start day with warm cup of coffee. :) Btw, about year ago I use caffeine pills (200mg pure caffeine per pill , it really have effect, adrenaline increases, you feel energy). Than and today, when I donÂ´t consumed this pills anymore, I have almost same weight. 
A suggest you to eat food which contains proteins, avoid too much (white) sugar etc."
Will my tap water work for brewing espresso?,"Provided that you descale your machine whenever needed, your machine should not take damage from using tap water. Since your tap water is also safe to drink, this leaves taste as the only reason for concern. Dealing with this question is simple: just make a direct comparison between bottled-water espresso and tap water espresso. Check if you taste any noticeable differences. If this is not the case, the tap water should be fine. While there may be ""guidelines for taste"" as far as the tap water vs. bottled water question is concerned (e.g., softer water is typically better), what tastes good and what does not is a very complex question - so the tasting is the only way to be sure. Note that you will need to descale your machine from time to time in both cases - so using bottled water to avoid descaling is probably not cost-effective (nor environmental friendly)."
Are high-end cone grinders adjustable?,"Yes, high end grinders are generally adjustable. Some even have macro and micro adjustments. For example the Baratza Vario grinder  Hand grinders are also adjustable, and provide a good grind. See the Hario range The larger commercial grinders are sometimes aimed more at bulk output than at a precise and consistent grind. They grind the coffee very quickly, which may not be the quality you are looking for. Some people prefer grinders that operate at a lower speed so that the temperature of the burrs stays low, reducing the chance of the grind getting over roasted Here's a list of mid to high end grinders. You will notice that they all have adjustments."
What causes the stains around the cup when coffee is prepared with cafetiere (French press)?,"I could think of two possibilities. First one is more common, I assume. In time, the cup calcifies. So, some irregularities causes an unpolished surface. This surface catches color easier than polished ceramic/porcelain. You may try to clean the cup with vinegar. Maybe then with some bleach to get rid of such calcification and organic irregularities. Give it a try. If the grounds you use includes finer grounds that can pass through the filter, you may end up with a muddier-than-normal French press cup. Those fine grounds may swim on top of the water and leave some trace. If this is the case, make sure about your grind size and consistency."
Is it necessary to keep a portafilter in the grouphead when not in use?,"Keeping the portafilter warm (and receiving / tamping a dose within a warm portafilter) is supposed to result in additional oils being released in the extraction, which in theory leads to a fuller pull and more crema. It's also supposed to add to the benefits of pre-infusion. I have experimented at length with this, and can detect positively no difference between a shot extracted from a cold filter, and one extracted from a warmed one. It might only be noticeable on higher-end (larger) machines, or simply larger filters.  Mechanically, it's a sound enough practice as it would help keep the group head and portafilter from warping independently, even ever so slightly. Even though the seal they make is assisted by the inclined plane the filter travles to reach the head, it's still good for the filter to mate properly with the machine. I asked my barista about this after Joel mentioned it, and he also said it's a good practice to keep.  tl;dr; It can't hurt, and it might help, but YMMV on lesser machines. edit Experiments in various presses, and the amount of crema they produce have shown that pre-warming metal filters produces more crema. This eluded me because I own a pretty good machine that heats the filter quickly after it has been attached to the machine. The accuracy would depend on your machine. The result could be more crema, and everything that a fuller extraction entails.  suggestion Try it on your machine and see if it makes a detectable difference."
Is there any process after roasting coffee?,"Typically after roasting coffee there is a rest period during which you don't want to use the coffee. Roughly 85-90% of carbon dioxide contained in a coffee bean after roasting will be released in the first 24 hours.  You CAN immediately brew coffee with fresh roasted coffee, but the flavors will not be fully developed, and you might get a metallic taste in your brewed coffee which is a side effect of the carbon dioxide. At my shop, we allow the coffee to rest for 12 hours before grinding for the customer, and we don't cup coffees until they have rested for a minimum 12 hours.   Additionally, there are some coffees that benefit from longer rest times.  Some recommend up to 10 days rest time for espresso because you will get higher extraction yields (tds yields) after a long rest period (per Scott Rao who is an expert on the subject).  Other coffees like some Ethiopians will develop more pronounced floral / berry flavors after a slightly longer rest period of around 5 days (recommended by Joe Marocco over at Cafe Imports if I recall correctly) Other than this rest period and grinding, there is no process that needs to be accomplished after roasting coffee. "
Should I press the coffee into my espresso machine?,"The process of compressing the coffee powder in a portafilter of an espresso machine before pulling the shot is called tamping. There is a lot of information available on the web explaining how it is done correctly, such as, e.g., here. Tamping is an important part of making a good espresso shot, so yes, you should press the coffee in the portafilter. The reason for compressing the coffee powder is to allow the pump to build up the pressure needed for brewing espresso correctly. If you don't tamp it, there is typically not enough resistance and the water rushes through the portafilter too quickly, resulting in underextraction of the coffee powder (and hence, suboptimal taste). Furthermore, a good tamp prevents channelling, where the water does not flow well-distributed through the coffee powder. If the coffee drips too slowly when you tamp, a couple of things can be tried: Options two and three are only listed for the sake of completeness - normally the tamper force is adapted to the other variables, and not the other way around. A good espresso making tutorial should give you a starting point on how to find the correct tamping force and grind coarseness level for your combination of beans and machine. Also, if you own an espresso machine and never heard of tamping, you may want to read one anyway."
Used Keurig smells and tastes like cigarettes,"First of all, note that the smell of the machine itself is unlikely to come from the interior of the parts that heat and transport water -- after all, they are regularly cleaned with hot water and smoke has a hard time getting there. So running vinegar through the machine won't change that. Rather, it is the other surfaces that cause problems. Thoroughly cleaning all surfaces of the machine may help a little bit (including the easily accessible ones behind the cover), and storing it in a room that is thoroughly aired for some months should also help to some extent. Depending on the temperature, a garage may also be an option. You need to be careful to not break the machine during cleaning and airing, though. "
What makes Brazilian coffee unique compared to coffee from other countries?,"Brazil is unique in that it is the largest producer of coffee, but it is also unique in that it produces a huge volume of dry processed coffee.  Dry processing is not unheard of, but is much rarer in other countries. Dry processing produces a coffee that IS different than most other processing methods. The coffee tends to roast differently and also produces much more chaff when roasting.  It also tends to have a different flavor profile than the same coffee processed differently. Many countries or regions will espouse the benefits of their method of processing, but there are other factors that greatly affect the reasons for choosing a particular method.  High humidity or rainfall areas will generally have a hard time dry processing coffee.  More labor intensive methods may be unfavorable in areas where labor is not had cheaply.  Water intensive methods will be undesirable in frequent drought areas or areas where water is expensive. Brazil is somewhat synonymous with dry processing.  My roaster has a line on it for ""Brazil"" coffee.  What it really means is dry processed coffee.  Filling the roaster with dry processed beans past the line will overload the unit's ability to get rid of chaff as fast as it is produced and ruin the roast.  But even in the equipment manufacturers world, the two mean the same thing."
Light-colored matter clinging to roasted coffee beans,"What you are likely seeing is the silverskin of the coffee cherry.  Green coffee beans prior to roasting generally still have the silverskin intact/attached.  As the bean expands during roasting and the silverskin dries out, it generally comes off.  Part of the roasting process is some sort of agitation and airflow to remove this chaff.  Depending on the roast level and other mechanical factors, more or less of the silverskin may be removed.  On lighter roasted coffee with less expansion you can often see bits of silverskin along the seam on the bean.  Some processing methods prior to roasting also remove less of the silverskin, ""dry processed"" coffee in particular tends to be more chaffy when roasting and may require a longer time agitating or smaller roast batches to remove chaff.   Many of my lighter roasts end up with a bit more chaff than I'd like.  Like most anything involving coffee, you can find differing opinions on how much it affects taste.  "
What is the correct way to eat biscotti with coffee?,"Adapting ""Golf is a good walk spoiled,"" (whoever said it; Twain probably didn't), biscotti is a sure way to destroy a good coffee.  Italians dip in wine instead, not in coffee according to that article. Dipping in that wine sounds marginally worse than dunking in coffee. The soft, cookie-like biscotti available in many cafes won't hold up to any dunking at all, and will end up waterlogged and sad at the end of your sipping. The break-your-teeth traditional biscotti seem to call for something, but they don't seem edible to me. I prefer the middle-of-the-road, softer, chewy biscotti that can be enjoyed without submerging in liquid. At the risk of this becoming an opinion-based discussion, for my money: If you want to drink coffee, just drink coffee.  If you want to eat a soggy cookie, eat a soggy cookie... but don't combine the two and risk ruining your perfectly good coffee in the process. :)"
Can you use sparkling water to brew coffee?,"If you heat the water as per most brewing methods, it would no longer be carbonated/sparkling by the time you brewed with it. You would thus be confined to a cold-brew method, and if you wanted the water to remain carbonated you'd have to cold brew in a sealed container. That would be moderately inconvenient but should be possible.  Or you could brew coffee by any means and force carbonate it after the fact, which would thus have no effect on the brewing. Never tried it, don't find the idea personally interesting, but all it should cost you to try would be a bottle of sparking water and the hassle of getting the coffee grounds into it, waiting a day or so, and then pouring it out through a filter and cleaning up the mess before recycling the bottle. Please report your results."
Typical set up/menu for farmer's market coffee stand?,"Off the top of my head (by no means exhaustive): You want two groups in case something goes wrong with one of them, you're not out of business. You also want to be able to use the steam wands while extracting, so the need for each group to have a double boiler is pretty big. Instead of one machine that costs a ton, you can get two machines (each with one group and a double boiler) that cost anywhere from $1000 to $3500 instead. Try not to go with home appliances - even though I have nothing but great things to say about Breville, they aren't designed for that kind of continuous duty cycle. Redundancy is not all that's important, you need to be able to make more than one drink at a time :) Dose control gives you consistency. And you need to be able to grind as many beans as you plan to offer without cleaning grinders each time. These can get insanely expensive as you get into features like auto tamping - the biggest thing to look for is accurate dose control. I recommend a model that fires once you stick a portafilter under it, with a button to extract into a pitcher. They sometimes come with a small stand to tamp, if not, grab some of them (if not auto-tamping). I don't recommend using a cooler with ice for dairy - it's going to start off as too cold and work its way up to being too warm. A small dorm-size fridge would be better, and cheap enough that you can have a backup you can run home to get if you need it. Get a good fridge thermometer to figure out the ideal setting for the fridge (usually a dial between 0 and 9), mark it with a sharpie once you get around 35 degrees Fahrenheit (don't buy one that won't go below 40 degrees). Remember that fridges have cold spots, so measure at the bottom as well as near the coils (where the ice lives). You also need refrigeration for you, too. Nothing says gross like sweat falling into coffee! An evaporative air cooler, or at least some fans really help. Your pour-over setup, some presses, tables, rubber mats, pitchers, various kinds of spoons, condiment / syrup dispensers, napkins, etc. Don't forget cups, sleeves, alternative sweeteners (be nice, buy honey from a vendor there, helps business). Also, don't forget corrugated trays (recycled) for large orders. You can also never have enough cotton bar mop rags. Don't forget a camping stove or induction cooker, and if you use an induction cooker, make sure everything you need to put on it will work. If you're going to be blending stuff, get a good blender that can eat through ice easily. Another thing that's nice to have two of in case one breaks. Don't forget, you need to be able to wash your hands. Sanitizer is good, but having a basin and bucket is also helpful. And, don't forget whack-buckets, trash cans, etc. This is really important. Imagine you have 20 people lined up and 10 orders going. Make sure you know what people ordered, what needs to go out next, and that the tickets are clear. Soy instead of whole milk? Make sure the person making the drink knows that, and that it goes to the right person. POS (point of sale) systems are increasingly cheap and really help with this. But old fashioned pen and paper tickets work well too, if you have a system in place. This is a really bad way a great setup can fail if you don't get it right. You're going to need some big plastic bladders full of clean filtered water. You'll also need to make sure it's possible to get that water into the coffee machines easily :) Transporting that much water can be a challenge because it can get so heavy that applying the breaks in a normal vehicle takes on a whole new dynamic. Got a place that delivers it? Make sure you do a dry run, that's the only way you'll be sure you have everything you need. Everything else is pretty unique to what you want to offer, but if you keep it simple it's not too bad. If you're going to offer cakes and snacks, have a way to keep them fresh. Keep it simple and keep it confined to what you can make consistently well. Tell people they're welcome to ask, but avoid anything super complicated from becoming a permanent fixture on the menu. You should charge 3x your cost to be safe, 2 - 2.5x if you want or need to be really competitive. 3x is pretty certain to cover your costs, overhead, and profit. You need to know how much it costs you to make every single thing, how much it costs to just open and tear down, and everything else. Another great reason for keeping a simple (10 things is good) menu."
What makes a successful coffee shop?,"You're going to have to understand the market of the local area of where you intend to have your coffee shop. When starting out, I highly doubt people from miles away would travel just to receive a cup of coffee from your shop. So before you've been able to establish a brand you'll need to start somewhere, and that is providing for the local community. An unfortunate observation of mine is that it seems as though there is a majority of people who do not actually know what a good cup of coffee is like nor do they care; it's all about the caffeine fix or the environment of the shop itself. Very few people will be extreme critics of the quality of your coffee and depending on where you wish to be located you may be targeting the busy commuter that pops in to get his fix, or the chill artist that wants a relaxing environment. Target your local area and find out what people like and what ideal direction you want your coffee shop to be going in i.e. do you want to open more stores elsewhere? Do you want to become a brand that also roasts it's own coffee and makes blends? Know what direction you want to go in should help mold what your coffee shop evolves into and what type of customer you will target."
What is the appropriate climate for a coffee plant?,"I found this website which prescribes the following subtropic and equatorial growing conditions. The subtropical regions, at high altitudes of 16-24Â° (Illy, 21). 
  Rainy and dry seasons must be well defined, and altitude must be
  between 1800-3600 feet.  These conditions result in one coffee growing
  season and one maturation season, usually in the coldest part of
  autumn.  Mexico, Jamaica, the S. Paulo and Minas Gerais regions in
  Brazil, and Zimbabwe are examples of areas with these climate
  conditions (Illy, 21). The equatorial regions at latitudes lower than 10Â° and altitudes of
  3600-6300 feet (Illy, 21).  Frequent rainfall causes almost continuous
  flowering, which results in two coffee harvesting seasons.  The period
  of highest rainfall determines the main harvesting period, while the
  period of least rainfall determines the second harvest season. Because
  rainfall is too frequent for patio drying to occur,  artificial drying
  with mechanical dryers is performed in this type of coffee growing
  environment. Examples of countries that have this climate are Kenya,
  Colombia, and Ethiopia (Illy, 21)."
