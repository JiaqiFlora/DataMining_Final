Do pigs eat mushrooms [closed],"Yes pigs eat mushrooms, including domestic pet pigs. All pigs are omnivores, that gather and root for food. As a seasoned mushroom forager who knows her woods very well, I can confirm that wild boars most definitely eat wild mushrooms, as part of their diet - or in other words, on their treks where they pretty much till a forest floor on their search for roots and grubs, they will also eat whatever is growing on the top, including berries and mushrooms. Domesticated pigs have the same dietary habits as wild boars. I would strongly advise against taking Nintendo games as depicting or mimicking the real world. But that’s true for many games and other forms of storytelling. It’s called “fiction” for a reason."
Is it okay to use an extremely diluted essential oil pillow spray if I have cats?,"Personally, I would avoid spraying the oil anywhere a cat could touch. Oil doesn't evaporate as quickly as water, so even hours of spraying your pillow, there are probably traces of the essential oils left on the fabric. Cats can actually absorb these traces via the skin on their feet, but at a very slow rate. The problem with most essential oils is that cats don't produce the enzymes to metabolize or neutralize them. So even trace amounts can accumulate over a long time. By the time your cat shows any symptoms, you probably won't think about essential oil poisoning because you've always used the spray and nothing ever happened, until now. So my suggestion is to apply the spray to a piece of cloth (like a handkerchif) close to your head, but not touching your pillow or bed. One more safety layer is to drip the spray onto the cloth instead of spraying it, to avoid spreading the essential oil to surrounding surfaces. If you want to go super safe and fancy at the same time, consider an incense bowl with a lid that lets the aroma spray evaporate but doesn't let your cats touch the cloth inside. These are some random examples of incense bowls I found in various online shops, I'm not affiliated with any of them:

Why is the cat coming repeatedly? Why is it only yowling at our black cat? Is it just to fight?,"Territory argument. They'll settle it with posturing and swatting and other lower-risk interactions if they can, since neither wants to get into a serious fight. But your cat is an intruder in the established social patterns and this will go on until everyone agrees where he fits. If he's intact, expect more serious arguments than if he's neutered. All you can do is try to support him when you see negotiations starting, break up any fights that look serious, and treat any injuries. They'll probably be minor, if any. Or tell him that he's now an indoor cat."
Are AirTags safe for pets?,"AirTags contain batteries. There are numerous reports of dogs swallowing them. Generally, it should pass through them, but if the tag is damaged before swallowing, the acid in the battery could be a concern. Additional consideration should be given if your dog does a lot of playing with other dogs. Rabies tags and other tags typically worn on the collar are generally all metal and not likely to be torn or chewed apart, whereas many AirTag collar holders are very susceptible to damage. Many dogs (including mine) will bite at the neck or collar during play and this could be a concern. If you do get one, ensure it is more securely attached to the collar and not dangling."
Young dog has begun persistent attention-seeking behavior in the evening,"Definitely seems like you're doing a lot of the right things, including a vet visit to rule out any health issues. I've worked with a vet behavior specialist for similar issues with my dog, so I'll offer some suggestions based on my experience: Exercise is really great for your dog, and it's good that you're doing this throughout the day and not just once and done. (I have an Aussie, so I'm familiar with the battle to burn off energy.) But exercise is also super exciting for dogs especially when it involves extra stimulation like a dog park or neighborhood walks where they get more interaction with the outside world. Some dogs need a winddown activity to help them transition from the fun, exciting thing to the relaxation period. Things I do after exercising my dog: treat scatter: throw a handful (or two) of Cheerios or other low-calorie treats around on the floor for your dog to get. This can also be his dinner kibble, just exclude that portion from what he gets in his bowl. The act of sniffing can help ease dogs' excitement, plus they can start to establish this as a routine: exercise, treat scatter, settle down. chewing activity: chewing is another way dogs regulate their emotions, so initiating chewing a safe item like a bone is another great transitional activity. My dog, despite being 40lbs, is a total lap dog, so he likes to chew his bone while in my lap. But even sitting with your dog, petting him (if he's ok with that) can help him settle down with your (calm) attention and affection. licky mat: again, licking helps dogs regulate and offers a distraction. You can start with peanut butter or yogurt depending on your dog's preferences/dietary needs, but for an added 'challenge' you can also freeze the spread ahead of time so the dog has to work a little harder to get the treat. I'd do this after your dog has established a good routine with the licky mat because you don't want to frustrate him. I use silicone mats that can be thrown in the dishwasher. If your dog chews/eats the mat itself, you can also try a stainless steel tray or bowl (avoid non-stick pans and metal coatings that can be hazardous to dogs). There is one other option that requires more time and training but can be worth it: a relaxation mat. Establish a blanket/mat (I use an old yoga mat) that is the dog's only and for relaxation purposes only. It shouldn't stay out and always be available to him. Over time, you train him to go to the mat and relax. This is achieved through a lot of iterations that basically go like this: You'll also want to remove any opportunity for him to do the attention-seeking behavior you've listed (which it sounds like you're already starting to do for certain things). Use baby gates if you have to to keep him away from the counters. I know this is easier said than done, but removing the opportunity can help break the habit along with helping him soothe and relax for the evening. Best of luck!"
My 30lb Catahoula ripped open a pack of instant yeast,"No, you should most likely be fine. Yeast can be everywhere. Yeast is everywhere. If some old fruits or bread go bad it's very possible yeast is involved, too. So your dog will inevitably eat or inhale tiny amounts of different cultures all the time anyway. Second, a dog's stomach acid is very aggressive, way more aggressive than that of humans. The smaller the amounts of yeast are, the less likely any would survive for long. Last but not least, yeast requires some form of carbohydrates or sugars to grow significantly. As long as you don't feed any amount of sugars (might be included in some dog treats), it will simply starve to death while being digested. With these points in mind, I'd say the chances of any health complications are rather slim and next to impossible. Eating a pile of dough (which would include ""food"" for the yeast and more mass/volume to somewhat protect from acid) would be way worse, but also depending on the amount, likely harmless. In fact, my dog stole a significant piece of fresh pizza dough as a puppy with basically no effects. Just keep an eye on your dog and contact your vet in case there's any abnormal behavior the next 1-2 days, but I really wouldn't worry too much about this."
Help identify baby snail,"It's probably a red ramshorn, and they're generally harmless but can become prolific under the right conditions. In a well-aerated tank the worst they'll do is require you to change your filter a little more often due to excretion, so I wouldn't worry about it. It's extremely difficult to identify the snail from the single photo you took, especially without additional angles on the shell. However, the spiral shape and red coloring of the flesh make it likely that it's a red ramshorn snail similar to this one:  Image Credit: Catxx, CC BY-SA 3.0, via Wikimedia Commons Ramshorn snails are rarely harmful to an aquarium or its plant or animal inhabitants. In large numbers they can gum up filters with their excretions, but that's true of most snails because snails excrete a lot. They can also throw off your nitrogen cycle or raise ammonia levels if there's a sudden mass die-off, and dead snails do leave shells lying around—that can balance kH but just looks messy. Mostly, though, they breed to the level of available uneaten food in the tank; if your tank is being overrun by them, then you're probably overfeeding the tank anyway. Anecdotally, I have a 10 gallon heavily-planted aquarium that currently has no other inhabitants. In my personal opinion, 5 gallons is too small for even a single mystery snail, especially as they like to climb. In contrast, if you like snails the ramshorns need almost no maintenance except a little spirulina or chlorella added to the tank from time to time to stay healthy in water that has a reasonable amount of calcium. If you have a healthy mystery snail, which requires high pH and enough calcium carbonate to grow to full size, the ramshorns won't need anything additional. They're pretty hardy, don't care much about pH, and if you don't feel the need to cull them you can mostly just ignore them. They won't bother the mystery snail, but might occasionally hitch rides on it as everyone moves around the tank. I happen to like ramshorns, but not everyone does. If you want to remove it, I'd do it sooner rather than later because they are hermaphroditic and can breed a lot faster than you think, especially if you overfeed your aquarium. Otherwise, take it as a life lesson to properly isolate and treat new plants before adding them to your aquarium in future. Ramshorns aren't really a problem, but other hitchhikers can be such as scuds, hydra, or leeches. Some pests can be almost impossible to eliminate from a populated tank, especially with more sensitive inhabitants like nerite or mystery snails, but ramshorns are neither hard to manage nor harmful, so it's up to you whether or not to leave it alone."
Can a neutered Jack Russell and a intact husky live in the same household,"This is going to depend on so many more factors than breed and being neutered or not. Ultimately, you have to either know or find out how your dog reacts to other dogs in “his”territory, how both are with other dogs in general and finally, just like with humans, whether those two individuals get along or not. If you can predict problems based on the first two points, I’d recommend you experiment carefully, simply because the size difference can, in case of a serious escalation, be very dangerous for the smaller dog - that the average Jack Russel is tenacious and slightly megalomaniac doesn’t help. On the other hand, it’s always an individual case, dog A and dog B with their specific characters and quirks. When you bring them together, plan for management in the first phase, just to be sure. If you are not familiar with the topic, I very much recommend you learn about the subtle ways dog communicate, their body language etc. This will help you read and understand what’s happening between the two and recognize potential escalations early on."
"I locked my 4 kittens in a room to get them used to using a litter box, they have food and water","If the litter box stinks, it needs to be cleaned! Imagine how unpleasant it would be for you to have to use a stinky and dirty toilet. So the first step to get your kittens to use their litter box is to clean it several times each day. Removing the clumbs should suffice most days. When it starts stinking, you should empty it and rinse it with water and some dishwashing liquid. The rule of thumb for multi-pet households is to provide one litter box for each cat plus one extra. That is probably overkill for 4 kittens, but you get the idea: when one box is used and the kittens search for an alternative, having one more box is better than having them pee in a corner. If you let them back into the house, keep them in a limited space (like 1 - 2 rooms) and put several litter boxes in there. Some kittens also need supervision for a while. Whenever you see one kitten pee or poop outside of a litter box, immediately lift it up and put it in a litter box as quickly as possible. Don't scold or punish the kitten in any way or it might never learn to use the litter box properly.
You should also clean the old pee spots with a special enzymatic cleaner. If the kittens smell old pee they assume that this is the correct spot to pee again. You can find cat urine with a UV flashlight. The type of litter boxes can also be a problem. How high is the edge of your current box? If it's too hard for the kittens to climb into he box, they won't want to use it. Some cats also dislike litter boxes with a lid. And lastly, what type of cat litter do you use? Coarse grain litter might be uncomfortable for tiny kitten paws. You can try different types of litter in different litter boxes and see which one your kittens like best."
What is this growth in my dog's ear?,Has the vet seen this photo? I'm not sure what this is but if this were in my dogs ear I'd want to take it back to the vet. From this photo alone those look like larvae or maggots to me? I'm sure it's a pain that you've had to go back to the vet constantly but I think this it's warranted and hopefully since it's a continual recheck of an ongoing issue they won't charge you (my vet usually doesn't for rechecks.)
"My female and male cats get along and are healthy, but when male goes up to play with female, she hisses and growls","Let them work it out. ""I'm not in the mood to wrestle"" is a legitimate response. They'll figure out their own ways of interacting. (I presume they're both neutered, or there may be subtexts...)"
Kittens ate entire bag of treats! Please help,"Like a kid getting into the cookies, this isn't ideal but won't do much if any harm. In fact, some treats are nutritionally complete enough that a cat could live on them; they're just too expensive and not a well balanced meal. Read the labels. (I wish I'd realized that last when Harry was in palliative care for cancer. He was not eating well and losing weight, but was still interested in cat treats. I might have been able to give him another month or two if I'd just fed him those.)"
scab on cats head,"It is likely (albeit not definite) that it is caused by someones claws--could be her own or the other cat. It is even more likely if your cats are indoor only (if they go outside, obviously there are more ways she could get a scratch/scab like that). If it is in the same spot on both sides of her head, she could be trying to scratch her ears and is hurting herself. My cat sometimes has scratches/scabs in a similar area and the vet thinks her itchy ears are the way her allergies manifest. As long as it is healing, it's probably fine, but checking with the vet is always best. You could also make sure to keep both of their claws trimmed regularly so that these types of scratches are less likely to happen."
What flooring material is best for cleaning off cat pee?,"There's specific enzymatic sprays that react with, and remove the smell of pee, so in theory they're less likely to pee there. If there's pee smell, they will pee. Tiles are better since the pee won't soak into it, but most animals tend to pee in the same places so destroying the smell is important. The products you'd have depend on the market you're in, but the stuff we bought was labelled 'urine eliminator' and purchased at a pet store."
Acid reflux (GERD) in a dog with chronic kidney disease,It may not be GERD. Kidney disease is often accompanied by nausea. Ask your vet about proper diagnosis and treatment.
What is wrong with my dog’s butthole,"You should follow up with your veterinarian.
The black dots may be from soft dried stool, or from leaky anal glands.
If it anal glands, she should have them expressed and examined.
If it is soft stool, she should be evaluated for the cause.
If the area needs to be cleaned or is raw, best to let someone handle her who can do it safely, since she has already been snappy about it.
Please tell the Veterinary staff that she has been snappy about it."
Balcony time causing tension,"Assuming non-destructive approaches to attach netting are out of the question, here are some possible ideas to ease the tension. Make balcony breaks a dependable routine: Cats like routine and a clear schedule, having your smoke breaks always at the same times, and always the exact same number of breaks in a day will help the cat settle into a schedule, and reinforce the notion that balcony time is going to be available again later and doesn't need to be defended with claws. Take longer breaks: Since working from home sometimes comes with the benefit of more flexible hours, you could try taking longer breaks. Have a cup of your favorite beverage on the balcony after smoking, giving the cat a little extra time on the balcony while giving yourself some additional time to clear your head for work. Feeding time or jackpot treat after balcony breaks: Incorporate the balcony breaks into your feeding schedule, depending on your current feeding regimen you might feed smaller portions, but more frequently and always after a balcony break. Alternatively, offer a jackpot treat (something special that the cat is absolutely crazy about) after returning inside, and reserve this treat just for this occasion, reinforcing the notion that returning inside when asked is a good thing. Trade for something better: Outside time, even if it is just on a balcony, is a big deal for indoor cats. I would suggest trying to get the cat to accept a harness, and after the work day is done go for a short walk on a leash. This could help reduce the relative importance of balcony breaks in the mind of your cat, and help to ease the tension when it is time to leave the balcony because something even better is coming later."
"Algae will not go away!!!! And snails, too!",Clown loach fish is known for Snail control. Practically any loach should do. I have used them in past with great effect. Also I have always kept two bristlenose plecos to control algae in my 55 gallon freshwater tank. I have tried chinese algae eaters before but they are too territorial. Give these two fish a try. Natural way to control things instead of trying out equipment or manual labor.
Chronic illness meds and trust,"Unfortunately, handling pets is like handling kids. Sometimes you do have to do something they won't like, and they may be grumpy about it. Youngsters in particular may object because they don't have the experience to know this isn't seriously threatening. In the end, you just have to decide that ""I don't wanna"" is not an acceptable answer, give the cat the medical treatment they need, and trust that they'll forgive you. Which they will. They may continue to object to treatment, but they'll figure out that it's normal. Rewarding them afterward with a treat, or extra cuddling, may help with that process. Like giving a kid a lollypop after they've had an injection, it helps them decide to accept the annoyance."
Bovine colostrum for infant puppy,"I have no practical experience with feeding infant puppies, so please understand this as a theoretical answer. Colostrum is the first milk a mammalian mother (human or animal) produces for each baby. It contains all the proteins, minerals and antibodies of normal milk, but in higher concentrations. It provides the baby with the initial immunological defense after being born. But the mother's body usually only produces it for 2 - 5 days after birth and quickly switches to producing ""normal"" mother's milk after that time. So if your puppy is older than 5 days and had a chance to suckle milk from it's mother in those first days, it doesn't really require colostrum in it's diet. That's especially true if your puppy received a booster shot for the immune system from a vet. Since your puppy is still very young and colostrum also contains growth factors and nutrients in a very concentrated form, it will certainly be beneficial to feed some colostrum for as long as the puppy drinks milk, but it's not a requirement. And seeing that there are quality issues with colostrum, I would probably forgo it: From Wikipedia: There is also research suggesting that a large proportion of colostrum is not fit for human consumption ""due to tremendous bacterial loads"". Salmonella was also detected in 15% of unpasteurised samples.[51] Pasteurisation reduces the bioactive proteins many of the benefits rely upon, however. However, colostrum has some additional health benefits, especially for the digestive tract. So if your puppy is suffering from any infectious disease or diarrhea caused by bacteria or any other problem with the digestive tract, feeding colostrum can have some benefits even later in life. Colostrum itself is a laxative, so feeding too much can actually cause diarrhea, but it can help with constipation. Please be aware that the beneficial compounds in colostrum are destroyed if it's heated above 42°C. To sum it up: it's complicated. Colostrum does have beneficial effects for the immune system and gut health of newborn animals, but only if it's of good quality and not contaminated with bacteria itself. From Wikipedia: Bovine colostrum's components benefit the immune and digestive health of animals of all ages and species. Bovine colostrum's vast array of bioactive components collectively increase resistance to infection and disease caused by a wide range of pathogens including bacteria and viruses. The quality of the colostrum is essential in providing the essential benefits. Both contaminated early bovine colostrum at the farm level or late transition milk or milk are poor sources of the important colostral components necessary to maintain life and achieve and maintain healthy animal maturation and homoeostasis. Bovine colostrum also is beneficial in repairing or healing intestinal damage as well as increasing the absorption of nutrients from the GI tract. These properties and benefits are consistent among human and animal species."
Cat adjustment period when starting Zonisamide,"Just like with humans, medication side-effects with animals should be reported to a doctor (veterinarian) right away. You can additionally contact the medication's manufacturer. If your government has a regulating body to which you can report animal medication side-effects, you may want to report the side-effects to them as well. We wish Claude the best!"
"Rescued 7 pounder at puppy stage very receptive to people, now barks, growls and sometimes will bite","Despite being smaller, Mini Schnauzers have... really strong guard instincts. They are also very very vocal and excitable.  They're telling you there's a stranger there. As the former owner of a Schnauzer cross - you need to get people to ignore him when he barks, and reward appropriate interactions. If you're giving him treats when he's barky, he's associating the treat with the guard dog behavior. He did good! He gets treats! He even gets attention! They are smart dogs but environment matters a lot - and the behaviours you reinforce."
How much monthly costs can I expect if I get a kitten or two?,"As far as I know, breed is not a strong indicator of what to expect for cost when it comes to cats; their general health is a larger indicator, and something that can't always be determined as kittens. There are, of course, some good ways to estimate what you might pay to own one (or more) cats. I'll include some price estimates; because I am located in the US, these estimates will be in USD and based off the pricing on the online retailer Chewy. Pet Rent: This is the very first thing to check before you go any farther. Will your landlord allow you to have a pet? If yes, what (if anything) extra will you be charged? It's not uncommon to have an additional monthly fee as well as an additional deposit, commonly assessed per pet. In my home state, an article from 2019 cites an ""average pet deposit [of] $185 per animal, with an average monthly pet rent of $25 [each]."" Cats and small dogs will typically land on the lower end of pet rent scales, while larger dogs can go much higher. Adoption Fees: These will vary by area, rescue, and age of the cat. Kittens typically have higher adoption fees than senior (the next most commonly adopted range) or adult cats. Speaking from personal experience, my two older cats were $150 each, and the younger was $175 (though I paid $180, giving the extra to the rescue as a donation). These fees cover the cost of food and veterinary care prior to your adoption of the pet, and frequently do not cover the full cost. Veterinary Fees: Just like you need to see a doctor regularly, your cats will need to see a vet on a regular basis, both for vaccinations and for regular health assessments. You'll want to get them spayed or neutered, if they didn't come to you that way; these prices will again vary by area, as well as whether you use a standard, premium, or low cost clinic for the service. The amount you pay can flex as well based on whether the clinic you choose takes monthly payments or offers service packages; I personally use a service that costs around $35 per cat per month, but covers all office visits, vaccinations, and several other routine procedures. All of this is outside of any ""extra"" fees when a cat gets sick and needs additional treatment. Basic Supplies: There's a few things you'll have to have: an appropriate food bowl for each cat, at least one water bowl, at least one litterbox (recommendations are for one per cat plus one extra), a litter scoop and a good way to dispose of the litter. Prices on these can range; a basic melamine bowl from Chewy goes for about $2; ""whisker fatigue"" bowls (lower bowls that are more comfortable for cats to use) start around $3. As you start getting into fancier styles (elevated, ceramic or metal, etc.) the price can reach around $25 per bowl. A water bowl will start around the same, but many cats prefer fountains, which will range from around $20 for the most basic plastic styles, to $100 for fancier styles. Litter boxes, again, will range in price, with your most basic small litter pan on Chewy at around $5 (much too small for an adult cat) up to $100 for more elaborate standard pans, and even higher for automatic cleaning options. These can be considered ""semi-one time purchase"" options--you may need to try different bowls, litter boxes, or waste management systems before you find the one that suits both you and your cats. You'll still need to cover all of these up front, after which experience will start to guide you on what to replace with better options. Consumable supplies: Here's where your monthly costs will start to come in. Your cats will need food, litter, and treats (useful for enrichment, still to come). Kittens will need extra calories; my personal approach is to free-feed them with a kitten formula kibble, as well as scheduled feedings with wet food; I transition my cats to an all-wet diet as adults, as it tends to be better for weight management and urinary tract health. A basic bag of low-end kitten kibble is about $6 for three pounds; a good brand will start around $10 for a similar size. Wet food for kittens starts out around $7 for a case of six-3 oz cans (which is not a lot of food!), and again goes up from there. My adult cats get about 160-180 kCal/day, which with their current brand of food is about 4-5 oz of wet food per day. If you choose to get into freeze-dried or raw/fresh made options, the price can go up even farther; mine, personally, have rejected these types of diets. Litter, similarly, varies in price based on type and material; basic non-clumping litter is about $5 for a 7 lb bag, but you probably will want one that clumps for easier clean-up. A basic box of clumping litter starts around $10 for 14 lbs. Avoid scented options (other than ""cat attract"" type options), as the scents can be a turn-off to the cats and lead to litter box avoidance issues. And like everything else, treats can vary in price and quality. A basic bag of treats runs around $3, give or take; freeze dried options or ""premium"" ones will go higher. Enrichment: This is where people tend to let their cats down; many tales of cats who ""are miserable indoors"" or ""just won't behave"" are ultimately tales of cats who lack enrichment options. Proper enrichment isn't just a stuffed mouse or a ball with a bell in it--you need a range of options to cover multiple play styles and behavioral needs. Yes, do get the stuffed mouse and the ball with the bell in it; also get stuffed balls, pompons, crinkle balls, kicker toys, catnip plush, crinkle plush, real fur toys, coil/spring style toys, ""trapped ball"" toys (tracks and boxes), and other types in the self-directed play range. Your cats will decide what they like and don't like, and you can continue to purchase in the styles they gravitate toward. Thankfully, most of these toys can be found fairly inexpensively, often for $1 or so, though with very cheap ones you'll want to make sure they can't easily be pulled apart--and always remove damaged toys from play. Additionally, get some wand toys (a toy attached to a stick with a string) for interactive play--keep these put away when you aren't using them. Lasers can be a good option here too, though some controversy exists around whether they're enriching or frustrating to cats. Mine, personally, do enjoy them and don't find them frustrating; treats can be used to reduce the ""frustration"" as well by giving them a prize. Treat dispenser balls and puzzle toys can be good for directing energy and giving them a reward for their activities; treats can also be used for direct enrichment by tossing them to the cats to be chased or using them to teach simple tricks. Beyond toys, you also need furniture. Start with scratching surfaces--these aren't just ""scratching posts,"" but a variety of textures and orientations. Mine have choices of carpet, sisal (rope), and cardboard for materials, and flat, angled, and vertical for orientations, and they use all of them, each with their own preferences. Scratching surfaces will run you around $10 and up. You'll also want climbing surfaces, also called ""cat trees."" Cats naturally are inclined toward climbing, napping, and perching in elevated spaces; these also give them great locations to watch both interior and exterior (if placed near a window) spaces, and with multiple kittens, a great place to chase each other around. These typically include scratching surfaces, which can help cover those needs as well. A small cat tree typically will start around $40 and go up from there; test for stability when purchasing taller ones to be sure they won't be able to tip it over. Additionally, cats like hiding spaces; pop up cat tents, ""condos,"" and even plain cardboard boxes can be great for these options. I even have some inserts for Ikea's Kallax shelf that are designed for cats to tuck themselves into. Hiding spaces are the most budget-friendly option, as they start at free when you cut a door in a shipping box. Many cat trees also include condos as part of the design; a good cat tree can easily cover many enrichment needs. Miscellaneous: There are some additional things you'll want to consider beyond the categories above. Do you want collars for your cats? You'll want to be sure to get a good quality, breakaway collar--cats can become hung up on their collars, as they tend to sneak into narrow spots where they can become stuck, so a collar that pops off easily can be the difference between life and death for that cat. Prices here will start around $7. You should consider some enzymatic pet cleaner; accidents happen, and regular household cleaners aren't generally sufficient for cleaning pet messes. These will run around $5 and up. Do you want to leash-train the cats? You'll need harnesses and leashes for them, usually around $20/set. (Note: never leave a cat unattended in a harness!) To summarize, you're looking at an initial cost starting at a bare minimum of around $30/cat, assuming you have no pet deposit, and somehow get a ""free"" cat that's fully vetted already. This is extremely unlikely to happen, making the more likely initial minimum around $200/cat (again, assuming no pet deposit). Add to this a bare minimum monthly cost of around $25/cat for low-grade food and cheap litter, with no pet rent or vet costs factored in; this cost goes up with better quality food (which brings vet costs down in turn), and may shift depending on the calorie needs of the cats and how fast they go through food and litter as a result. None of these estimates include veterinary fees or any kind of veterinary coverage plan; with a coverage plan, you can assume another $20+/cat per month. Lastly, note that while many of these costs are less frequent than others (I haven't bought a litterbox in years!), by adopting a cat you are committing to these costs for 15-20 years."
How to properly lower PH while cycling a tank?,"Your alkaline pH implies tap water is very hard. Likely it is most practical to use mostly distilled , deionized water or rain water with very little tap water ( some minerals are needed). Adding anything such as an acid like vinegar is only a short term remedy."
