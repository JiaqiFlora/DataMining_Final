ipsec - What's the difference between IKE and ISAKMP?,"
ISAKMP is part of IKE. (IKE has ISAKMP, SKEME and OAKLEY). IKE establishs the shared security policy and authenticated keys. ISAKMP is the protocol that specifies the mechanics of the key exchange.
The confusion, (for me,) is that in the Cisco IOS ISAKMP/IKE are used to refer to the same thing. By which I mean, my understanding is that Cisco's IKE only implements/uses ISAKMP. So one configures IKE, and then conceptually inside that, one configures ISAKMP.

qos - Quality of Service based on Layer 7 traffic,"
I think this depends heavily on the platform on which you want to accomplish this. For example, IOS uses NBAR to classify transit traffic, primarily for QoS and security mechanisms. But as far as I know, NBAR QoS configurations are entirely static.
For centralized monitoring, NetFlow is probably your best bet.

That generally means the other side of the connection did not respond to any keepalives within the hold timer (default 180 seconds). There are a variety of issues that could have caused this. Usually its a layer3 reachability issue. If it happens again, you should rule out layer3 issue by testing to the peer via ping and telnet (telnet to port 179, see if it responds).
If its not a layer3 reachability issue, then there was a problem with one end of the neighborship (more likely the far side in this case).

security - Securing OSPF with only passive interfaces,"
One issue is that authentication ensures that only trusted devices are capable of exchanging routes on the network.  Without authentication, you could introduce a non-trusted device and cause significant routing issues.  For example:
If area 0 is not authenticated, attach a router in area 0 with bogus routes to null0.  You could even create a default route and inject it into the topology leading to the bad router to black hole traffic.  Or the route could force traffic toward a bogus gateway designed to sniff connections and pull out insecure data before sending it on the right path.
Authentication ensures that only routers you know about and trust are exchanging information.

The WS-G5484 is a multimode fiber connector.  If you're using standard multimode fiber (62.5 micron), you should be about to get around 300m distance out of them.  With 50 micron fiber, that number should go up to around 500m.

"How can I force VTP clients to update their VLAN database from the VTP server, on Cisco devices?","
You can't manually force updates because VTP configs are pushed based on the highest current VLAN database revision number.

Do not enable 'system-shutdown' option.

cisco - What is Dec MOP and how to disable it?,"
Decnet Maintenance Operation Protocol (MOP) is an ancient protocol that was used to administrate remote systems, and provided tools such as remote console or network bootstrap.  
However, as of now this is still enabled by default on all Cisco IOS Releases from 9.0 to recent 15.x. 
To disable MOP on the router it has to be done on a per-interface basis:
router# conf t

router(configure-if)# no mop enabled

router# sh run int f0/0 | include mop
 no mop enabled

MOP will be disabled even though the router still shows MOP as protocol on the interface:

UDLD in VSS configurations - Ntwork Enginring Stack Exchang,"
If you are referring the the VSL between the to VSS switches, I don't think it makes sense to enable UDLD because LMP will detect a unidirectional link.

LMP is designed to run on each VSL member link to maintain multiple state machines with the same peer over different ports. In a case in which a unidirectional condition on a port is detected, LMP marks it as down and attempts to restart VSLP negotiation—instead of err-disabling the port.

juniper - MPLS auto-bandwidth balancing,"
You certainly want to ECMP LSP's, how many to use depends on traffic levels relative to link bandwidths (critically you want to avoid LSP's being unsignalable due to being larger then a choke point).

"
Are CoS and QoS ever interchangeable?,"
QoS is an umbrella term which covers the use of features such as policing, shaping, traffic classification, and advanced queuing mechanisms.
CoS is a form of QoS limited to layer-2 Ethernet and it uses 3-bits (8 values) of the 802.1Q tag to differentiate your traffic. Therefore no trunking, no CoS.
DSCP is the most commonly acted upon value at layer-3 and it is found in 6-bits (64 values) of the IP header.  Typically only 14 of the values are used and are referred to using the notations of best effort, expedited forwarding (EF), and assured forwarding (AF).  AF values are in the form AFxy, where x is 1-4 and refers to the precedence and y is 1-3 and refers to the drop probability.
Telco vendors (such as AT&T specifically) use the term CoS to define the bandwidth allocation classes that they support in their MPLS offerings.  Basically they turned CoS into a marketing term.  Typically a Telco uses DSCP to know which of their CoS classes your traffic is supposed to be a part of.
Another important point for configuring these features is that in a Cisco switch or router you 
need to use a command such as 'mls qos trust dscp' or 'mls qos trust cos' or else the device will reset the QoS marking to zero.  There are some exceptions based on model, configuration, and IOS version but this has been true for everything within the last few years in my experience.  This configuration is required because the device needs to know which marking you want it to act upon since it cannot use both.  I like using DSCP. I haven't found a solid reason to use CoS over it but I'm sure someone has one.
"
Does it make sense to deploy OSPF across Metro Ethernet?,"
This is kind of a complex question, as the two different products are very different.  A MPLS L3VPN circuit inherently is a full mesh between all locations that participate, while a MetroE connection is generally a point to point link between two specific sites.  
In my experience, a MetroE circuit is a directly provisioned path, with no protect services, unless contracted with a protect path.  This means that failure of an interface or router along the specific path would be traffic interrupting between the two sites that are directly linked by the MetroE service.  The MPLS L3VPN will heal around interface/routing failures to keep you with a full mesh between your sites.  This generally accounts for the price difference between the two.
There is nothing wrong with building your own services on top of a MetroE platform -- you just need to work with customer requirements to determine what type of routing is appropriate.  If you are working with a small office network, OSPF/IS-IS/EIGRP could be a wonderful way to exchange routing information between the directly connected sites that you have established.  If you're more of an NSP/ISP/*SP, separating infrastructure and customer routes between IGP and EGP becomes much more important as you scale.
As an ISP engineer, we extensively use MetroE and EWAN links to build our backbone, and utilize our knowledge of the physical links to design our iBGP/eBGP environment.  In many cases, we use route reflectors, and dual route reflectors (route-reflector-client on both sides of the peering) to reduce our iBGP peer count.  However, unless you're dealing with 6+ routers in a POP, iBGP scales pretty well.
In short -- if it's for a single client, that is not offering network services to clients of their own -- stick with an IGP.  If external connectivity needs to be shared between sites, with failover/redundancy/etc, closely examine the physical paths you have, and design your eBGP/iBGP to reflect that.  No point in having a router in a remote location with only 1 link outside the site to iBGP peer with all other routers in the AS -- use a dual route reflector.

"
Should i run UDLD with spanning tree?,"
UDLD is generally run on fibre media, it is not required on UTP due to the use of Fast Link Pulse which is already monitoring link status.
This page has a very good explanation of the various L2 protections available. Here is an excerpt specifically regarding UDLD:

UDLD is used to detect if a link is only available in one direction,
  for example half the fibre is disconnected. UDLD performs this check
  faster than STP will bring the port in to a fowarding state. That
  means if you have UDLD and STP enabled then UDLD will prevent STP from
  bringing a port in to a state where it will forward traffic to
  nowhere.
A unidirectional link occurs when traffic is transmitted between
  neighbors in one direction only. Unidirectional Link Detection is a
  Layer 2 protocol. UDLD performs tasks that Layer 1  mechanisms, such
  as auto negotiation, cannot perform. When UDLD and auto-negotiation
  are enabled, both Layer 1 and Layer 2 detections work together to
  prevent physical and logical unidirectional connections and the
  malfunctioning of other protocols. Unidirectional links can cause 
  spanning-tree topology loops. UDLD enables devices to detect when a
  unidirectional link exists and also to shut down the affected
  interface. UDLD is useful on a fiber ports to prevent  network issues
  resulting in miswiring at the patch panel causing the link to be in
  up/up status but the BPDUs are lost.
With UDLD enabled, the switch periodically sends UDLD protocol packets
  to its neighbor and expects the packets to be echoed back before a
  predetermined timer expires. If the timer  expires, the switch
  determines the link to be unidirectional and shuts down the port. If
  messages are not received within the timeout interval (45 seconds),
  the port is disabled. The messages are sent out every default
  interval, which is 15 seconds.
The 45 seconds it takes to detect a unidirectional link and errdisable
  the port is less than the 50 seconds it would take for STP to
  transition the port to a Forwarding state, which is based on 20
  seconds for Max Age + 30 seconds for Listening and Learning. This
  prevents a loop that would otherwise be caused if STP transitioned the
  port into the Forwarding state because of a lack of received BPDUs.

So in summary, yes they can be run together and on fibre links they should be run together.

"
bgp - Better Enterprise Multihoming,"
Yes, you did hit the nail on the head.
You will get asymmetry in the improved design, but asymmetry is a fact of life on the Internet, and there's really no good reason to expect symmetric routing of traffic to/from.  Shoot, the whole concept of packet routing is that separate packets are routed independently of each other and may take different paths, even packets going in the same direction.
Personally, I loath PBR.  Its one of those technologies that when I decide that its the best solution to the problem, I stop and take a step back to see if I really understand the real nature of the problem, even back to figuring out what the business problem to be solved is.  When I do so, I almost always find that there is a way to solve the problem without using a technology like that.
Having full Internet routes in your routers will take some getting used to, but once you get used to it, it is indeed very easy to understand and troubleshoot.  Certainly there are fewer ""moving parts"" of different protocols to worry about.
You don't want to have full Internet routes in your OSPF database, so you'll want to advertise a default via OSPF into the interior of your network (or perhaps static default...personally I prefer default in OSPF).  That will move traffic towards the BGP speaking Internet routers which can make the more fully informed decision of having the full Internet routes.
That will give you close to ""destination based best path"".  There will still be cases where the traffic will do things you don't quite expect, so you'll want to get familiar with the BGP route selection process.

"VPN's in cloud hosting/dedicated server environments, IPSec tunnels vs tinc","
Not sure about tinc but IPSEC is almost mandatory. No serious business would trust PPTP. 
Not sure how IPSEC affects routing. A tunnel is a tunnel is a tunnel regardless of the encryption. You'll be running into the same issues re: split tunnel or not, getting customers to understand the concept / oh look a particular customer's LAN IP clashes with the VPN pool you've picked, etc.
Sounds like you're aiming at SME market (individual servers, direct login etc.) so that rules out more sophisticated solutions, but I'll list two possible approaches anyway

some kind of VPN concentrator that allows profiles. All customers login to VPN concentrator then depending on their profile/group/whatever vendor teminology, get permissions to use protocol X to IP Y (ie their own server). 
Cisco ASR1000V virtual routers - each customer gets one, you can then run direct IPSEC tunnels (with VTIs so makes routing appear easy)  or even direct MPLS back to the customers so the router appears as just another branch in their topology, then allocate your VNICs VLANs etc. on the inside so they get a nice virtual 'branch'. 
a smaller scale version of the above, we've used monowall to great effect for this purpose (i.e. each customer gets a layer 3 virtual device that acts as a router/firewall, they VPN into this device and get access to their VLANs only), however then each router/firewall needs their own public IP address. 

Re: your current approach, you do realise then each server needs a public IP or you have a complicated and convoluted system of NATs where each customer's VPN path gets allocated a single port or similar.
I'd recommend getting a full time networker in to look over any design / proposal you have, it sounds like you're coming at it from a server background.

What is the purpose of BGP TTL security?,"
BGP TTL security makes your router only accept packets that have a very high TTL number, typically 254. Since TTL is decremented every time a packet is routed, configuring this feature on both neighbors ensures that only a directly connected neighbor router could have sent you this packet.

cisco - Wireless Probe Request Forwarding Best Practices?,"
From my own experience, there are no caveats in disabling the filters.
To be honest, if there were an alarming amount of probe data coming from unknown/unassociated SSIDs, I'd be more concerned about the rogue SSIDs popping up in the vicinity of your WLAN, and the interference they would cause, as a posed to the increase in probe data.
It will definitely increase accuracy on location, but don't expect it to magically turn a low density location deployment into a <5 meter accurate one. (although, I don't know the physics behind this yet, or the actual gains from doing this) If you're particularly worried, just keep an eye on the bandwidth of the tunnels going back to the controller. (unless you have a 3850 already)
"
cisco - Mac-flap due to roaming clients on wireless,"
If your APs are just bridging clients from the wireless right onto your wired network, then you're going to see this from time to time. Clients will appear from different ports as they re-associate to other APs/cells in the ESSID.
I'm presuming you're talking about Cisco IOS here, based on the term ""MACFLAP"", which appears in their log messages when this happens.
For example: ""%SW_MATM-4-MACFLAP_NOTIF: Host 0011.2233.4455 in vlan 123 is flapping between port Gi1/1 and port Gi1/2""
What this means is that the switch is having to ""re-learn"" an Ethernet MAC address out of a different port than what is cached in the hardware forwarding table. This takes a little CPU time for each event, and having it happen more than couple times in a row will cause that MACFLAP message to get logged as more and more CPU time is consumed.
However, this should not cause the entire table to be flushed or cleared. Just the entries for the flapping source MAC address should be getting affected.
Now, in your case, if this is an infrequent message and it's just wireless clients moving from place to place, I wouldn't worry about this too much.
To prevent this, some centralized wireless client termination would be needed. This way, frames would pop out onto the wired VLAN in a consistent place.
However, if this is happening frequently for many MAC addresses, it could be indicative of a Layer 2 loop which will definitely need some investigation. :p
"
ethernet - When to choose fiber instead of twisted pair (copper),"
There are a fairly large number of factors to consider and it is also important to accept that not all fiber is the same just like not all twisted pair is the same.  Here are a few things that occur to me.  Of course these may vary depending on environment.
Fiber:  Much longer max distances, depending on specification and throughput.  No electromagnetic interference. Note however that fiber comes in a large number of grades and planning for the future may be somewhat more complex.
Copper: Shorter max distances per link.  Susceptible to electromagnetic interference.  Fewer number of grades/variations (but still mind these!) meaning fewer accidents when the rollout team grabs the wrong spool (see below for a funny story).  Supports power over ethernet.
Funny story:  A particular county in a Western state runs a fiber network that began as a control system for their hydroelectric dams.  As time went on they found they didn't need nearly as much fiber as was laid for this and so they separated out many of the strands and used it to build a county-wide network linking homes and businesses to ISP's and telco's.  Of course single mode fiber was used for longer transmissions and multi-mode for short runs.
So when they were running the longer runs to connect towns and cities with this new network, the team that ran the fiber grabbed the wrong spool, and ran multi-mode fiber on all these long distance links.  The team was quite unhappy when they found out they would have to re-run all the fiber again!  Moral of the story:  be very careful about ensuring that everyone knows which grades of fiber go where....
"
multicast - OSPF over vPC on Nexus7k,"
As the firewalls aren't part of a vPC they won't be part of the normal vPC loop prevention.
The loop prevention only states that a packet cannot ingress on the peer link if it is destined to go out another vPC enabled port.
Not too sure on the multicast front as we don't use it in our environment and I haven't really looked into its behaviour on the 7K's.
Usually if you are running a routing protocol down on the switch stack the recommended design would be to not have it as a member of a vPC and just use OSPF to give you the same advantages that vPC gives you at L2.
"
ethernet - How is the root bridge elected in STP?,"
Not sure how much you know about switching and spanning tree but basically when starting out all switches claim that they are the root. All switches send BPDUs (Bridge Protocol Data Unit) which contain a priority and the BID (Bridge ID). 
The BID is 8 bytes long. 6 bytes is used for the MAC address of the bridge. 12 bits is used to indicate the VLAN, this is called extended system ID. 4 bits are used to set the priority. Lower priority means it is preferred compared to a higher. The priority is set in multiples of 4096.
If there is a tie in priority then the lowest MAC address will determine which bridge becomes the root.
To select the path to the root the cost to the root is calculated. As the BPDU travels from the root downstream the cost is increased INBOUND. 802.1D-1998 (legacy STP) had a cost of 19 for a FastEthernet interface. The newer standard 802.1D-2004 defines a cost of 200000 for FastEthernet.
If there is a tie in cost then choose the BPDU that came from the switch with lowest BID. If that is a tie as well (multiple links to same switch) port ID comes into play. The port ID is from the upstream switch as well and consists of a port priority and port ID which identifies the interface. The default port priority is 128.
There is a lot to spanning tree but these are the basic steps.
"

The layout that we are using for our rollout is:

These sizes are mostly taken from the RIPE advisory here.
"
security - How do you prevent rogue wireless access points on a network?,"
Lucas's answer above is a bit of a starting point.    There are however two or three other things that must be considered.  These end up being somewhat outside the scope of network engineering, but certainly have impacts for network engineering and security so here they go.

You probably want some way of preventing wireless cards in company laptops from being switched into ad hoc mode.  Assuming the laptops are running Windows, you probably want to use a GPO to set to infrastructure mode only.  For Linux, it is harder to fully restrict, but there are ways to do this too.
Enforcing IPSec is also a good idea, particularly with good key management and trusted enforcement.  For example if you can go to X509 certs for key management this can keep unauthorized devices from communicating with the rest of your network directly.  Consider key management as a core part of the infrastructure here.  If you use a proxy server you may even be able to block unauthorized devices from accessing the internet.
Note the limitations of your efforts.  None of these prevents a person from setting up an unsecured wireless access point connected to a USB NIC, for sole purposes of communicating with their computer, especially if the SSID is hidden (i.e. not broadcast).

Not sure how to further contain problems or if further paranoia is well past the point of insufficient returns.....

ipv6 - Why is fe80::/10 reserved for link local addresses when fe80::/64 is actually used?,"
I think the link-local scope was set to /10 simply to ""fit in"" better with the other scopes, e.g. site-local (before it was replaced with unique local).

Can I use a Catalyst 2960-S for iSCSI?,"
Given that the Cat2960-S is a desktop/access switch, with very, very small buffers, you would likely experience a lot of output drops.  A datacenter switch, such as a 4948E, would be a better choice for an iSCSI application.  
To understand the reasoning behind this, you have to remember that an ethernet switch is either transmitting, or not transmitting on a specific port.  If traffic arrives on port 1 for port 2, and port 3 is already sending traffic to port 2, the traffic from port 1 has to be buffered until there's a gap in the traffic from 3 to 2.  If the buffer fills, additional traffic will be dropped.  The term ""microburst"" is used to reference traffic that, over time, is well below the limit for the interface, but occasionally bursts to cause output drops.
I am not as familiar with the 2960-S platform, but enabling QoS (without extensive tuning, see comments below) on it would probably be a bad idea; that would actually increase the number of output drops.  Enabling QoS splits your very small buffers into 4 even smaller buffers, and most traffic will hit only one of them.

"
cisco - Protocols: EIGRP vs OSPF,"
EIGRP is now an IETF draft so it's no longer proprietary. See https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-savage-eigrp-01
If we look at EIGRP with default settings and OSPF with default settings and there are multiple loop free paths to a destination then EIGRP will converge much faster because it keeps what are called feasible successors in it's topology database. These are basically loop free alternatives to the best path. EIGRP also has summarization at any point in the network. It also has stub feature which is useful when you don't want to use a router for transit. Commonly deployed in DMVPNS. EIGRP is also less confusing than OSPF because it does not have different network types and EIGRP is easier to deploy in hub and spoke scenarios.
EIGRP uses a flat network without areas, this can both be an advantage and disadvantage.
OSPF is obviously an open standard so it's the logical choice if you have multiple vendors. It can perform well but it requires that you tweak SPF timers because by default in IOS there is a 5 second wait before running the SPF algorithm. OSPF uses areas which means you can segment the network more logically. OSPF can only summarize between areas. OSPF is link state so it has a better view of the entire network than EIGRP before it runs the SPF algorithm. Network administrators will usually be more comfortable with OSPF because it's more commonly deployed.
Both protocols have advantages and disadvantages. But the common answer that EIGRP should be discarded because being proprietary is not entirely true any longer.

"cisco - Why does this router fail to use multiple, equal-cost routes from OSPF?","
My first thought would be that OSPF is thinking it's the same LSA instead of simply the same prefix. I don't know much about brocade, but with the LSA outputs from the Cisco box I could probably tell you more. 
In general, for Cisco, if the routes are equal in the protocol they will both be presented to the routing table. The routing table, will, by default, install both paths and do ECMP. If the metrics or protocols differ, they will not ECMP. This would also apply to different LSAs for the same prefix.

How is the payload distributed across Multilink PPP connections,"
Oi...lemme dredge up those long-unused neurons to remember how Multilink PPP works.
During the LCP phase when the first link is brought up during a non-multilink PPP session, the two sides negotiate the MRU (Maximum Receive Unit) for each direction of the link...basically each side tells the other how big of a packet it can handle being sent to it.
With Multilink PPP, they negotiate that, but they also negotiate, when the first link is brought up, an MRRU, or Maximum Reconstructed Receive Unit.
Because Multilink PPP added extra frame header space, the creators were concerned about Path MTU problems, so they decided that Multilink would be able to fragment and reassemble packets on either end of the Multilink PPP session.
So, yes, unlike Ethernet bonding, its not just a matter of balancing frames across the multiple links...the frames can actually be fragmented and reassembled.  This can cause a jump in latency and jitter.
On T-1's you should be able to configure each side with a significantly larger MRU and MRRU than any packets that would likely need to cross the link, and if the MRU is as large as, or larger than the MRRU, then you shouldn't see any fragmentation and reassembly occuring.  Hopefully this will get the latency and jitter under control and help out your VoIP behavior.  You will likely need to adjust this configuration on both sides of the links, though, as each direction is negotiated independently.
In general, I wouldn't expect VoIP packets to need to be fragmented, though...they tend to not be big enough to need that.  Worth a shot to check your MRU and MRRU sizes on the links and the Multilink session, maybe they're way out of whack and causing problems.

How can I verify QoS DSCP marking on a Cisco Catalyst 4500E?,"
Try this:
show platform hardware interface ten1/1/31 statistics
That should show you input bytes by CoS.
The 4500 is a very different beast than the 3560/3750 for qos config and monitoring.  Some other useful verification commands are:
show platform hardware qos interface foo X/Y
shows queue lengths and flow counts
show interface foo X/Y counter detail
shows interface egress packets by queue, queue drops and DBL drops.
show policy-map interface foo X/Y
Mostly useful if you are doing custom policy maps 
show interface foo X/Y capabilities
If you want to know what the number and type of queues are available on a particular interface
show qos maps
To show the DSCP-CoS mappings

bgp - Only One Path in the Looking Glass,"
BGP always only advertises the best path onward to its peers.  This is true for eBGP, iBGP, route reflection (which is merely a special case of iBGP), and any other way you might use BGP.
But, yes, you are correct, if you are sending advertisements to providers A and B, and I have connections and BGP sessions also with providers A and B, then I should see both paths in my BGP tables.  I may not see multiple routes created in my routing tables...that's a question of the configuration of my devices and whether I allow multiple routes of equal AS Path lengths to be inserted into the routing table...typically BGP will only install a single route.  The BGP tables, though, should show advertisements from both providers.
Actually...even if I'm peering with providers B and C, or even C and D, I should still see multiple paths in my BGP tables as long as you are reachable through B, C, and D.  All other things being equal, my devices should pick B because that should be the shortest AS PATH, but I would still see the paths with the longer AS PATHs from C and D.  Now, perhaps C and D have both decided that the path through A is better than the path through B, then the paths that I would see would have AS PATHs of ""A C"" and ""A D"", so it would appear as if you weren't connected to B at all, but if the path through A went away, then the path through B would get propagated onward through C and D.
If you can give some specifics...maybe even your blocks that you're advertising if you're willing to share that....others can take a look at what we're seeing and perhaps give some more specific guidance.

cos - QoS on HP Procurve 2520 and 3800 switches,"
If my memory serves, the older Procurve switches used to accept and forward any CoS/DSCP markings they received.  You couldn't modify them unless you were on a 5400xl or better switch.
It looks like the 2520 and the 3800 allow you to modify whether or not you're using CoS or DiffServ TOS for classification.  The top level command you want is qos type-of-service.  The rest of the commands should be contained under that.  If they aren't available, you may not be able to modify the QoS settings on that specific platform.

ethernet - How sensitive is TDMoE to BER?,"
Take a look at https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4553, generally speaking while the transport should provide error information, you'll loose information, there's no way to retransmit something that was sent. The transport itself (CEoIP in Cisco speak, or more generally - L2VPN with TDM transport over it) will be fine as long signalization will work between end nodes, your application however, running it's data over the TDM may encounter errors.
That's why it's critical for the nodes to be able to properly time the transport. If you'll be providing the transport yourself this is also different discussion that if you're asking for transport - for typical ME service, you'll get typical Ethernet BER assurance.

If you give us some more specifics we could help with providing a policy for you.
"
In a multi-tenant environment what should be done to make your switchports silent on Cisco and Juniper switches?,"
You can check the Amsterdam Internet Exchange's Config Guide for hints on how to silence switches from a variety of vendors.
In my experience there are vendors whose software is so bad that their equipment is never silent, for example they ARP out every interface when they boot, or send out some upon a link up event on a port. Juniper, Cisco, Brocade can be muffled with varying degrees of persuasion, Extreme loops everything during EAPS transitions.
Some things to disable/consider:

Discovery protocols (LLDP, CDP, FDP, 'dynamic-vlan-discovery')
VTP, DTP
STP (disable for the VLAN a port is in)
Ethernet keepalives or loop frames (useless on full-duplex media)
Weird stuff like DECnet MOP (topic of another question a few days ago)
Have a separate management VLAN for the switch's own IP address
You'll want to disable PIM snooping on a Cisco as this breaks IPv6.

"
juniper ex - Migrating from VLANs to MPLS on JunOS,"
This looks like a simple layer two domain. MPLS is typically used only as backbone or distribution transit, that is, among routers. To implement MPLS, you would need to push the VLAN interfaces down to the access switches (and thus split Host5 into a new network or move it to switch 2) and run MPLS among the multilayer switches. Although, this wouldn't bring much benefit to the topology shown.
"
juniper mx - Sub-interfaces vs. Interfaces,"
If you mean using a switch to break out your 10g router port into individual VLANs and then using subinterfaces to route each port individually, I don't see how that is really wrong. Yes you'll lose the immediate failover when the physical port goes down, but as they say that's the ""cost of doing business"". Router ports are expensive compared to switch ports so I assume that is a business decision.

cisco nexus 1000v - Extending MPLS in to vSwitches,"
At this moment you cannot terminate MPLS VPNs on vSwith/Nexus1000V, so the best options are vlans. Somewhere on PE you must have interfaces in separated VRFs. VRFs will be mapped to VLANs on PE. Use trunks to connect to N1k.
With VPLS idea is the same, but you can move virtual machines between PEs.
There is one great article about implementation of MPLS VPN in enterprise (practice) done by Himawan Narugho (without vSwithes, but the idea is the same). http://www.himawan.nu/2006/06/enterprise-mpls-vpn-howto.html

How can I generate traffic on a Cisco ASA?,"
(Just noticed your comment about Raspberrys, and I want to follow up)
We have a large MPLS network where we need to measure bandwith and jitter across sites to make sure that our most sensitive applications isn't hurting.
One great way of doing this is, like you mentioned, deploying Raspberrys. They are small enough, so you can install them nearly anywhere. One great toolf for testing bandwith/jitter is iperf, which you then can set up to run as a (filtered!) daemon on each PI. Then just initiate tests from a central management station.
"
What causes total output drops on a cisco switch interface?,"
Unless someone is clearing counters you should never see any odometer-type counters (those that increment based on a packet action) decrease, they should always increase.  That part sounds like a bug.
As far as what causes output drops in particular, there are so many different causes that it's very difficult to pinpoint it exactly.  Sometimes there is congestion inside the switch's backplane and those might show up as output drops on the outgoing interface.  In rare circumstances you can also get microbursts that don't show up when polled at 1 minute intervals that quickly overload the interface, but then drop back down very quickly.  I would suggest grabbing the SNMP OID for output drops and then graphing that and see how it corresponds to the CLI counter.
Generally speaking, you don't want any output drops as they indicate a packet that did not make it to its destination.  But, if you're running your links hot (which you say you're not) they're unavoidable to an extent, mostly due to interior switch buffering, etc.

cisco - Routing with seperate WAN link for backups,"
Assuming the two NICs on the servers are used to separate production and backup traffic, use VRFs. That's the best traffic separation technique there is. For more scalability (not sure you need it based on the diagram), throw full-blown MPLS/VPN in the mix, it runs on both Cat 6500 and ASRs.
"
ber - Emulate Ethernet frame loss for testing purposes,"
There are tools like WANem which allow you to simulate WAN links by artificially causing arbitrary delay and loss rates on a link. WANem works at a relatively high-level; you won't see physical errors on the link but packets will be dropped. It can be deployed on commodity hardware.
I know there are a few other tools which serve similar purposes but I can't recall the names of any at the moment.

cisco - What are the alternatives to OTV for stretching a layer 2 network across 2 datacenters?,"
VPLS, AToM, and L2TP are also additional ways to glue ports together that land on distant routers.  Some of them require MPLS on all the in-between routers, but L2TP(v3 in particular) does not require anything besides ip routing on the intermediary routers.  Basically, they glue together two remote router ports, and can usually pass spanning tree, etc, since they're not acting as switches in this regard.

Taking a shot in the dark here because there are a lot of variables you didn't mention.  Please update the question to include the specific technologies you are using, your currnet config, and the error you are getting.  But if you are using for instance, DMVPN + EZVPN, you will probably have to use keyrings and multiple ISAKMP profiles.  Since you point to phase 1 issues I would check that.  The following links give reference configs for DMVPN and EZVPN and L2L+EZVPN. You should be able to modify to suit your needs.

How to log out of state sessions on Juniper SRX platform?,"
Packets should be classified regardless of the TCP handshake being watched or not. If there isn't a session defined for that flow (fast path) a new one should be created (first path).
Do you have any screen configured?? Maybe it's the screen that's dropping the traffic.
More details on Troubleshooting Traffic Flows and Session Establishment
Maybe you can configure a log file with traceoptions:
security {
  flow {
        traceoptions {
            file trace_file;
            flag basic-datapath;
            packet-filter Match {
                protocol tcp;
                source-prefix <source-ip>;
                destination-prefix <dest-ip>;
                destination-port <tcp-port>;
            }
        }
    }
}

Beware of these traces, since it can cause high CPU load on the SRX if it's carrying a lot of traffic. Limit the filter as much as possible and run it during a maintenance window.
"
ecmp - Two Cisco ASA 5525-X as Internet Gateways without Layer 2,"
I think you have two options:

Designate one Internet circuit as the primary and the other as failover
Implement ""NAT outside"" (public space) routing between the sites with the firewalls

The first option ensures traffic is always going through either one firewall or the other so that NAT doesn't break.
The second option allows you to load balance across both circuits: One equal-cost default route from each circuit, with your local public prefix(es) advertised out both circuits. (This option ignores how connectivity between the sites is accomplished.)
"
"Is TCP maximum segment size (MSS) ""clamping"" compatible with IPv6?","
Well technically fragmentation can happen in IPv6; This is the wikipedia article on it.
This Juniper page is a bit old but it shows that you can clamp an MSS for TCP over IPv6 on Junos the same as you would in IPv4 using the same command, tcp mss. The same is shown in this article for Cisco IOS 15, using the traditional ip tcp adjust-mss command.
So you can configure MSS clamping if PMTUD isn't working as it should be in a part of your network, otherwise, you should be ensuring that you are aiding the smoothing running of PTMUD across your networking so that MSS clamping isn't required (I understand this isn't always under your control).

My knee jerk reaction to this would be to say ""don't do it."" Mainly because these switches would not support data center bridging. FCoE is not like iSCSI. FC is a bus and assumes it is lossless. Ethernet, as you know, is lossy. DCB allows Ethernet to act lossless and transport FCoE frames.

RPKI is two-way action. First of all, it would be nice if you could sign your own prefixes, so nobody will be able to hijack them somewhere in the other part of the internet (if his upstreams support and validate prefix advertisements using RPKI). The more end-sites will use RPKI, the better value will have using RPKI to various SPs and more SPs will do it.
On the SP side, it would be beneficial to push your upstreams to implement RPKI at the same time. 
"
Migration from IPv4 to IPv6 strategies,"
I don't have a full strategy, but here's the rough way I did it at $JOB[-1]:

Get an IPv6 block, either from your existing carrier, or an RIR
You might also want to mark a fc00::/7 (Unique local) block for fully internal subnets if you have an ISP block and may ever need to renumber
Decide on your v6 IGP, IS-IS is still a safer option than OSPFv3, but much kit won't do IS-IS
Bring up v6 on your core kit, from internet edge through to DC core switches
Bring up v6 transit, if you have to a BGP tunnel from he.net can work while waiting for ISP's stuck in the last decade (remember to enable v6 on your iBGP mesh if you have one)
Create v6 infrastructure services, mostly DNS, v4 accessible is fine here
Enable v6 on a single server net (you'd probably have a default deny firewall here)
Test the v6 connectivity to the world, will it break things?
Turn up v6 on a second server net for redundency
Bring up a DHCPv6 server if you want to use it
Bring up v6 on a single access network (IT staff is a good choice here)
Test. Ensure nothing breaks
Bring up v6 on remaining server networks
Add a v6 namesever for your domains, and a v6 DNS entry for an MX (one, or all but one are good choices for what to dual-stack)

Now, when bringing up new services or upgrading them you can test if they work on v6, and add the appropriate DNS records (almost all web services will ""just work""), eventually you might start looking for services remaining on v4 and fix them, but there's no hurry for that.

"
cisco - Mitigating bad/malicious IPv6 RA announcements,"
This is from the configuration guide for IOS 15.2T. The feature is called RA guard. Basically you create a policy and define if the port that this will applied to leads to a host or to a router. Then you can be more specific and match on hop limit, managed-config-flag and match on an ACL with a range where the trusted sources should come from. You can also make the port trusted and not do any further checks.
In some ways this is very similar to DHCP snooping. The basic steps are:
ipv6 nd raguard policy RA-PROTECT
device-role host
interface x/x
ipv6 nd raguard attach-policy RA-PROTECT

Then you can use this command to verify:
show ipv6 nd raguard policy

If your switches supports the feature then it makes sense to catch the RAs as early as possible. I don't think it's being to paranoid. The same could be said for DHCP. Sometimes it's not even malicious users, it's just a case of people not knowing better or connecting crappy devices to the network.

"best practices - Selecting IPv6 Unique Local Addresses (ie, choosing least-sig 40 bits)","
Its always best to stick to the relevant RFC when possible. In this case, your two options aren't mutually exclusive. SIXXS' generator should actually generate you a prefix based on RFC4193's algorithm.

Is GRE necessary for an IP-only tunnel?,"
Either method will work. I personally prefer GRE, but there should be no practical difference between the two for your use case. (GRE can transport other layer3 protocols than just IP, though.)

"
Prevent Trombone Routing with L2 DCI,"
You are correct there is something called FHRP isolation, where you block the messages of your FHRP between the Datacenter and in turn create a Dual active gateway's, one in each DC. The nodes in each DC can egress L3 in it's own DC.
From my point of view and experience, I recommend everyone doing this to try to minimize the tromboning of traffic between sites. Makes sense that traffic f.ex between vlan in one DC don´t need to traverse to another DC to egress it's L3.
Now in Cisco world you see this FHRP isolation accompanied with OTV (basically a way to send L2 across L3 without expanding the broadcast domain). I have seen some documentation on doing this with Port ACL's, mac acl on other platforms but can´t find it any more.

architecture - OSPF link cost design,"
Not sure this is a question that can get a really good answer but it's important to know the preference order of OSPF:
intra area routes
inter area routes
external type 1
external type 2
NSSA type 1
NSSA type 2

So in some cases adjusting the metric has no effect on traffic engineering. It's important to change the auto-cost reference-bandwidth on Cisco devices so that there is a difference in cost between higher speed interfaces. By default this might be set to 100 Mbit. This would mean that 100 Mbit, gig and 10 gig interfaces would have the same cost.
For faster convergence it's good to have equal cost routes (ECMP) so if you are peering iBGP to a loopback you two paths and if one goes down the impact should not be that big.
I used to work for a large ISP and they set all the costs manually on the transit interfaces. The basic design was to choose the path that had the fewest core hops. The network was designed with access, distribution and core levels with dual links between each level. If there are multiple paths with same number of core hops then choose the path with the lowest delay.
So based on this they designed the paths and set costs on the interfaces. This might require a lot of planning. The bad thing about link state protocols is that they only use the bandwidth of the interface to calculate the metric. So you could have a case where the metric is the same but the distance is significantly longer via one of the paths.
We are talking quite large networks before this would have an impact though.
So I would design it based on bandwidth, number of devices to go through, physical distance (delay) and of course money could be a factor if one path is more expensive than the other.
"
powerconnect - Changing the Stacking Configuration on four Dell M6220 blade switches,"
This can be done, see the page 15 of the Dell white paper on the subject here:
http://www.dell.com/downloads/global/products/pwcnt/en/pwcnt_stacking_switches.pdf
Specifically it says:

Merging Two Operational Stacks
The recommended procedure for merging two operational stacks is as
  follows:

Always power off all units in one stack before connecting to another stack.
Add the units as a group by unplugging one stacking cable in the operational stack and physically connecting all unpowered units.
Completely cable the stacking connections, making sure the redundant link is also in place.

Two operational stacks can also be merged by reconnecting stack cables
  without powering down units in either stack. Connecting a powered up
  standalone unit to an existing stack leads to same behavior as when
  merging two operational stacks. In such cases, Manager reelection is
  done and the Manager with the higher MAC address wins the election.
  The losing stack manager resets itself and all its member units. After
  the reset, all the losing stack members join the winning stack to form
  a single stack. The winning stack remains functional through the merge
  process. If the stack merge is performed in this way, then it is
  strongly recommended that the user set the admin management preference
  of the desired winner stack manager to a higher value than the stack
  manager that should lose the election.

Also, in your above proposed cabling you are not completing a loop with your stacking cables. You should always aim to do this, even though it is not a requirement. See page 7 of the Dell m6220 stacking use case:
http://i.dell.com/sites/content/business/solutions/whitepapers/zh/Documents/powerconnect-m6220-switch_cn.pdf

Cabling: 
M6220 switches should be stacked together by connecting a
  stacking cable from stack port xg2 of one switch to stack port xg1 of
  the next sw itch. The stacking cable is included with the stacking
  module. Stack port xg2 of the fi nal switch in the stack should be
  connected to stack port xg1 of the first switch, completing the stack
  loop. A loop topology is not strictly required for a stack but it is
  recommended, as it is the most robust stacking topology and has seen
  the most time in production use.

wireless - configuring IBSS WLANs,"
On Linux for all cards that support it (used to be all, many these days don't) you simply run:

You can do WEP, and apparently even TKIP-based WPA.
Once configured you can treat it like a classic ethernet bus (Think Coax or 10baseT hubs), with one big caveat, the ""hidden node problem"", in ad-hoc there's no repeaters so if two nodes can't make direct radio contact with each other they can't talk (at that layer, you can of course bridge or route at a higher level).

So there is at the moment ZERO inter-vendor interoperability.

Cisco GET VPN Configuration - Best Practices/Can the loopback be used?,"
If you are planning to implement multiple links in the same GDOI group on the GMs, best practice would be to use a loopback interface as the crypto source.

wireless - what to know about DSSS vs OFDM,"
From what I've gathered, the primary differentiation between DSSS and OFDM comes in a congested or constrained RF environment.  Because DSSS is transmitting as many bits as possible all at once, it runs the risk of having some of the transmission disrupted in transit should the RF become less than ideal.  In contrast, OFDM sacrifices a bit of performance to transmit the data in those multiple carrier ""packets"" that allow for reassembly or retransmission in the event of a failure.
If I use an extra-large semi truck to haul freight, it works well so long as the highway doesn't have any obstructions (like narrow lanes or short overpasses).  If I break my freight up into a greater number of smaller trucks, I can ensure that some of the freight arrives even if conditions (like a traffic jam) prevent the entire shipment from arriving.
"
Does RIP to BGP redistribution for an MPLS VPN make sense?,"
I don't guess there's any real reason it can't work just fine.  You, of course, have the normal loss of information anytime you redistribute from one protocol into another, but there's an argument to be made that you get that when you use network statements as well, so that's kind of a wash.
The main benefit that I see in this is that redistribution would give the setup the ability to react more dynamically to what happens in their network than the more static network statements.  The downside would be that that dynamicism (is that a word?) would be harder to keep in control and might end up doing things that you don't want it to do.  Of course you can put filters and route-maps and the like to constrain the redistribution...but then that's kinda like putting the network statements in.
Not that I would advocate being deceptive in what you're delivering to a customer, but if its fully managed CEs...would they even know the difference?
Assuming you're only talking about a handful of /24's like your diagram would suggest, I just don't think it makes all that much difference one way or the other.  If you set up the redistribution to only allow the /24s, or set up network statements to advertise /24s...ultimately it ends up pretty much the say, right?
What may be the even bigger question that I would have (tongue-in-cheek), is...who uses RIPv2 in this day and age?!
"
architecture - Distributed L3 Switching,"
A lot of the content in this question is very Cisco-ish, let's dial that back and dispel some mythical assumptions.
1. I need to do Layer 2 at the core
Not unless that's all your hardware is capable of; you could quite freely have point-to-point (links/portchannels) between everything in your core and bring up OSPF/ISIS adjacencies, this is arguably superior to a large L2 domain at the core since you're now precluded from inflicting L2 loop prevention upon yourself; topology changes are now going to be handled by your IGP. If you need to multipath, ECMP takes the place of things like GLBP.
2. Traditional DC architecture centralizes routing
Depends what you mean by ""Tradition"" - IPv4 is ""traditionally"" classful, modern IPv4 is not. In the same vein, a modern datacenter architecture will make the vast majority of non-access links between equipment pass traffic over L3, because from a security and performance standpoint, you want to mimimize the size of your broadcast domains and avoid reliance on L2 loop prevention which tends to impact traffic flow for significantly longer periods than an L3 protocol when a topology change happens (recent development such as SPB and TRILL not withstanding)
3. Traffic between broadcast/multipoint domains must happen at the Core
Again, this is down to the hardware you have; if your distribution layer is capable of L3 forwarding on par with your core and also happens to be the termination point for the particular domains you wish to route traffic between, there's no logical reason to send that traffic up to the core only to have it sent back down.
So, with all this in mind, why do large, flat L2 networks remain so pervasive? Because it's ""simple"" and doesn't require too much thought. Setting up multi-area OSPF and ensuring optimum paths throughout the network by configuring link costs appropriately makes for an excellent architecture, but it requires you to think. spinning up a few VLANs, using something like GLBP and letting spanning tree just ""do its thing"" does not. The real WTF however is that a decent L2 setup should have a well-thought out STP configuration just as OSPF should.

Your example, doesn't make much sense, beause that is exactly what is done with all antennas.  You have a power source (the transmitter) on one end.  The signal is radiated based on the shape of the antenna and any characteristics of the antenna to focus the signal.
As to why a dipole emits an ""odd spherical-like shape"" (often referenced as a toroid or doughnut), that is a relatively simple concept.  A dipole antenna is often just a straight piece of wire.  The amount of surface area available directly relates to how much signal is transmitted in any direction.  You have a much larger surface area around the lenght of the wire than you do at the tip or base, allowing much more signal to be radiated from the sides.

wireless - Full-duplex with two antennas,"
A while back I read several articles about researchers using signal inversion cancellation to achieve full-duplex wireless. With a quick google search I found the below links to similar articles to the ones I read back when.
TLDR;
It's for sure possible...though I think they're using signal inversion cancellation instead of two channels (I.E. two different frequencies). People are working on it. Only a matter of time.

I'd love to get a true RF engineers thoughts on this though. I'm by no means an RF guy.

screenos - Is it possible to block IKE from reaching a Netscreen's control plane?,"
That should be caught by the default dos-protection-group. No? Do you have, perhaps, 'unset ike dos-protection' ?
What does 'show suspicious-control-flow-detection ike' show?
"
routing - Distributing static routes across an OSPF area,"
What does the topology look like? How are you doing routing today towards these networks? Or is the router being deployed now? Do you have an OSPF capable router connected to this router that is not running OSPF?
If you do then I suggest you redistribute static on this router. Something like:
ip prefix-list static-routes permit 10.0.0.0/24
ip prefix-list static-routes permit 10.0.10.0/24
ip prefix-list static-routes permit 10.0.20.0/24
route-map static-allowed permit 10
match ip address prefix-list static-routes
route-map static-allowed deny 20

The explicit deny at the end is not really needed as there is an implicit deny but it makes the logic a bit more clear.
Then under the OSPF process:
router ospf x
redistribute static subnets route-map static-allowed

spanning tree - Migrating from STP short mode to long mode?,"

I would run the change from root outwards but I don't think there are any use cases for doing it each way (someone correct me if I'm wrong).
Manual costs will stay exactly the same so you should at some point convert these to fall in line with your new costs once you have changed over.
Be aware of the fact that during topology changes or before you change over the manual metrics you may be running a sub-optimal L2 path between nodes.
It is recommended that all your switches run the same cost type and reference bandwidth, although I can't see any fatal flaws in not having them all the same it again could give you an inconsistent / sub-optimal L2 path.

End-to-End FCoE - Ntwork Enginring Stack Exchang,"
I think it's mature enough for production use. However, it's not an all-or-nothing thing. Right now the only major FCoE (multi-hop) vendor is Cisco. They're pitching a Fibre Channel fabric where it doesn't matter if the ports are FC or FCoE. Some ports might be 8 Gbit FC, others might be 10 Gbit Ethernet running FCoE. 
You can have an FC-connected storage array, connected to a Nexus 5K, using a Nexus 7K as your core (or MDS with FCoE cards), aggregating down to another 5K, to a UCS B-Series connected via FCoE. 
Brocade is a native FC shop, and they've been pushing 16 Gbit FC for I think 2 years. Cisco just announced a 16 Gbit FC switch, so they're a little later to the 16 Gbit game, though they've been pushing 10 Gbit Ethernet FCoE for about as long. 
Also, 10 Gbit Ethernet is about 1250 MBytes of raw throughput, where 16 Gbit FC is 1600 Mbyte/s of raw throughput, because of the way FC was designed.

switch - How can I diagnose a bridging (ethernet) loop?,"
OK, so assume you have a topology like:
          SW1
         /   \
        /     \
       /       \
PC A--SW2-----SW3--PC B

For some reason there is a bridging loop, STP is disabled or someone applied a filter in the wrong place or such.
PC A wants to communicate with PC B. It first ARPs for the MAC of PC B, the destination is a broadcast with MAC ffff.ffff.ffff. So the frame goes to both SW1 and SW3. The SRC MAC is PC A. SW1 then floods the frame towards SW3 and SW3 will flood the frame coming from SW2 to SW1.
SW1 and SW3 learned the MAC of PC A when the first frame came in. When the second one comes in from the opposite direction it has to relearn it. Because these events occur so fast and repeatedly you will see log messages complaining about MAC flapping. Something like ""MAC FLAP 0000.0000.0001 is flapping between Gi0/24 and Gi0/23"". This is a good sign that you have a loop.
What you could do then is to try to trace this MAC. Try looking in the ARP cache of a device in the same subnet and see what IP this device has. So with the MAC you could try to trace it with sh mac-address-table or with the IP maybe you have a list with all IPs and where they are connected.
If the host gets a IP address from a DHCP server you could also try there to find where the host is coming from. If you have option 82 enabled that would be a great help.
Other signs are that the CLI will be very sluggish. CPU load will be very high. Switches do almost everything in ASICs so if a switch has a CPU load over 50% it's probably not good. You should implement SNMP monitoring and watch for high CPU load. Also look for the MAC flap messages. If the switches have a loop the LEDs will probably be blinking like crazy.
Things you could do to protect against loops:

Enable STP! (duh)
SNMP monitoring of CPU load
Enable SNMP traps for certain events like STP topology changes
Enable storm control on the ports to limit broadcast
Don't span your VLANs too much in your L2 topology
Enable port security and limit number of MAC addresses per port
Enable Option82 if you run DHCP

"
cisco - catalyst 3750x - jumbo frames on svi,"
From the configuration guide:

Frames sizes that can be received by the switch CPU are limited to 1998 bytes, no matter what value was entered with the system mtu or system mtu jumbo commands. Although frames that are forwarded or routed are typically not received by the CPU, in some cases packets are sent to the CPU, such as traffic sent to control traffic, SNMP, Telnet, or routing protocols.

But if it's received over a trunk it shouldn't be routed in the first place and even if it was the jumbo MTU should still apply.

Routed packets are subjected to MTU checks on the output ports. The MTU value used for routed ports is derived from the applied system mtu value (not the system mtu jumbo value). That is, the routed MTU is never greater than the system MTU for any VLAN. The routing protocols use the system MTU value when negotiating adjacencies and the MTU of the link. For example, the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol uses this MTU value before setting up an adjacency with a peer router. To view the MTU value for routed packets for a specific VLAN, use the show platform port-asic mvid privileged EXEC command.

Can you try this command:
show platform port-asic mvid

So it seems 1998 is max on SVI.

"
packet analysis - Why do network taps have four ports?,"
Hardware network taps provide one output port in each direction to ensure that traffic can be replicated at line rate. For example, a 100 Mbps Ethernet connection provides a theoretical maximum of 200 Mbps of total bandwidth; 100 Mbps in each way. If you tried to capture traffic from a line which was carrying 75 Mbps in each direction, you would need at least 150 Mbps of one-way bandwidth: more than a single 100 Mbps connection can carry. Hence, taps include two output ports operating at the same speed as the line being monitored.

juniper - How to force VPLS/L2VPN to use a specific path,"
Short answer, just use Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP).
Long answer, you could use multi-topology-routing and have multiple metrics in each interface and force some packets to different topology than another packets. But I would not really venture there.
You might want to talk to your account team that you want segment routing implemented: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-previdi-filsfils-isis-segment-routing-02 (customer pressure will help resource development)
Segment routing would make it trivial to solve your problem while removing both LDP and RSVP from your network, relying only on IGP.

As my suggestion in comments did not actually work, I'll explain why not, and how to fix.
Problem is we need to have LSP installed in HW to be able to use it. And by my suggestion the RSVP LSP is not actually installed until LDP LSP goes away. So we cannot conditionally inject traffic there.
I couldn't find any way to force RSVP+LDP in ECMP, with equal preference LDP wins. But we still can achieve what is desired at least in two separate ways.

Dual next-hops
Add second next-hop in the l2circuit PEs. This next-hop will not be used by iBGP, so it draws no traffic at all.
Now configure RSVP tunnel for this second loopback and use it as neighbor address for l2circuit.
Net effect is, all traffic is using LDP except this l2circuit which is using RSVP
RSVP only
Create two RSVP tunnels, one using IGP path (i.e. will use same as LDP) another using your explicit path. These can be set to ECMP, i.e. all traffic will use both tunnels.
Now as we've accomplished ECMP requirement, we can use 'routing-options forwarding-table' export policy to put some traffic on LSP_NORMAL and some traffic on LSP_EVPN. Essentially our export policy would be:

.
term EVPN {
    from community EVPN;
    then {
        install-nexthop lsp LSP_EVPN;
        accept;
    }
}
term NORMAL {
    from next-hop 1.2.3.4;
    then {
        install-nexthop lsp LSP_NORMAL;
        accept;
    }
}

Now none of the traffic would actually use the ECMP as all of the traffic would be forced to one or the other RSVP LSP.
I would prefer the 1st option.

Juniper SRX240H loses connectivity to upstream router,"
Here's some version info that should help.  I think that the other thing that immediately strikes me is autonegotiation being disabled, which shouldn't be necessary.  Is this something that your provider is asking for, or based on learned behaviors?  I recommend reading what's out there, since autonegotiation has been recommended for over 10 years.  Anything you're connecting to should work fine with it as well (the last time I had issues was on a 3500XL - we're talking ooooold). Check out:

http://kb.juniper.net/InfoCenter/index?page=content&id=KB21476 (need login)
Also, JTAC recommends EEOL releases on SRX or J Series for IPsec features (may or may not apply, but FYI).  (For me, the only releases available for SRX240H on juniper.net are 10.4, 11.4, and 12.1 - that may help set your expectations on what to run.)

You are also running a version that was released before the malformed TCP vulnerability came out.  I shudder to think that a live exploit exists, but you definitely need to be on versions that were published around January or February 2013, or later.  The versions you need for 11.2 are 11.2R5.5 or 11.2R7.5 (or higher)

On a 2900/3900 platform, the UC license is required to use the CUCME/SRST functionality.  It is in addition to the base OS.  Once unlocked the commands will be available (no upgrade needed).
As of Unity express 7.0.2, the CUE modules are licensed separately for a given number of mailboxes.
Spare phones (with an = in the part number) are technically unlicensed.  You can use them with the system, as the CUCME router platform is licensed to a specific number of phones per hardware platform.  While you don't need the licenses to operate the phones, you should probably purchase them to stay on Cisco's good side.
CUBE should be unlocked with the UC licenses on the 2900/3900 platform.
For 30 phones, you probably want a 2911 or 2921.

Brett is right in that you probably need to contact a Cisco VAR/Partner to sort out the licensing issues.  They have people on staff that can take care of that for you and probably get you discount off list pricing.

cisco - Does varying the angle of omni directional antennas affect connection quality between WiFi APs?,"
It definitely matters:
'Omni' refers to the symmetry in the plane perpendicular to the axis of the antenna; That is, the torus around the antenna axis. But 'omni' antennas are VERY sensitive to variation from the vertical.
If you're aiming down into an open area (to the left, as suggested by the photo,) then ok, tip them as is shown. But generally, you should have the antenna at about the same height at the other trans/receivers you're trying to cover.
If that photo is your actual installation: Be aware that a metal roof -- especially if it's grounded, which it almost surely is -- will be an RF reflector. So you will have an RF shadow from the roof below the visual line of sight. (If you can't see the antenna, the RF signal won't go through the roof either.)

cabling - Multi-Mode and Single-Mode Fiber Differences,"
Main difference:
Singlemode fiber has a lower power loss characteristic than multimode fiber, which means light can travel longer distances through it than it can through multimode fiber. Not surprising, the optics required to drive singlemode fiber are way more expensive, especially considering any varying circumstances. 
When to use each:
Both singlemode and modern multimode fiber can handle 10G speeds.  The most important thing to consider is the distance requirement.  Within a data center, it's typical to use multimode which can get you 300-400 meters.  If you have very long runs or are connecting over longer distance, single mode can get you 10km, 40km, 80km, and even farther - you just need to use the appropriate optic for the distance required, and again, the prices go up accordingly.
Compatibility issues:
They are not compatible.  You cannot mix multimode and singlemode fiber between two endpoints.  The optics are not compatible either.
There's a lot more to say about fiber, in general, but I hope this answers your immediate question.

"wireless - intersymbol interference (ISI), channels, and frequencies","
These types of radio frequency transmissions are ""frequency division multiplexed"" (FDM). The different channels (ie, frequencies) transmit and receive at the same time. It's like a cocktail party where each conversation chooses a different pitch range -- the tenors have no problem hearing each other right through the basses at the next table.
In FDM, the receivers are tuned so that they only pickup transmissions in the channel (the frequency range) to which they are supposed to listen. So over a wider range (eg, the 2.4Ghz wifi) there are smaller divisions of frequency ranges into channels. The transmissions move at nearly the speed of light, so any transmitters on the same frequency -- the same channel in a give frequency band, eg 2.4Ghz's channel 11 -- will instantly be talking on top of each other. So any two 2.4Ghz channel 11 devices within range of each other will collide instantly.
Perhaps the part that isn't obvious is that electro-magnetic theory shows that superposition of E&M waves is not a problem. It's like waves in the open, ocean; You can have short spaced three foot waves (a highish frequency), moving over the surface at the same time you have long ocean swells (a lowish frequency). At the E&M receiver, you ""simply"" tune to the right frequency and you can pick the signals you want out of the noise. (And the E&M spectrums is very very noisy.)

architecture - What is backpressure in the context of routers?,"
Backpressure refers to what is essentially concentration of traffic.
E.g. I can have 10 x 1Gbit links internally that are all feeding into a 1Gbit link that provides me with Internet transit.
at saturation point, the router can store packets in its buffer and/or drop them - with no particular configuration, a router will generally fill its buffers and then tail drop, this gives rise to two problems: buffer-bloat and tcp global synchronisation.
The first refers to a case where the buffer is constantly filled due to constantly saturated link utilisation. The second refers to the issue of hosts re-transmitting dropped packets all at the same time, thereby causing a burst of traffic and thus, more drops, more retransmits, ad nauseum.
RED was conceived a long time ago as a means to deal with this issue; namely by randomly selecting packets to drop during times of congestion. This however required careful tuning according to the properties and expected behaviour of the link. Fortunately things have moved on and AQM (Active Queue Management) is now the cutting-edge of the industry.
A top-notch example of AQM is CoDeL - this is an algorithm that focuses purely upon the sojorn of a packet through the system and aims to ensure packets are passed within a specific time rather than caring about whether or not a certain amount of bandwidth/buffer is being utilised.

Tim to switch to IPv6? - Ntwork Enginring Stack Exchang,"
TL;DR: If you're a consumer/SOHO nothing needs doing. If you're providing services, start planning now while there's no rush and no deadline.
Basically, everything is dual stack these days, meaning it supports IPv4 and IPv6 out of the box. The Internet in general is still operating fully supporting IPv4 as much as possible.
At this point, if you're providing services to the Internet -- running DNS, web, email, etc. services. You should be planning to provide those services as both IPv4 and IPv6.
If you're consuming services from the Internet -- small office/home office, larger offices, residential, etc. then there is currently no urgency to convert yourself to IPv6. I suspect as the bigger cable companies start deploying IPv6 the ""last mile."" Then we'll see more IPv6 traffic in general.
Today, there are a lot of really big things -- Amazon, some of the content delivery networks -- which are only IPv4. So the focus, as I see it, is for the providers to continue working to provide evertyhing in IPv4 and IPv6 simultaneously. The first problem the Internet is going to face is fracturing/islands appearing as the newest areas, where IPv4 addresses are already exhausted, come online as IPv6-only. Those newest areas will need the existing services and service providers to offer stuff over IPv6.

dell - Multiple LAN interfaces on SonicWALL,"
Yes, The SonicWALL does this by default.
Go through the Setup Wizard and you can select the radio-button for the setup where X1 is WAN and all other ports are set to the LAN Zone.  You can also do two WAN interfaces and the rest to the LAN.  These are the options available in the Setup Wizard, but if you want to change more granuarly you can simply go to each interface and assign it to the appropriate Zone.    
Set your other three ports to LAN zone and the SonicWALL will switch all ports in that zone.

"Using Fabric on a Cisco device : ""Line has invalid autocommand""","
Fabric is designed with a certain execution model; It assumes something, Bash by default, will run on the remote to execute your command.
You can change what the remote command is though. You might try changing the remote command into a single space for when you're sending commands to something like a CLI (eg, Cisco IOS).
See Fabric's Environment Dictionary about the 'shell' setting.
"
ipv4 - IP prefixes by state (geolocation),"
You're looking for a ""Geo Location"" database. (One example I've used is Max Mind's products.)
The devil is in the implementation details. The db products are meant to be used programmatically. For example, given a list of IP addresses, we want to know the state, or lat/longitude, country, etc. You could certainly write something (e.g. some Perl code. But the products come with sample libraries for many laguages) that would spit out all the IP addresses, networks, whatever for a given state or zip code. You would have to look through the db products to see which one(s) are organized in a way you can use. Then you have to do something with that list.
Alternatively, you could do something dynamic. Hook into your web server, or server firewall, etc so that packets are looked up on the fly against the Geo Location database (the dbs are local data files you update periodically [eg monthly]) then make a decision, or insert a firewall rule.
None of that is easy, but it's definitely do-able.
"
Cisco Catalyst cluster heartbeat switch issue,"
CRC errors are often cabling problems. Here are the things I would check next before swapping out hardware:

Are the servers connected directly to the switch or do they connect through some sort of infrastructure cabling?  If so, get the infrastructure cables re-certified.
If you have a real cable tester (not a simple continuity tester), I would test the cables.
If the cables are hand made, I would replace with factory made cables.  Often run into these types of issues with hand made cables.
Check to see if there is any source of EM near where the cables run.  Re-path the cables if you can even temporarily to make sure they are kept separate from power or other sources of EM.

Beyond that, I would start at the NICs as you already indicated.  Could be you got some from a bad run.
"
cisco - Unable to connect via VPN to remote network,"
If both the Buffalo and the 5505 are doing NAT then yes you are bypassing best practices.
Unless you need the further level of security I would look to disable the routing abilities of the Buffalo and use it just as a wireless AP (as that is why I'm guessing you have it).
This may be as simple as turning off the DHCP server on the Buffalo and plugging the ASA into a LAN port on the Buffalo rather than the WAN port.
In terms of why your VPN doesn't work behind the Buffalo I am guessing it is blocking the VPN traffic, make sure that the Buffalo has something like 'VPN passthrough' enabled.
"
lab - Is it possible to emulate device other than Cisco and Juniper in GNS3 or any other environment?,"
What I recommend is to setup a virtualized environment. Either through Vmware workstation or preferably ESXi with vSphere if you have a server to spare. That gives you a very flexible solution.
Add a VM for Dynamips
Add Olives if you like
Add ASA either via Dynamips or separately
Add the Cisco CSR1000v VM
Add a VM for Arista

That makes it easy to run inter vendor labs and you can connect them through the VM network which makes it simple to setup. I have a lab like this now and it's hosted by a friend so a VPN in to a box he setup (virtual) which is my GW. Then I can configure vSphere and anything I like and run it on the server.
If you have a powerful laptop which 8GB RAM or more you can run a lot of stuff directly on your laptop. Most of these things are RAM heavy but not that heavy for the CPU.
"
switch - Are multiple links with different VLANs between two switches possible?,"
It depends. With IEEE 802.1Q specified STP, where you have one instance per trunk, STP will block ports. 
With Cisco's PVST+ (Per-VLAN STP), every VLAN has a corresponding instance of STP. This means that if there are no loops within the VLANs, STP will not block ports.
MST, defined in IEEE 802.1s, works a bit differently. Instead of providing a one-to-one VLAN-STP mapping, VLANs can be grouped together into a few instances of STP. This way, if you do STP odd-even load balancing (odd VLANs over link A, even over link B) you only need two instances of STP, instead of one instance for every single VLAN. If you use MST correctly, your proposed configuration should work without any blocked links, just like PVST+, but with VLANs grouped into instances instead of working with each VLAN independently.

These days it's usually at /48, and it's very unlikely to ever be longer.
There are still AS' filtering longer than /32 though, but they should all have a default at this point (Verizon were a hold-out, but I believe they've given up).
There are also AS' filtering on allocation lengths, so if you got a /32 they might require you advertise it as such (based on the various RIR's documented allocation policies).
"
Should spanning tree path costs match on a physical link?,"
According to the details you explain about your network topology, my understanding is: 

Cisco switch is root of the spanning-tree.
Port A4 in switch HP 7 is root port and therefore it is in forwarding
state
Port B1 in switch HP 8 is root port and therefore it is also in
forwarding state

Now let´s focus in the other link closing the loop, the one between both HP switches. You can have only a designated port and because the cost to root advertised by both HP switches into the link is the same, switches would have to check the lowest sender bridge ID and lowest sender port ID in order to choose the designated port and the blocking port. 
So, setting a different costs for ports in the link between HP switches will have  no effect in choosing the designated port for this link.
"
Is there a way to test TRILL in a virtual lab?,"
There are few devices that support standards based TRILL in the real world.
Traditional Cisco IOS is probably the most /supported/ network OS for running in a hypervisor; however, in Cisco land the NXOS platform is the only platform that supports Fabric Path (Cisco's TRILL), and that won't work in Dynamips or IOU.
Furthermore TRILL is a L2 technology. Switches are hard to virtualize because of the special forwarding hardware (TCAM) used in them.
In short I'm afraid you're out of luck on using virtual switches to test TRILL.
"
Why does my Cisco 6509 BGP table use two entries in my TCAM?,"
It seems that the 6500 generates MPLS labels for every route if BGP is run in VRF. The fact that your IPv4 and MPLS TCAM usage is almost identical seems to indicate this as well. Can you try this command:
show bgp vpnv4 uni all labels

There seems to be a hidden command that makes IOS allocate labels per VRF instead of per prefix.
mpls label mode all-vrfs protocol bgp-vpnv4 per-vrf

This is a hidden command so IOS won't show it.
Also before running that can you try to run:
show ip vrf detail

"
monitoring - Hardware tap vs port mirroring,"
(having worked with this for a decade now)
Hands down, the biggest functional difference between a tap and a span... a passive tap will never, ever drop a frame, under any circumstances -- it electrically duplicates the frame, errors and all.  Active taps (regenerative, or aggregate) can drop frames, eg. if the bidirectional traffic exceeds the link speed of the monitor port. (a 1G link cannot carry TX+RX 1G (2G) of traffic)
Switch SPAN ports will drop traffic.  The SPAN is the lowest priority to the switch -- it will sacrifice the SPAN traffic in favor of maintaining live traffic. A slightly loaded switch may never show this, but I've had dozens of customer calls from all over the world complaining that we dropped traffic, when it was in fact their switch SPAN that didn't send it to us.
However, SPANs are cheap and plentiful. Almost every managed switch supports setting up a monitor session.  And they are usually trivial to setup and/or reconfigure.  Taps, on the other hand, are exceedingly expensive and rare.  Taps require unplugging network cables, which has a lot of resistance from just about everyone. And they cause a hit when they lose power. (momentary, not ""unplugged == broken link"".  even dirt simple ones will maintain link when off.)
"
"How to find the port a device is connected to, based on IP, on a Cisco Catalyst switch","
The answer depends on whether the switch is a Layer 2 or a Layer 3 switch.  That is to say, is the switch only switching and relaying traffic on to a different device for routing, or, is it doing the routing decisions itself via SVIs (switched virtual interfaces).
On a layer 3 switch, the port can be found by using a few simple commands on the device.  However on a layer 2 switch, you have to log into both the switch and whatever device is doing the routing to locate the port.
In either case, the commands are the same, just run on two different boxes for the layer 2 switch.  

On a Layer 3 switch:

Log into the switch and issue the following command (where ipaddress is the ip address of the host you are trying to locate:
show ip arp *ipaddress*

The output should look similar to below, and give you the mac-address of the device (I've highlighted the mac-address below in bold).
LYKINS-1861#show ip arp 172.20.1.100
Protocol  Address          Age (min)  Hardware Addr   Type   Interface
Internet  172.20.1.100            0   **28cf.da1d.1b05**  ARPA   Vlan10

Now issue one of the following commands (where mac-address is the hardware address from previous step).  Depending on the Cisco platform, sometimes the command is listed in either form.
show mac address-table address *mac-address*
show mac-address-table address *mac-address*

The output should look similar to  below, the port you are looking for should be listed as the Destination Port:
LYKINS-1861#show mac-address-table address 28cf.da1d.1b05
Destination Address  Address Type  VLAN  Destination Port
-------------------  ------------  ----  --------------------
28cf.da1d.1b05          Dynamic      10     **FastEthernet0/1/1**



On a Layer 2 switch:

Find out what device is doing the routing for this switch (you may have to look at the network documentation). Sometimes it is a ""Router on a Stick"", where the Layer 2 VLANs are being trunked up to the router for the Layer 3 decisions.
Log into the routing device, and issue the following command (where ipaddress is the ip address of the host you are trying to locate:
show ip arp *ipaddress*

The output should look similar to below, and give you the mac-address of the device (listed below in bold).
LYKINS-1861#show ip arp 172.20.1.100
Protocol  Address          Age (min)  Hardware Addr   Type   Interface
Internet  172.20.1.100            0   **28cf.da1d.1b05**  ARPA   Vlan10

Now log into the Layer 2 switch
On that device issue one of the following commands (where mac-address is the hardware address from previous step).  Depending on the Cisco platform, sometimes the command is listed in either form.
show mac address-table address *mac-address*
show mac-address-table address *mac-address*

The output should look similar to  below, the port you are looking for should be listed as the Destination Port:
LYKINS-1861#show mac-address-table address 28cf.da1d.1b05
Destination Address  Address Type  VLAN  Destination Port

wireless - Cisco WLC External WebAuth Apparent Random Behavior,"
I've seen similar issues twice in the past. 
The first time, it had to do with DNS resolution. I performed a DNS lookup on a client that was having issues, and realized that the client wasn't capable of resolving the URL that I was passing for the login page. This was because I was passing an external DNS server. Check that first. I resolved that by passing the IP in the URL, although you could create a cname that resolves to 1.1.1.1.
The second time, it was a certificate issue. Some default browsers won't show the splash screen if the user must accept a self-signed certificate. I would test that by manually browsing to the splash screen or login page from a client that does not automatically show it.
Hope one of those helps you out. I know that I was ready to pull my hair out when I saw this the first time.

routing - How would a router with /32 WAN subnet mask communicate with the rest of the Internet?,"
DSL tends to use PPPoE, which means the link is point-to-point.  A /32 is perfectly valid here. In fact, no address at all is still valid -- one would need routable addresses beyond the PPP link, 'tho.  In this case, it works because there's only one possible destination on the link.  Every packet put on that link will be processed by the other end, and v.v.

cisco - How to connect 5 different networks together?,"
3 routers sounds like overkill to me but it would be interesting to see the topology and hear him explain the reason behind it.
Depending on your requirements for redundancy and/or loadbalancing a 1921/1941 could be fine for your needs. That would be only one device because it has both routing and switching if you stick a HWIC Etherswitch card in it. 
The high availability design would be to have two routers and two switches but then the servers should be dually connected as well.

juniper - What are some workarounds / fixes for UTM/IDP on Junos 12.1X44-D10.4 for SRX Series branch devices?,"
It appeared this was an easy fix (I also tried 12.1R6.5 and 12.1X44-D11.5, to no avail).
First, I looked at the version of the signature DB that it's trying to download (2263):
 netops> request security idp security-package download check-server    
 Successfully retrieved from(https://services.netscreen.com/cgi-bin/index.cgi).
 Version info:2263(Detector=12.6.160130325, Templates=2263)

Then, I decided that this is possibly an actual bad md5 checksum (per what Junos expects), and I downloaded the previous version, 2262:
 netops> request security idp security-package download version full-update 2262    
 Will be processed in async mode. Check the status using the status checking CLI

It worked!  I've had to do something similar on Netscreen, but it's been a while.  I turned off automated updates, and I can get back to studying.
 netops> request security idp security-package download status    
 Done;Successfully downloaded from(https://services.netscreen.com/cgi-bin/index.cgi).
 Version info:2262(Tue May 14 16:27:00 2013 UTC, Detector=12.6.160130325)

Now that the download is finished, everything is installing properly:
 netops> request security idp security-package install          
 Will be processed in async mode. Check the status using the status checking CLI

 netops> request security idp security-package install status

 etc.

 Updating control-plane with new detector : successful
 Updating data-plane with new attack or detector : not performed
  due to no active policy configured.

I'm thinking that this is either a bug in SRX110H-VA, a combination of hardware/software release, or bad signature updates on services.netscreen.com.  I'm pretty sure that I could just look through the XML, and figure out where the bad md5sum is (and fix it by hand), but I'll follow up once I hear back from Juniper.
Newest edit: I also had to manually download the policy template from Juniper, extract it with gzip -d templates.xml.gz, and place it in /var/db/idpd/sec-download/sub-download/.  Once that was done, I was able to install it.  The issue here is that the request security idp security-package install policy-templates command does not take a 'version', like the other idp commands.  This will always be an issue when the head IDP policy has md5 errors, although I would hope that this isn't a frequent occurrence at Juniper.

"
cisco ios 12 - Configuring HSRP on Nexus OS,"
On a Cisco Nexus switch, the syntax for HSRP is actually ""HSRP"" instead of ""Standby"".
In my experience, it makes it easier to troubleshoot as you know immediately which redundancy protocol you're dealing with (HSRP, GLBP, or VRRP).
See this Cisco doc for more information on HSRP on the Nexus 7000 platform.

First, be sure that you have enabled HSRP on the device:
switch-b(config)#feature hsrp

Then go into the interface and issue the command ""hsrp groupnumber"".   You will then be able to enter your configuration similarly to in IOS.  This actually takes you into a sub-configuration mode as shown below:
switch-b(config)#interface Eth1/1 
switch-b(config-if)#ip address 10.1.1.3/24
switch-b(config-if)#hsrp 10
switch-b(config-if-hsrp)#preempt
switch-b(config-if-hsrp)#priority 90
switch-b(config-if-hsrp)#ip 10.1.1.1

Don't forget to ""no shut"" the interface, but then that should do it!

Also, I just realized that Cisco has a great writeup on these differences here on their DocWiki.
"
Cisco ISR G2 encrypted bandwidth restriction?,"
You are running into one of the fun, new, restrictions of the ISR Generation 2.
I assume you have the basic ""security"" licensing package installed as noted by this part of the message:
securityk9 technology package license

However the securityk9 package is Cisco's ""unrestricted export"" version of that license, and will artificially limit you.  You need the hseck9 package.  See this white paper for more information.  It says in part:

The HSEC-K9 license removes the curtailment enforced by the U.S. government export restrictions on the encrypted tunnel count and encrypted throughput. HSEC-K9 is available only on the Cisco 2921, Cisco 2951, Cisco 3925, Cisco 3945, Cisco 3925E, and Cisco 3945E. 
With the HSEC-K9 license, the ISR G2 router can go over the curtailment limit of 225 tunnels maximum for IP Security (IPsec) and encrypted throughput of 85-Mbps unidirectional traffic in or out of the ISR G2 router, with a bidirectional total of 170 Mbps.
The Cisco 1941, 2901, and 2911 already have maximum encryption capacities within export limits. The HSEC license requires the universalk9 image and the SEC license pre-installed.


A quick way to check which license you have, is to issue the following command on your router:
show license feature

This will show you which licenses you have purchased from Cisco and installed on this router.  You need to make sure that the hseck9 license is enabled.  Otherwise you will be limited to that 85Mbps limit for encrypted traffic.  Which on circuits below 100Mbps, might not be an issue, and you could safely ignore this problem.  Either way, see this page for more information on installing the new license once you purchase it.

Another handy command for troubleshooting this is:
show platform cerm-information

This will either spit out a list of information about the limits in place, including the failed encrypt/decrypt packet counts, or it will give you the following:
router-1#show platform cerm-information 
Crypto Export Restrictions Manager(CERM) Information:
 CERM functionality: DISABLED

cisco asa - ASA5505 and IPv6 over a PPPoE Link,"
As per the advice from Ricky Beam I opened a Cisco TAC case for this issue, just to see what the official word is:

Hi Mark,

Juniper SRX240 Clustering - Policy out of sync,"
You description is implying the issue is between the primary and secondary nodes, but the article is referencing an out of sync between the Control Plane and Data Plane ( or Routing Engine and Packet Forwarding Engine. 
If it is indeed the PFE out of Sync you might also try the hidden command 'commit full'.
I know I had an issue where my 2 routing engines were out of sync. I don't recall if it was on a cluster SRX or something like a VC switch or dual RE router. In my case it was because I had issued a 'commit confirmed' and let the timer expire. The backup RE was out of sync. I had to log into the backup RE and manually do a 'rollback 1' to get them back in sync.
"
cisco - Are there any reasons to not use BFD?,"
I am only directly aware of one issue with BFD, which is CPU demand. I am currently investigating an issues with a Cisco 7301 which when pushing more traffic during our peak hours, compared to the rest of the day, BFD is sometimes timing out and routing trips over to the next link.
It seems that under high traffic volumes the router CPU usage is rising (which isn't unusual) but at about 40-50% CPU BFD packets aren't receiving enough resources.
However I have found the following information which suggests additional issues with BFD (From this NANOG presentation, there is more in the presentation, it's a good one, give it a read!)
What are the caveats?

Two main ones:

BFD can have high resource demands depending on your
scale.
BFD is not visible to Layer 2 bundling protocols. (Ethernet
LAGs or POS bundles)


BFD Resource Demands

The number of BFD sessions on each linecard or router can
impact how well BFD scales for you.
-Each unique platform has its own limits.
Bundled interfaces supporting min tx/rx of 250ms or 2 seconds have
been seen.
In some cases, BFD instances on a router may need to be operated on
the route-processor depending on the implementation (non-adjacency
based BFD sessions).
Test your platform first before deploying BFD. Attempt to put
load on the RP or LC CPU with your configured settings. This
can be done by:
Executing CPU-heavy commands
Flooding packets to TTL expire on the destination

BFD Resource Demands (cont’d)

What values are safe to try?
Based upon speaking to several operators, 300ms with a
multiplier of 3 (900ms detection) appears to be a safe value
that works on most equipment fairly well.
This is a significant improvement over some of the
alternatives.

BFD and L2 link-bundling

BFD is unaware of underlying L2 link bundle members.
A 4x10GigE L2 bundle (802.3ad) would appear as a single L3
adjacency. BFD packets would be transmitted on a single
member link, rather than out all 4 links.
A failure of the link with BFD on it would result in the entire L3
adjacency failing.
However, in some scenarios the failed member link may result in only a
single BFD packet being dropped. Subsequent packets may route over
working member links.

As you can see it matches on different DSCP values. DSCP EF is generally used for VoIP. This means that your packets should already have been marked as early as possible in your network. The bandwidth values are entered in percent which means that the policy can applied on different speed interfaces and still provide good values compared to entering them in kbit/s. On very high speed interfaces like 10 Gbit it could be a lot to use 7% for control traffic though since that would be 700 Mbit/s.
Both the data and the class-default uses fair-queue which is a way of queueing packets based on DSCP and packet size to provide fair queueing even for small packet flows. To be able to use this you need an image supporting Hierarchical Queing Framework (HQF) which is 12.4(20)T or newer.
Weighted Random Early Detection (WRED) is also applied to take care of issues like TCP synchronization where TCP flows will speed up and back off at the same time.
Then you have the 8 class model.

"
monitoring - How can I capture traffic on Cisco IOS switches?,"
The client switchport or the server switchport can be monitored. A third switchport can be configured as a mirror port. This means that this mirror port will receive copies of all packets on the corresponding original port, while the original traffic won't be affected.
For example, on the Catalyst 3560:

Enter configuration mode:
conf t

Define the source and set the session number:
monitor session 1 source interface fa 0/24

Here, the session number can be from 1 to 66, you could also specify a VLAN or an ethernet channel. Also, interface ranges such as fa 0/25 - 26 are possible, and interface list, such as fa 0/24,fa 0/26, if you would like to monitor several clients at the same time. Also by repeating the command you can add ports, or remove using no. Mixing ports and VLANs is not possible in the same session, another restriction is that you cannot use a destination port as a source port. 
Define the destination port:
monitor session 1 destination interface gi 0/1

You can use a normal port, but not a VLAN. Similarly to above, a destination port cannot be a source port: a port used here can either be a source or a destination port, and only of one session. Again, you can specify multiple ports like above.
You may want to exit configiration mode and save the config.
You may have a look at your defined session - here multiple ports, tried like above:
#show monitor session 1
Session 1
---------
Type                   : Local Session
Source Ports           :
    Both               : Fa0/24,Fa0/25-26
Destination Ports      : Fa0/48,Gi0/1
    Encapsulation      : Native
          Ingress      : Disabled

You can see an encapsulation here - optionally you can set it to replicate for replicating the source interface encapsulation method, such as by adding encapsulation replicate after the source interface. Furthermore, you can specify a direction (tx, rx, both), filter VLANs and more. The Ingress: Disabled line means that the switch will not accept any frames presented to it by your capture device on a destination port. For such finer details and for further restrictions and default settings have a look at the command reference of the IOS version of your switch. 

Once you configured source and destination port, you can capture the traffic using your laptop connected to the destination port, for example with Wireshark.
The number of source sessions can be limited, for example the 3560 supports a maximum of 2.
After the capturing, don't forget to remove this session configuration.
"
ipv4 - How can I formulate the communication latency in TCP/IP?,"
This is a very complicated process, so to formulate an equation that could be useful for accurately predicting RTTs is extremely difficult. At best, I would say you could create a model that using a bunch of averages for each stage, that you could tweak if you happen to ""know better"" for a particular situation is about as close as you can get. This is something I am presently studying so I can tell you what I know so far (from the ground up, starting at the physical layer):

See my questions on the Electronics SE; Encoding delay of Ethernet and the relation to cable frequency rating and Speed of electricity (signal propagation?) through copper for communications delay. Since you would be using standardised speeds (100Mbps, 1Gbps, 10Gbps etc), don't treat fibre or copper differently. The ""delay"" down the two is near as damn it the same, but copper can't carry a signal as far obviously. I have this question on the Physics SE site, which I do know the answer to now. I just need to find the time to right it up, so keep an eye on that if you are interested (I will be posting some more telecoms-use-of-fibre related questions to which I now know the answer when I get a chance).
Much more delay is going to be added in by the devices at the end of a link. There is no standard way of saying ""oh 2 switches along a path is Xms delay, 4 switches is 2*Xms, 2 routers is Yms...etc"". Assuming you are using say 1Gpbs for example and the devices in the path forward at line rate, we know that is 1000000000bps, so the physical interface is running at a fixed encoding rate (ranging from 1 nanosecond per bit up to whatever the max of the symbol encoding scheme in use is, such as 10b)
There are three main kinds of delay (at the physical layer) you need to be aware of and factor in; Serialisation delay, encoding delay, propagation delay (and processing delay, queueing delay, encode and decoding delay, but these are above the physical layer but need mentioning!). These are reasonably well documented on the Internet, VoIP: An In-Depth Analysis, Slide 13 here, loads on Google Scholar, and many more.
As we move up the protocol stack, I would work on the assumption that the destination MAC is in each switches cam table, and at the IP layer, the destination MAC in ARP tables. The extra delay induced by these discovery processes only occurs for the first packet in a flow so they can be circumvented by raising time-outs and sending gratuitous ARPs etc.
As you get to the application layer this is going to get really difficult because this depends on the server (for example) processing the request, which will be subject to interrupt delay. The number of interrupts required to process the request and context switches due to load is unpredictable.

I would very much like to help you with your question, sadly this is all I have time for right now. I will update this answer maybe later tonight or tomorrow, I wanted to post what I have so far.
In the mean time, most people tend to work with the figure for the delay at a physical copper/fibre layer of around 0.6*c (C = speed of light). Also, you need to think about TCP's exchange of ACKs every X packets, which differs if you are using SACK for example, and if you're using jumbo frames and/or larger MSS size (now MTU needs to be factored in also!), if you're sending more in-between ACKs (if volume of data transferred is of interest to you). You also need to factor in the infamous Bandwidth Delay Product and don't make the stupid misinterpretation that I did of that page. I started making various simple (and very ugly) data calculators here. Again a work in progress I will try and update them soon. I plan to add a calculator similar to what you are trying to do. I have also made some light and fibre calculators if you are interested, but again, no time!, I haven't gotten round to uploading them yet. I will try ASAP to update this answer some more, in the coming days.
P.S. I forgot to mention QoS! If QoS is in play anywhere in the path, it's going to get really tough to caluclate the RTT!
"
How can I reset a VPN tunnel on a Cisco ASA?,"
The VPN can be reset by entering
clear crypto ipsec sa peer <remote-peer-IP>

on one side. The following traffic will cause the IPSEC tunnel to be reestablished.
You can do it on your side, entering the remote IP. Or login to the remote site, but possibly you have to do it outside the VPN, so using a different interface, for example using the public IP instead of the IP to which you connect through the tunnel.
There will be a short VPN outage while reestablishing the tunnel. After entering that command, ensure that the tunnel is up again, such as doing a ping through it.
"
cisco - How can I see which switchports are not in use?,"
I frequently use
sh int | i (FastEthernet|0 packets input)

or the same with GigabitEthernet, whatever kind of interfaces I want to check.

sh int (which is show interfaces) gives a huge list of ste status of all interfaces
The pipe symbol | can be used for filtering, but also in search expressions 
| i (for include) filters the output which matches the following search expressions
I use (...|...) to match two conditions: the interface name and a status I like to see, we can use regular expressions here, like this ""or"" expression

The output can look like:
...
FastEthernet1/0/31 is up, line protocol is up (connected)
     95445640 packets input, 18990165053 bytes, 0 no buffer
FastEthernet1/0/32 is up, line protocol is up (connected)
FastEthernet1/0/33 is up, line protocol is up (connected)
FastEthernet1/0/34 is down, line protocol is down (notconnect)
     0 packets input, 0 bytes, 0 no buffer
FastEthernet1/0/35 is down, line protocol is down (notconnect)
FastEthernet1/0/36 is up, line protocol is up (connected)
FastEthernet1/0/37 is down, line protocol is down (notconnect)
     0 packets input, 0 bytes, 0 no buffer
...

Now I can see my candidates, with actually 0 packets input over time, even if my expression matches numbers just ending with 0. I could make it more perfect, but being easy to remember is also a benefit. The interface names right before each 0 packets input lines are my candidates.

Check each chosen interface if it's really unused by sh int <name>
From time to time, it's good to clear the counters: clear counters [type number]

It can be good practice, to leave unused switchports shutdown. So it's easy to identify them using sh ip int bri or the like. And you don't run into problems if you use a switchport which was definitly shut off before.
"
"switch - Why does ""show interface"" show ""Last input never"" when packets input is incrementing?","
There are several interface counters that don't work as well as they used to.  Sometimes this is because the chassis/router has a 'fast' switching mode (CEF, or something else), and that particular 'bucket' never gets hit.  Another reason might be that that particular counter only works in L3 mode instead of L2 mode.  This kind of stuff is quite common, unfortunately on cisco products, particularly on the 6500 which has an enormous amount of legacy code/architecture weighing it down.
"
"security - What is the name of these broadband street cabinet connectors, and are they secure?","
""Connectors""??? The blue distribution block? (possibly a distribution amp) The little ""caps"" -- actually terminators? Or the RG-59 compression crimps on the cables?
It's as secure as the cabinet. (which is often not that secure) Almost everything on a cable network these days is encrypted, so a physical tap wouldn't do as much good as you might think.  And it's all a shared medium anyway, anyone on that block can see everyone else's traffic.
The mess on the right appears to be analog POTS lines, but could be anything.
"
"monitoring - How can I capture traffic on a Brocade XMR, MLX, CER or CES?","
The best solution is to plug a computer running a packet analysis software like Wireshark to an unused port and duplicate the traffic to this port. This is called mirroring and monitoring. Here is how to do this on a Brocade MLX, XMR, CER or CES :
First configure the mirroring port. This is the port you will plug you packet analyzer, ethe 3/1 here.
Brocade(config)# mirror-port ethernet 3/1

Next, go to a port where the traffic you want to see is flowing (here, ethe 4/1), and specify this is a monitored port, and where you want the traffic to be sent :
Brocade(config)# interface ethernet 4/1
Brocade(config-if-4/1)# monitor ethernet 3/1 both

Note : both can be replaced by either input or output if you only want to analyze input or output traffic.
For more information, see the documentation.

cisco asa - Will ASA 5540 support 3000 simultaneous IPsec connections?,"
In our HQ's DC, we have a dual 100 Mbps Internet Gateway Router (that's our bottle neck for the WAN). We've had 500-700 sites connect back after an outage at once with no issue - easily sustaining 2800 locations full time. The spec's say it can support 5000 total, just make sure you order the right Memory + CPU specs as well, more memory than anything else.
Your bottle neck will be your WAN connection from my experience.

"monitoring - Daily, Weekly and Monthly Reports from Solarwinds?","
They keep moving things into the web interface but the reports are in a separate app called ""Report Writer"" on the server desktop so you'll have to RDP or physically connect to the server to get to it. There's also a ""Report Scheduler"" where you'll need add the reports once you've created them.
I've never found their reporting very useful but you may have better luck depending on what you want. In the past I know they've recommended using Crystal Reports against their database to pull detailed reports.

It turns out we ran into a node limit on the FWSM.  Evidently you can be within your rule limit but hit the node ceiling.  This doc https://supportforums.cisco.com/docs/DOC-8786 details the compilation memory exhaustion issue that hit us.  Quoting:

This command show np 3 acl stats in the context in question will show
  if the total nodes is reached. This limit may be reached even before
  the ACL limit is reached. Each ACE may take a minimum of 2 nodes to a
  maximum up to to 5 nodes depending on where the ACL is being called.
  The ACL that is tied to MPF (modular policy framework) may take up
  more nodes than the ACL that is tied to a NAT or to the access-group.
  There is no way to calculate the number of nodes. The best way to
  monitor this is to regularly look at the above output to make sure the
  node count is not exceeded.

RESOLUTION:
1. Power down the secondary FWSM and power on the primary.
2. Revise our configuration by examining which rules could be removed (stale rules and recent changes allowing certain Development environments access to Production) in order to bring down the rule and therefore node count.
3. Ensure the new config compiles then reset the primary FWSM.
4. Verify the FWSM comes up clean with no errors.
5. Power down the primary FWSM and power up the secondary FWSM.
6. Repeat steps 3 and 4 with the secondary FWSM then power it down.
7. Power on the primary, ensure it's clean, power on the secondary.
8. Ensure the primary's config is copied to the secondary and that the primary is Active and sees the secondary as Standby.
MITIGATION:
1. We upgraded our development environment (2 x 6509 with Active/Standby FWSM) to FWSM version 4.1(13) from 3.2(23).  The upgrade to the 4.x train increased the maximum node count for us from 28,356 to 38,439.  More information: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/modules/ps2706/product_bulletin_c25-478751.html.
2. We will upgrade our Production FWSM during the next change window.
3. We implemented a Kiwi CatTools job to run the show np 3 acl stats command in our contexts and e-mail us a daily report.  Whenever we make a rule change we also run this command to ensure we're within node and rule limits.
It's interesting behavior that the FWSM would allow us to continue adding rules.  It only failed when it was power cycled and tried to compile the rule set.  Lessons learned!
"
cisco asa - ASA 5550 - Reboot Worthwhile?,"
Short answer: Yes.
Longer answer: :-) There are bugs in every piece of software.  The longer it runs, the more likely one is going to setup shop in your network.  But more to the point, the longer it's gone without a reboot, the more little bits of ""old"" configuration and/or status will be left lingering.  In IOS, no interface foo will emit a warning that it's not completely destroyed and configuration elements may reappear if you recreate the interface -- shouldn't happen in an ASA but in rare cases, it does.  I've also seen phantom NAT entries after deleting them from the config. (that one actually is a bug)
When dealing with IPSec/crypto, I've found a whole lot of crazy can be cleared up by a reload.  In one case (pix 6.3.5) it wouldn't re-establish a VPN tunnel until I did.
[edit] A word on reboots in general: I tend to reboot things just to make sure they will.  All too often I've had various systems (routers, firewalls, servers) running for extended periods -- constantly being modified, and when something ends up restarting them (usually a power outage, but ""oops, wrong machine"" happens too) they rarely come back up exactly as they were before... someone forgot to make X start at boot, or some odd interaction of parts makes something not startup as expected.  I admit, it's less of a concern for more static parts of one's infrastructure.
"
qinq - Cisco 7600 q-in-q functionality on a Cisco 6500,"
6500 is generally MPLS ready in terms of label support, LDP support and things like VRFs for MPLS VPNs. Some features may be missing because of specific choice of software and hardware.
For example, in your configuration, you'll have very small FIB for services - you have only PFC3B which can hold 256k IPv4 prefixes, or 128k IPv6 prefixes, or half of that for MPLS VPN services (MPLS label takes two entries basically).
Second problem you may hit is the fact that while the 6748 LC you have has MPLS tagging support, it will only do 802.1q tunneling - if you need 802.1q swapping and elastic modifications/etc there is a a whole set of different restrictions (port groups) which you can start to deep dive into here:
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/lan/catalyst6500/ios/12.2SX/configuration/guide/dot1qtnl.html#wp1006495
Essentially, for 6500 to function as fully fledged metro ethernet edge you'll either need SIP linecards (SIP-200 and SIP-400) or ES/ES+ linecards, which are by itself feature-rich for services like tag swapping, services termination, QoS/HQoS etc. The ""LAN cards"" as they're called (WS-X6[1357]xx series) are limited in QoS and L2 manipulation flexibility. 
"
How do I obtain access to buy from Cisco directly?,"
(while not network engineering per-se, it's a good question)
Unless you plan on buying millions in equipment and/or software annually, Cisco will not want to deal with you directly.  This is especially true if you're only interested in individual purchases -- that's why they have resellers and channel partners.  If you are, then Cisco will assign you a sales person and sales engineer to meet your needs.
Becoming a partner/reseller is an involved process, well beyond the scope of stackexchange. (that's a ""how do I start a business"" question.)
"
Oversubscription in cisco 6500,"
It sounds like you're talking about the WS-X6716-10GE.  Over-subscription in this context means you have a 16 x 10GE ports on the front of the LC and no more than 4x10GE at the fabric connection to the rest of the chassis.
Over-subscription will not matter if you locally switch traffic within the same linecard; however, you will only be able to send up to your fabric connection (i.e. 40Gbps) to other linecards in the same chassis.  So it's possible to get blocking or drops if your links congest the fabric connections.

ethernet - Why does 1000BASE-T need Auto-MDIX?,"
1000Base-T strictly speaking does not need auto-MIDX.  However, when the standard was written, inter-operation with older technologies was taken into account.  So to keep things simple, when communicating with a 100base or 10base device, auto-MIDX is there so crossover cables are no longer necessary.
Edit: I forgot to mention, while auto-MIDX is in the standard, it is an optional feature, so it may not be present in all hardware.

ppp - Please help me understand this ADSL configuration,"
You are familiar with IP over PPP over ATM.
The config you don't understand is IP over ATM, that is the ATM frames are directly transporting IP frames.
ATM was designed to carry many different protocols using many different encoding methods. 
One reason some operators (mostly central Europe) choose to add PPP in to the mix is because it allows them to offer access to other operators relatively easily, i.e. the PPP sessions would actually terminate with another operator not where your physical connection is.
3rd common way to do this is IP over Ethernet over ATM, which is yet another config.
"
ethernet - Introductory level explanation of VLANs,"
A VLAN (Virtual LAN) is a way of creating multiple virtual switches inside one physical switch. So for instance ports configured to use VLAN 10 act as if they're connected to the exact same switch. Ports in VLAN 20 can not directly talk to ports in VLAN 10. They must be routed between the two (or have a link that bridges the two VLANs).
There are a lot of reasons to implement VLANs. Typically the least of these reasons is the size of the network. I'll bullet list a few reasons and then break each one open.

Security
Link Utilization
Service Separation
Service Isolation
Subnet Size

Security:
Security isn't itself achieved by creating a VLAN; however, how you connect that VLAN to other subnets could allow you to filter/block access to that subnet. For instance if you have an office building that has 50 computers and 5 servers you could create a VLAN for the server and a VLAN for the computers. For computers to communicate with the servers you could use a firewall to route and filter that traffic. This would then allow you to apply IPS/IDS,ACLs,Etc. to the connection between the servers and computers.
Link Utilization:
(Edit)I can't believe I left this out the first time. Brain fart I guess. Link utilization is another big reason to use VLANs. Spanning tree by function builds a single path through your layer 2 network to prevent loops (Oh, my!). If you have multiple redundant links to your aggregating devices then some of these links will go unused. To get around this you can build multiple STP topology with different VLANs. This is accomplished with Cisco Proprietary PVST, RPVST, or standards based MST. This allows you to have multiple STP typologies you can play with to utilize your previously unused links. In example if I had 50 desktops I could place 25 of them in VLAN 10, and 25 of them in VLAN 20. I could then have VLAN 10 take the ""left"" side of the network and the remaining 25 in VLAN 20 would take the ""right"" side of the network.
Service Separation:
This one is pretty straight forward. If you have IP security cameras, IP Phones, and Desktops all connecting into the same switch it might be easier to separate these services out into their own subnet. This would also allow you to apply QOS markings to these services based on VLAN instead of some higher layer service (Ex: NBAR). You can also apply ACLs on the device performing L3 routing to prevent communication between VLANs that might not be desired. For instance I can prevent the desktops from accessing the phones/security cameras directly.
Service Isolation:
If you have a pair of TOR switches in a single rack that has a few VMWare hosts and a SAN you could create a iSCSI VLAN that remains unrouted. This would allow you to have an entirely isolated iSCSI network so that no other device could attempt to access the SAN or disrupt communication between the hosts and the SAN. This is simply one example of service isolation.
Subnet Size:
As stated before if a single site becomes too large you can break that site down into different VLANs which will reduce the number of hosts that see need to process each broadcast.
There are certainly more ways VLANs are useful (I can think of several that I use specifically as an Internet Service Provider), but I feel these are the most common and should give you a good idea on how/why we use them. There are also Private VLANs that have specific use cases and are worth mentioning here.
"
ethernet - speed/duplex mismatch,"
To address your questions in order:

Mismatches occur when auto-negotiation or manual configurations fails. This may be caused by physical layer issues or because manual configurations do not agree. Physical issues could be something like an inline hub or physical cable (missing/broken pairs) issues.
Duplex mismatches can cause a significant impact to your network performance. Collisions, particularly late ones, can take a long time (relatively speaking) for the TCP stack to recover from. Collisions with UDP means the data may never get there or require an application layer recovery mechanism.
Resolving mismatches is absolutely worth your time resolving. It may also hint at other issues since duplex/speed should be an assumed thing these days.
Some of the centralized management tools (Solarwinds, Spiceworks, HP OpenView & others) probably have reports for interface errors which should include these types of issues.

"
ethernet - MAC address recycling?,"
MAC-48 has a maximum of 2^48 possible addresses which is somewhere in the neighborhood of 281 trillion different addresses(Compared to IPv4 which has around 4.2 billion). That said I've seen some studies and estimates saying that we won't have to worry about exhaustion until around 2100. The IEEE is one organization that supports this estimate. By that time we may not even being using MAC addresses anymore. Additionally there is another standard called EUI-64 which provides 2^64 possible addresses(24 being the OUI and 40 being the individual card number). 
To answer your question about recycling, I don't imagine vendors do it nor that IEEE supports vendors doing it. When assigning local MAC addresses a network admin could do it but I can't imagine why you would want to.

redundancy - Expanding an HP IRF topology,"
I'm not HP savvy but I did some quick Googling (hp irf ring topology) and found a couple of docs that indicate it does support a ring topology.

c02648772.pdf

Quote from page 5: 

IRF topologies
Create an IRF virtual device in daisy chain topology,
  or more reliably, ring topology, as shown in Figure 2. In ring chain
  topology, the failure of one IRF link does not cause the IRF virtual
  device to split as in daisy chain topology. Rather, the IRF virtual
  device changes to a daisy chain topology without affecting network
  services.

This page has the same quote so at least that seems like a possibility.
HP seems to be recommending the ring but beyond that I can't speak to HP gear.

management - Running XML agent on IOS XR,"
In IOS-XR, there are different concepts of authorization than in classic IOS.  In classic IOS, there's only command authorization, which allows or denies specific commands, typically sent to a tacacs+ or radius server.  In IOS-XR, there is command authorization (aaa authorization commands) (but you're better off doing this via task-groups) and exec authorization(aaa authorization exec) , which controls who can actually start an exec session.  
It appears that using the normal access method (ssh/telnet to the vtys) that if you're authenticated, no other authorization is necessary, but if you start the XML agent on its own dedicated port, then that use must be authorized.  In my particular case, we are using a TACACS server for authentication, and I was specifying to use local authorization.  The username does not exist on the router, so using the local method 'aaa authorization exec default local' caused authorization to fail.  Changing it to 'aaa authorization exec group tacacs+ local' caused it to get the 'authorization OK' from the TACACS servers, and all is well.

ipv4 - What is the use of wild card masks vs normal masks,"
As I understand it, the question is what is the reason for the two different masks, not what are the differences between the masks. The two questions overlap somewhat, but it comes down to binary math (as YLearn hits on).
First, a netmask:
IP:   1100 0000 . 1010 1000 . 1111 1000 . 0110 0100 = 192.168.248.100
Mask: 1111 1111 . 1111 1111 . 1111 1111 . 1111 1000 = 255.255.255.248
AND:  1100 0000 . 1010 1000 . 1111 1000 . 0110 0000 = 192.168.248.96

The AND operation on the IP address with the netmask results in the network 192.168.248.96/29.
Next, a wildcard:
NET:  1100 0000 . 1010 1000 . 1111 1000 . 0110 0000 = 192.168.248.96
WC:   0000 0000 . 0000 0000 . 0000 0000 . 0000 0111 = 0.0.0.7
OR:   1100 0000 . 1010 1000 . 1111 1000 . 0110 0111 = 192.168.248.103

performing an OR operation on the network results in the range of IPs (192.168.248.96-103) that may be permitted or blocked in an ACL or OSPF network statement (remember that OSPF only looks for interfaces that fall within the specified ranges -- i.e. it doesn't match IP and netmask, just the IP). It's very easy to check whether an IP is in range with:

IP OR WC == NET OR WC

This is useful to the router because the netmask does not easily give you this information (without additional operations).

"
routing - BGP - Soft Reset Outbound & Verification,"
Soft reconfig (inbound) is only used if route refresh isn't supported (you also have to explicitly configure this); They're two different things. Does ""show ip bgp neighbor x.x.x.x"" output show route refresh in its advertised capabilities - ""advertised & received""? To answer your question, the only way that you can verify that the ""soft reconfig out"" took effect (because this basically tells your router to refresh your outbound policy and send the updates to the neighbor) is to verify this with your provider.
Edit: To clarify, I suppose it depends on what policy you're trying to set. You can always do ""show ip bgp neigh x.x.x.x advertised-routes"" but AFAIK you can't get all the bits of info, i.e. communities (disclaimer: this was how it worked with Cisco kit I've worked on, not sure if Juniper/whomever else is better here or not).
One last edit (to clear up any possible confusion):
Soft reconfig inbound is used really to refresh your inbound policy in accordance to what someone is sending you. It basically stores a copy of the Adj-RIB(s)-In and when ""clear ip bgp neigh x.x.x.x soft in"" is run, it refreshes your inbound policy by applying it to the [copy] Adj-RIB-In prefixes before inserting them into the Loc-RIB.
With the route refresh capability, it eliminates the need to store a copy of the Adj-RIB-In and (assuming the neighbor supports it) will allow you to request a route refresh from the neighbor via just doing ""clear ip bgp neigh x.x.x.x in"" - no ""soft"" needed. In addition, even if your neighbor is capable of route refresh, and you've configured that neighbor with soft-reconfig, the soft-reconfig will take precedence over route refresh (not ideal due to the increased memory footprint with running soft-reconfig).
Soft reconfig outbound (you don't need anything to turn this on, you get it for free) will re-run your Loc-RIB (Adj-RIB-Out is just a pointer back to the Loc-RIB) through your outbound policies and send those updates to the peer.
"
cisco - Difference between access list and prefix list?,"
Here's the history of how they came into being (and why they are the way they are):

In the very early days of the Internet, people started asking for packet filters (aka access lists). 
Cisco implemented simple access lists first (filtering on destination host addresses, augmented by wildcard masks), but of course they weren't good enough to block (for example) SMTP, so they created extended access lists, which can match on source and destination IP addresses (with wildcards bits on both - these bits allow you to match whole prefixes), protocols, port numbers ...

So: access list = packet filter.
Later (but still decades ago) people started running multiple routing protocols on the same box and wanted to redistribute information between them. Not a problem, but you wouldn't want ALL the information you have propagated into the other routing protocol - you need ROUTE FILTERS. As is usually the case, everything looks like a nail if you happen to have a hammer, and thus Cisco's engineers implemented route filters with the object they already had - access lists.
At this point: access list = packet filter (and sometimes route filter)
With the advent of classless routing (yeah, it's that long ago - does anyone still remember the days of Class A, Class B and Class C addresses), people wanted to redistribute prefixes of certain size between routing protocols. For example: advertise all /24s from OSPF into BGP, but not the /32s. Impossible to do with access lists. Time for a new kludge: let's use extended access list and let's pretend the source IP address in the packet filter represents network address (actually prefix address) and the destination IP address in the same line of the packet filter represents subnet mask.
This far: access lists = packet filters. Simple access lists also serve as route filters (matching only on network addresses) and extended access lists serve as route filters matching addresses and subnet masks.
Fortunately someone retained a shred of reason at that time and started wondering what exactly the brilliant minds that decided reusing extended ACLs for route filters makes sense were smoking when they got that brilliant idea. 
End result: Cisco IOS got prefix lists, which are (almost) identical in functionality to extended access lists acting as route filters, but displayed in a format that a regular human being has a chance of understanding.
Today: use access lists for packet filters and prefix lists for route filters. You can still use access lists as route filters but don't do it.
Makes sense?
"
routing - What are the differences between VRRP and HSRP?,"
Besides VRRP not being proprietary, there are a few minor differences between the protocols as well:

With HSRP, each interface must have an IP address that is separate from the HSRP group address. VRRP lets you share the Master's interface IP address.
On Cisco devices, VRRP is configured to preempt by default, whereas HSRP is not configured to preempt by default.
On Cisco devices, HSRP sends hellos every 3 seconds and has a dead timer of 10 seconds. VRRP sends advertisements every 1 second and has a dead timer of roughly three times the advertisement interval.
VRRP can be configured to learn the timer configuration from the Master.

cisco - When *not* to create a SVI for a L2 VLAN?,"
You might not want to make a L2 SVI if you use VTP pruning. If pruning is on, an unused VLAN will be pruned from the trunk, resulting in less unnecessary broadcast/flooding traffic. However, creating an SVI, creates an ""active"" interface on your switch. A quick check in GNS3 gives the following:
R1#show vlan-switch

What are the best Cisco 6500 Ethernet modules for iSCSI?,"
Answering some of the generic questions:
Are Jumbo Frames an unquestionable requirement?
For FCoE it's somewhat irrelevant, as the FCoE frames are handled differently, their own default MTU is 2148 (frame size). You can do larger, but as with jumbo frames in general there's minimal benefit. An FCoE capable switch will just handle this.
Is it better for these modules to sit in the aggregation layer or access layer in case there's a future need to tie them together (as we have an L2 access layer not directly tied to one another with L2 adjacencies between pairs of access switches that traverse the agg switches).
Access really is the main place to use FCoE, replacing HBA's and edge FC switches with CNA's and 10g ""converged ethernet"" switches. Replacing distribution and core with FCoE can make sense when bandwidth needs justify it (or new build that has to run FC).
This is probably your sticking point actually, if you're not doing 10g to the machine you're almost certainly going to be very underwhelmed with the performance you'll get.
(Extra credit) Is FCoE the better choice over iSCSI?
Depends on what you're doing, almost certainly not, and there may be better options than either.
At a previous job we had a nice design using NFS (storage was NetApp's) where OS volumes were stored on a shared volume between the VM hosts (as normal), but data was individual NFS volumes, shared or separate as appropriate for the host, worked well in our environment as it was one group of admins managing ops from the app down to the hardware (well, its config, rack-n-stack, swaps, etc. was smarthands). Combined with NetApp's snapshots & snapmirror this made backup and restores trivial.

Cisco 1921 security features in the default bundle,"
The most basic license (read: cheapest) has only basic IP level functions.  It'll do NAT and you can setup ACLs (filters), but there's no ""firewall"" or ""IPS/IDS"" (intrusion detection.)  It this regard, it's the same as a $50 Linksys: you are ""protected"" by NAT. (which isn't real security)

How do the different types of materials used in Ethernet cables affect reliability?,"
metal
Aluminum is less expensive, but will develop cracks if it is flexed too many times. Copper is more expensive, but is more ductile; So it is much more forgiving of being repeatedly flexed.
specifications
The Cat-N specifications determine various limits; Parameters such as:

how much a signal may be attenuated per unit of distance
how much cross-talk (signal leaking from one pair to another) is allowed between the pairs
how much radiation (""leakage"" of the signals) is allowed from the cable
the range of frequencies which the cable's pairs are designed to carry

(and much, much more...)
use cases
There are differences in the insulation which jackets the conductors and the entire cable. For example, ""plenum"" cable -- meaning it is designed to be used in a plenum, a space within a building which is part of the air handling path for climate control -- is designed to limit how much, and at what temperature, it will emit toxic fumes.
There are options such as full length shielding (grounding) which prevents interference from other sources. (This is not common with Ethernet cables.)
The overall physical diameter of the cable may be a use case limiting factor. If you are install a very large number of cables, that might matter.
Some cables contain a ""strain relief"" feature; A small nylon string (looks like dental floss) can be added within the cable to help prevent stretching the conductors when cables are pulled into place.

Why has a fiber optic cable stopped functioning on one of the allowable wavelength?,"
The short answer is that fiber cabling is cheap enough that it is not worth your time or effort to fix a damaged cable in many instances. If you have doubts about a cable, you should just replace it if possible.
In some cases, the fiber is not able to be easily replaced (eg, undersea cables). If, say, you have a long run between buildings, then you might be better off using a OTDR to locate a possible break, and fixing/splicing the cable at that point.
Basically, you have to decide if the effort to fix the cable (if its possible) will be less than running an entire new cable. Most of the time, such as in DC or enterprise environments, it will probably be much cheaper/easier to run a new cable.
As for why the cable no longer works properly....there could be many reasons. Fiber cabling is much less robust than copper cabling. If the cladding or PVC jacket has been worn away, light may be leaking at that point, which may be interfering with the missing wavelength.
"
Routing traffic out different links from the same BGP AS,"
Is there a clear definition between site A and site B?
If so then I would look to define a policy on the edge routers to inject a community when receiving routes from the carrier MPLS.
Once this community has been put on the prefixes (say 100:1 for site A and 100:2 for site B) you could then add a policy to each of site A's routers to increase the LP for any routes with community 100:1 and likewise for site B with community 100:2.
This solution would match the requirement of only using BGP and also would be flexible enough to still allow B to use A's uplink if it lost its own uplink to the carrier.

juniper - SRX DHCP client compatibility with HP Procurve DHCP Relay,"
I opened a case with HP concerning this issue.  After escalating past the useless Level 1 tech, the Level 2 tech very alertly spotted something that I had not.
The SRX is sending its DHCPDISCOVER packet with a TTL of 1.  The Procurve's apparently will decrement the TTL and use the resulting TTL in the relay'ed packet to the DHCP server.  In this case, the decrement leaves the TTL at 0 meaning the packet gets dropped on the floor.
This is actually in spec for DHCP/BOOTP relay, though clearly it causes reduced interoperability.  I have asked HPNetworking to treat this as a bug/RFE and change the behavior.  No immediate response to that request in the case.
The SRX sending the DHCPDISCOVER with a TTL of 1 is also probably within spec, but, again, a choice of reduced interoperability, so I plan to open a case with JTAC on the same basis.
I'll add more info on the response of Juniper and HP as it becomes available.
Incidentally, I have tested the relay behavior of a Cisco 4506 (firmware version not immediately available), and a Brocade/Foundry FastIron Edge X (7.2 or 7.3 firmware, I believe, don't have immediate access to confirm) and they both handle relaying the request with TTL 1 without issue.
UPDATE
There is a way to change the TTL value that the SRX uses on its DHCP requests, but its not from within the JunOS cli...its done from the underlying Unix OS.
root@% sysctl -w net.inet.ip.mcast_ttl=64

I have opened an RFE with HP to make their relaying function more resilient, but not response from them yet on if/when that will be worked on.

wireless - where to find the complete 802.11i spec,"
As John already answered, 802.11i no longer exists as it has been superseded by a more recent standard, namely the 802.11-2007 standard.  For the 802.11 working group, you can always find the status of standards by looking here.
You really need to review the document and parts of 802.11i may be in several places.  From a very brief look at the table of contents, you may want to start with sections 5.4, 5.8 and 8.  You will need to key in on sections relating to PSK and CCMP specifically, as WPA2, Personal, and Enterprise are terminology coined by the Wifi Alliance, not the IEEE.
Even without reviewing the document, it is a fairly easy concept to understand the vulnerability.  Equate this to a file that is AES encrypted with a static password.  If someone were to get a copy of the file, all they needed to do to decrypt it would be to brute force decrypting the file until they found a password that produces meaningful output.  
If someone captures the connection handshake on a PSK network, this is exactly the same process.  This may not be quick and take lots of processing resources, it can be done.
As to what resources are necessary to perform such an attack, you may want to look into the BackTrack distribution.  This is a distribution targeted at security/penetration testing and there are several books and many documents describing how to use the tools within for all kinds of security applications.
Edit: I should have mentioned, while 802.11-2007 rolled up802.11i, the current standard is 802.11-2012 and this is a roll up of 802.11-2007 and and the amendments between.
"
ppp - Line Sync when there is supposed to be no ADSL codes on the line?,"
Gonna take a guess here that your in Australia.
The cutoff for getting a new ADSL connection from Telstra or any Telstra reseller is 56dB of attenuation at 300khz based on the calculated loss from the cabling records.
Your modem is reporting 63dB attenuation so chances are the calculated loss is higher than 56dB.
When you got ADSL in the first place the loss check must have been bypassed somehow or your cabling records were wrong and calculated at less than 56dB of loss.
Whatever the reason your cabling records now say you cant get ADSL and you have no existing ADSL service on the line.
Its not a technical limitation is a procedural/policy limitation.
You will probably need to go through a manger/escaltion/shouting match with management of your original provider to get the ADSL reinstated.

cisco - AP's at remote faciltiy will not join local controller,"
I cannot tell you exactly what is happening without looking at the configs of the Switches and the WLC you have as I can think of a number of possibilities. For me, it'd be helpful to have that information but more so, the things that you've done. Basically, what are the items you've tried thus far?
SW-A: 10.133.55.1 <---TRUNK---> SW-B: 10.133.55.2
WLC-4404 10.128.55.10
First thoughts though are as follows:
1.) Who is able to ping the WLC?
    a.) no one = check the interface on the switch and the WLC interface config, any firewalls
    b.) same subnet, 10.128.55.0/24, but no other subnets = check routing
    c.) all subnets on one switch but not from another switch = check trunk on SW-A & SW-B
2.) AP and WLC are able to ping each other but AP not showing up in WLC
    a.) check DHCP has the proper option 43 (Vendor Specific Info) set which tells the AP what IP the WLC is.
    b.) check any firewalls inbetween
    c.) create new interface on WLC with the same VLAN subnet as the AP and test
    d.) enable ssh on the AP and do a show log to see if anything peculiar sticks out
3.) You've checked all possibilities and as the config stands everything should work
    a.) reload the switches, AP's, WLC
    b.) pull out the configuration and put the configuration back in specific to the issue
    c.) try a different interface on the switch for the WLC
    d.) try a different interface on the WLC (maybe create a new one)
    e.) get on Cisco.com and use the bugtoolkit to see what bugs are out there for your particular WLC version. 
    f.) upgrade the WLC version a revision up and test.
I realize that some of my ideas are not really applicable, but I'm just throwing some ideas out there to maybe help give a new perspective on the problem. I've found just taking a break to think about something else and then coming back helps me.
"
VPN routing for hosts with multiple ip addresses,"
Routes are always chosen in order of specificity. Say a host has a route to 10.0.0.0/8 via router A and 10.0.1.0/24 via router B. As soon as it wants to send a packet to 10.0.1.1, it will prefer router B over router A. A default route is the least specific route you can have. Any other route you add will be preferred over a default route. So the answer is simple: add a specific route to the VPN DHCP pool via the Mikrotik router.
Don't forget to make the routes persistent, so they will survive a reboot. Asuming your DHCP pool is 10.0.1.0/24 and your Mikrotik has IP 1.1.1.1 and is connected on eth0, Here is the command for Windows:
route add -p 10.0.1.0 MASK 255.255.255.0 1.1.1.1

For Linux, a persistant route is added by editing the /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/route-eth0 file to define static routes for eth0 interface. 
GATEWAY0=1.1.1.1
NETMASK0=255.255.255.0 
ADDRESS0=10.0.1.0

"
How do you know if a Cisco switch is handling traffic well?,"
That depends on the switch model you have and it's not that easy.
Smaller Catalyst switches in general use at least two forms of buffer - there's usually a interface-lavel buffer, on the smaller Catalyst (2k/3k) visible in 'show buffers' under the section named 'Interface buffer pools:':
Interface buffer pools:
Syslog ED Pool buffers, 600 bytes (total 132, permanent 132):
   100 in free list (132 min, 132 max allowed)
   11151 hits, 0 misses
RxQ1 buffers, 2040 bytes (total 128, permanent 128):
   4 in free list (0 min, 128 max allowed)
   244594209 hits, 4559839 fallbacks
RxQ2 buffers, 2040 bytes (total 128, permanent 128):
   1 in free list (0 min, 128 max allowed)
   202559241 hits, 1582494 fallbacks, 0 trims, 0 created
   1582494 failures (0 no memory)
...

...and there's ""public"" area, where CPU is using the buffers as they're punted towards it and need servicing. The ""Rx""-level buffers are part of the shared buffer to service all interfaces (on either old, legacy switches like 2950 or newest 2960S/3560X/etc) or a subset of interfaces, belonging to specific port ASIC (like 2960 or 3560/3750/3560E/3750E).
On the 4500 and 6500 in particular it gets messy, as there is a number of pools that packet can go through - input interface (ASIC) buffer, the pool at linecard level (on the 6500 at DFC), at the switch-fabric level and at the end the buffer at Supervisor level. They don't have to be physically separate memory pools, but are often mapped in different commands to different names to ease the troubleshooting process (at which step of the packet walk-through was the packet dropped for example).
"
monitoring - Monitor specific traffic type on a Cisco router,"
You could monitor the traffic

on the router, Cisco IOS 12.4(20)T and later, there is a packet capture feature, with filtering on interface name and direction and ACL.

set up an access list for matching the traffic
create a capture buffer monitor capture buffer holdpackets filter access-list <number>
define a capture point monitor capture point ... possibly with interface name, direction, and more - use the inline help to see possibilities
let the traffic pass
look at the capture buffer: show monitor capture buffer holdpackets dump, use export instead of dump to get a PCAP file for Wireshark analysis
don't forget to stop capturing, remove the capture point and delete the capture buffer afterwards

For details and examples, follow the link or look at a Cisco troubleshooting manual.
on the switchport, where the router is connected to, for this you could set up a mirror port on the switch and monitor this via Wireshark
on the firewall, where the traffic passes
Cisco ASAs are capable of remotely doing packet capturing and giving you the output as a PCAP file which you can open locally with Wireshark. The ASDM provides an assistant for this. Step by step, you can specify source and destionation interface, ACLs or src/dest networks/host, and the protocol you like to watch. That's why I like having ASAs in place everywhere - with a router CLI may seem a bit complicated.


"
routing - Cisco: prevent vlan's of communicating with eachother on cisco router (ACL alternative),"
Fully agreed with Stefan. VRF is the way to go here. Quick example how to incorporate it to suggested config:
ip vrf VLAN1
  rd 42:1
ip vrf VLAN2
  rd 42:2
!
int vlan1
  ip vrf forwarding VLAN1
  ip address 1.1.1.1 255.255.255.0
int vlan2
  ip vrf forwading VLAN2
  ip address 2.2.2.2 255.255.255.0
!

Now vlan1 and vlan2 routing is separated.
To inspect routing tables, ping, traceroute you need to specify the vrf. e.g.:

ip route vrf VLAN1
traceroute vrf VLAN2 192.0.2.1
ping vrf VLAN2 192.0.2.1

Or same in new AFI aware, IPv6 supporting config:
vrf definition VLAN1
  rd 42:1
  address-family ipv4
vrf definition VLAN2
  rd 42:2
  address-family ipv4
!
int vlan1
  vrf definition VLAN1
  ip address 1.1.1.1 255.255.255.0
int vlan2
  vrf definition VLAN2
  ip address 2.2.2.2 255.255.255.0

"cisco - How to use ""Pattern Recall"" pattern matching in Regex","
There are a few things that make this fail:

This is trying to match the 0 five times. The first time you write the expression it matches, then it tries to match four more times,
This is matching 0 (with a trailing space) The last 0 won't have a trailing space,
This expression is incrementing the remembered pattern recall number, even though you only have one pattern,
The pattern recall only needs one backslash. \\1 would match the text ""\1"". The firstbackslash is the escape character, the character after that is the escaped character. 
Technically, with the trailing spaces, this would also match 10  0  0  0 but there is little chance of that being an output. There will never be a number beginning in 0 though.

So, to get the pattern you want, this will work:
#show interfaces stats  | i ( +0)\1\1\1

In this expression, you match any amount of spaces ending with a 0, repeated 3 additional times.
As a nice example of how pattern recall works. (+ 0)(+ 0)\1\2 works too. To make this more clear ( +0)( +1)\1\2\2 would match 0 1 0 1 1

Cisco Catalyst 4500E - modules installation,"
4500 line cards are hot swapable, so the answer to the first three questions is yes (assuming a 45xxR chassis).
A couple of caveats, for question 2, the supervisor has to meet the requirements for redundany.  For instance, you would not be able to insert a Sup7 in a chassis with a SupIV.  Additional configuration may be required as well to enable the redundancy properly.
For question 3, you shouldn't remove an active supervisor (while you can, this isn't best practice).  If the supervisor you wish to remove is currently active, failover to the standby supervisor first.
The answer to the last question is yes, you can cause damage to the chassis and/or line card if you insert them incorretly (i.e. this has nothing to do with the chassis being running, but a purely mechanical problem).  The levers should be open when inserted, the card should glide in easily until the levers start to close by themselves, and the final insertion should be done with the levers.  If you have to use A LOT of force, it may not be aligned properly and you could result in damage.
On the 4500s, you also need to make sure you are using the proper slots.  Do not try to install a supervisor module in a linecard slot or vice versa.

juniper - How to signal a VPLS multihoming change to a L2 CE device,"

Disable Portfast on the PE facing ports (On CE)
Enable RSTP across the CE network
Favor ""Blue link"" w/ interface cost

Working this out in my head I believe it should react as follows:
When blue link dies the CE will stop sending/receiving BPDUs from the blue interface. Default RSTP hello timer is 2 seconds. It waits for three missed hellos before calling that link ""dead"". Once three hellos (6 seconds) have been missed it will then re-establish the STP tree and age the MAC addresses.
This is basically option 1 you've stated above except the way I've read the comments and your original post it sounds like you want the PE to participate in STP. I'm suggesting allowing the customer to build its own tree between all CEs.
Your network should fail over smoothly, and the client network would follow suit a few seconds later.
This feels too simple to be the answer...but that's what I can see based on your write up.

bandwidth - Media Transfer rates......is using laser over fiber the fastest?,"

Adjusting the light frequency, theoretically will allow more data to transfer (i.e. UV -vs- IR) per unit time

No this is not true. Please see this question's answer on the Electronics Stack Exchange site. The frequency of the light travelling down the fibre is not relational to the speed of data transmitted as you may think. I know that question I linked is about copper but it might give you some insight. Single Mode fibre for example can run at 100Mbps, 1Gbps and 10Gbps; all at a wavelength of 1310nm. You need to look into symbol rate and encoding methods such as Manchester Encoding, 8b/10b encoding and 64b/66b encoding.

Would it be theoretically possible to use something like radio wave frequency (say GHz RF) transmitted over copper wire to increase bandwidth between two points?

No, this is not true. The speed at which data travels down a copper cable is nearly as fast as a fibre (circa 0.6*c). The electromagnetic wave is propagating around the edge of the copper cable at a rate called the dielectric constant, which is based upon the relationship between the transmission medium (the copper) and the air and plastic coating around it. See the answer to this different question on the Electronics Stack Exchange.
Note:
As you delve deeper into the physics of electronics and light, they behave completely counter intuitively.

Cisco config example for Policy Based Routing,"
I would recommend using a route-map for only one purpose (one for nat, another to pbr); mixed use can make for a mess.  For NAT, the match interface will apply post-routing -- handy to make conditional nat entries.
The route-map for PBR should use an ACL to match the traffic coming from LAN2 and then set the next-hop to the desired interface with set interface not set default -- or set ip next-hop dynamic dhcp as you won't know the actual gw address.  This bypasses / overrides any routing logic that would otherwise send then traffic to your expensive WAN.
"
switch - Cisco SFP module: Determing Priority?,"
As already suggested by Stefan and Ricky, if your fiber ports are aggregated in an etherchannel, then you can safely remove any of the fibers and all the traffic will use the remaining fiber. In order to check if they are aggregated you can run show etherchannel summary and check the output lookinf or any PortChannel interface made of both fiber ports. 
Otherwise, if both fiber ports are not aggregated and STP or RSTP is in use, then you need make sure you are pulling off the fiber connected to the blocking port. Run show spanning-tree <interface_name> for both fiber ports in both switches and look for the ports in status blocking. 
Just be careful if running PVST, RPVST or MST. Port costs could have been tuned in such way that one port is forwarding some VLANs and the other port is forwarding some other VLANs. In this case, whatever the fiber you pull off you will generate impact on your network.

"
cisco - Management network. Best practises: big VLAN or routed interfaces,"
As you said, it matters on how many devices we're talking about, but aside from that, what you should avoid if at all possible is only having ""in-band"" management of your devices. You don't want to have your management traffic riding the same network as your production traffic. If not all of your switches have a separate Ethernet interface for management, that's fine, but nearly every single piece of equipment out there has some form of serial console. USE IT. Especially as a backup for in-band management. This will save your ass if a device falls off of the planet. I'm also suggesting using a completely separate physical infrastructure for management connectivity to your equipment. This applies doubly for serial console access. If you're using one of your interfaces on your switches (that's not a dedicated management interface), that's also not as big of a deal, as long as you've got a separate network to connect it to.
50 devices isn't too unreasonable of a footprint to use a single VLAN (again, assuming you are not doing in-band management) and have one broadcast domain for - you may be trying to optimize too early at this stage. If your core switches are modular boxes then they should most definitely have Ethernet management interfaces - I would advise you to use those rather than an SVI or a physical routed interface.
edit: my personal preferences basically outline what I've advised above: always serial consoles. Use dedicated Ethernet management interfaces where applicable. If dedicated Ethernet management interfaces are not available, then burn a physical port on the box, but always always always a separate network, for serial consoles at the absolute minimum.
"
cisco - Enabling MLS QoS on a production 7600,"
You definitely should enable MLS QoS. It is also prerequisite for CoPP, which you should add in your TODO list to implement.
Enabling 'mls qos' without other config is extremely bad idea in low-end cats, like 3560/3750, due to unexpected default scheduling and due to heavily reduced buffers causing more microbursting.
On 7600/6500 it's comparatively safe to enable, but of course you can crash your router with 'show run'. I would feel comfortable enough to enable it during production hours.
You should monitor 'show queueing interface X' after enabling to see that you're not dropping anything. Long term, you should design QoS policy and implement it, I recommend using as few queues as possible (and assign 100% of buffer to those few queues).
Example of possible QoS policy in WS-X6704-10GE:
interface TenGigabitEthernet4/1
 wrr-queue bandwidth percent 30 40 30 0 0 0 0  ## allocate 3 queues (+implied strictpriority) share buffer 30% 40% 30% on thos three queues
 wrr-queue cos-map 1 1 0 7 # map cos values to queues
 wrr-queue cos-map 2 2 3 
 wrr-queue cos-map 3 1 4 
 wrr-queue cos-map 3 2 6 

For advanced config, you may want to supplement that with 'wrr-queue random-detect' with RED curve per queue+threshold.

If you don't have 512 VRFs, you can free up this internal VLAN without removing VRF by making sure VPN-CAM is activated. This may not be the simplest task as there are various reasons which mean VPN-CAM is disabled, most common reasons are:

You use 'class-default' in QoS, match 'any any' ACL instead
You use egress ACL in VRF, remove them

Once there are no reason to disable VPN-CAM, it gets renabled, and those VRF VLANs will disappear. This will also double your VRF performance, as you won't need to recirculate the packet in the PFC. 
Without VPN-CAM your first PFC lookup will resolve VRF, second will resolve egress rewrite. With VPN-CAM before packet even hits PFC, VPN-CAM has already told you which table to look against, so PFC will directly return egress rewrite on single lookup.
To confirm if VPN-CAM is used or not, you can issue this command:

remote command switch sh mls vpn-cam 0 511

Long term, maybe change the allocation order, to order from 4k downwards, instead of 1k upwards.

Cisco Nxus 5000 grounding - Ntwork Enginring Stack Exchang,"
If you ask any responsible electrician all devices must be grounded so that if there is short-circuit they don't become dangerous.
In practice I very very rarely see devices grounded, only incumbents with long history of spending lot of money and manpower have the professionalism to do this.
For legal reasons, I cannot recommend not grounding them, but I would expect exactly 0 problems, and you certainly wouldn't be alone running your boxes without ground.
If you are running AC PSU and you have Schuko plugs the system probably is already grounded.
"
cisco - Should portfast be used on a port potentially connecting to an unmanaged switch?,"
You should run 'port-fast' (in standard terms edge port) in every port not part of your switch core. Even if it is switch.
You should NOT have L2 loop through customer switches.
You should run BPDUGuard and BUM policers all interfaces, customer facing interfaces should be 1/5th or less of core facing limits. Unfortunately limiting unknown unicast often is not supported.
Why running 'port-fast' or edge is crucial is performance of RSTP (and by extension MST) rely on it. How RSTP works is it asks downstream if it can go to forwarding mode, and downstream asks its downstreams until there are no more ports to ask frmo, then the permission propagates back up.
Port-fast or edge port is implicit permission from RSTP point-of-view, if you remove this implicit permission, explicit permission must be gotten otherwise it'll fall back to classic STP timers. Which means even one non-portfast port will kill your subsecond RSTP converge.

cisco catalyst - Switch interface config for IP Phones,"
The first method also works for Avaya phones - only they must have the proper DHCP option strings on the data vlan to know which voice vlan it should try and tag its traffic to afterwards.
I usually add #sw host
(which adds spanning-tree portfast and sw mode access automatically when configuring ports)
Portfast allows the port to go directly into forwarding state when the interface is up - otherwise you're going to be waiting 45 seconds per port!
"
ospf - Remote Campus Routing Design,"
A tunnel is your only way out here, unfortunately. Without using a tunnel a packet would enter the service providers network and if that destination isn't already known it will get thrown down the black hole.
I would hope and assume that the provider isn't doing any special policing on tunneled traffic, but you'll have to test that out for yourself. If you're worried about moving DSCP values between the original packet and the tunnel packet that is easy enough to accomplish. So voice traffic can still pass through the SP network with EF.
In all honestly some sort of common peering here would be the best. Even if you peer with RIP, redistribution is easy enough and would accomplish your goals. I'm not sure why you can't apply filtering to incoming routes except perhaps company policy?

Routes disappearing from OSPF routing table,"
For cisco routers, there's a KB article about it:
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk365technologies_tech_note09186a008009481a.shtml
From the article:

A common problem when using Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is routes in the 
  database don't appear in the routing table. In most cases OSPF finds a 
  discrepancy in the database so it doesn't install the route in the routing
  table. Often, you can see the Adv Router is not-reachable message (which means
  that the router advertising the LSA is not reachable through OSPF) on top of
  the link-state advertisement (LSA) in the database when this problem occurs.

So I guess that the issue has to do with the advertising router becoming unreachable periodically, but the question has too little info to make a guess about the root cause...
"
How can I speed up CLI typing in Cisco IOS using shortcuts?,"
We can use the alias  command in global conf mode:
alias <mode> <command-alias> <original-command>

<mode> is one of the many IOS command modes. If you need it in different modes, you have to call it for each one - type alias ? to get a long list of modes.
An example for checking for a dhcp snooped IP, type in global conf mode
alias exec snoop show ip dhcp snooping binding | include

Now you can simply type snoop 172.16.20.12 to check for this IP or snoop 801 for checking all IPs in VLAN 801, for example. Do similarly for show mac-address-table | include and you're faster in searching and troubleshooting.
Further tipps:

document your aliases for you and for your collegues
sh aliases shows your aliases plus the predefined ones
while no alias <mode> <command> can be guessed for removing an alias, no alias <mode> deletes the aliases for a complete mode - so you can clear several at once, default alias <mode> works similarly, as expected
if you decide to use aliases, deploy them once everywhere you may need them
tools like Cisco Prime can help in deploying
don't forget the original commands ;-)

"
"wan - What are leased lines, serial lines and dedicated lines?","
The terms do get thrown about quite a bit and the definition is a bit of a murky issue as they can be used in several ways.
I would say that generally a leased line is a line you are paying someone else for use.  For instance, you can string your own copper and establish your own T1/T3 service between buildings.  However, you could also pay someone to provide and maintain that line.  Often leased lines have a SLA associated with them.
A dedicated line would be a line that is dedicated to you/your company.  For instance, in an office building, you may not have a dedicated line.  You may have a PRI that comes into the building and provides service to multiple organizations.  Often this is cheaper because the telecommunications company doesn't need as many lines going into the building and has fewer to maintain.
"
ieee 802.11 - Is a wireless only network (for end users) a viable option?,"
With the arrival of 802.11n and with 802.11ac almost here, this can be a viable option.  However the expectation of cost savings may not be accurate as you may have additional initial costs (for instance hiring a wireless consultant to make sure things go right) or even in ongoing costs (do you need new staff?).  You will carefully have to consider your path forward and how this impacts your users and IT staff.
That being said, there are a number of things to keep in mind when considering not deploying a traditional 802.3 Ethernet network (the larger the wireless network and number of client devices, the more these are true):

802.11 is somewhat still in the same place where 802.3 was in it's infancy.  There are device inter-operability issues that exist based on the way that some vendors implement the standards. Your IT staff may need to spend additional time testing new hardware or software.
802.11 is newer, more complicated, and changing much faster than 802.3, so the development and quality assurance processes by wireless vendors (infrastructure and client devices) is not always what it should be.
You will want to make sure that you properly plan the wireless deployment considering a number of factors including at least both coverage and capacity planning.
802.11 can be more difficult to configure, optimize, and maintain properly than a traditional 802.3 network.  Having someone on staff or hiring a consultant who are well versed in 802.11 and RF will be very helpful.
Wireless is not as reliable as wired since it is more easily subject to outside sources of interference.
If you haven't already, you would want to invest in some tools to help your IT staf maintain and troubleshoot the wireless network, including at least a basic 2.4GHz/5GHz spectrum analyser and a wireless capture device (without special hardware/drivers, Windows cannot capture wireless traffic properly; Linux can with the right hardware).
Problems in 802.11 can be more difficult to troubleshoot, so problem resolution can take longer at times.
There may be additional security concerns and costs with an 802.11 network.  At the very least you will want to consider running WPA2-Enterprise security if you don't have it already.  VPN for wireless clients is also an option (with or without WPA2).

I can probably go on, but I hope I have illustrated that while this is a viable option, you need to make sure you understand what this change entails if you wish to do it successfully.

cisco asa - ASA5510 Site-to-site VPN with Bluecoat SSG proxy,"
You will have to redesign a bit of your network to solve this.
Here's the network as I see it:
LAN-BlueCoat-ASA --> VPN --> SRP.
You can transport all traffic from spokes to the ASA, then to Internet, but your proxy is behind ASA so I don't see how the traffic can reach it.
One desperate solution, would be to move the proxy in front of the ASA, but for many reasons I don't recommend it.
This being said, I can think of two ways of doing it:
 - use an explicit proxy to all the remote sites (the bluecoat IP), so everyone will send any WEB request through the tunnel straight to the appliance
 - replace ASA with a VPN&UTM equipment like Fortinet, SRX, UTM-1...

cisco ios 12 - SNMP ENGINE process has high CPU usage on a few 6500 chassis,"
I would take a look at this support document from Cisco.
In part it recommends to run the following command to see which OID's were recently polled:
show snmp stats oid

This gives a readout for which OID's you are polling.  It will allow you to see, by judging the time stamps, which OID is taking a long time to poll.  This is usually where your problem lies.  See the below sample output:
asr1001-1#show snmp stats oid

time-stamp               #of times requested             OID

20:31:33 EDT May 25 2013         1142                    ifOutErrors
20:31:33 EDT May 25 2013         1142                    ifInDiscards
20:31:33 EDT May 25 2013         1142                    ifInErrors

20:31:33 EDT May 25 2013         1902                    ifHCInOctets

However do note that it was only added in IOS release 12.4(20)T and 12.0(22)S, so may not be available to you.

In the linked document there are some other methods such as:

They aren't as nice and neat as the show snmp stats oid but they can help you out if that command isn't available.

Can FlexConnect ACLs be combined with Local mode ACLs on the same Cisco WLC WLAN?,"
I don't have anything on 7.2 still so I can't give you a definitive answer on your question. However, what I can say is that if you take the letter of the documentation as law and presume that you cannot combine FlexConnect and Local ACLs on a single WLAN, and you really don't want to create multiple WLANs, what I know you can do is use central switching on FlexConnect APs to apply local ACLs.
We actually do this for our Web Authenticated guest network. Yes, traffic on this network must transit back to the location of the WLC, but it was the best solution for us at the time of implementation.

cisco catalyst - 3750G Switch Buffer Monitoring,"
As far as I know data you want is not available on SNMP.

  output queues dropped: 
queue: threshold1 threshold2 threshold3
-----------------------------------------
 queue 0:            0            0            0 
 queue 1:       100989            0            0 
 queue 2:            0            0            0 
 queue 3:            0            0            0 
...

What you'd like to know is ifIndex, queue, threshold and drop counter. I'm not aware of populated MIB/OID where these values can be polled from.
Like John Jensen explained, outDiscard is only thing you can get, but it aggregates all of this, so you won't know if it's BE, AF, EF, NC or what, which is dropping. You probably wouldn't care about BE drops, but you'd care about EF drops.
There are two OIDs where these aggregate egress drops are stored, if your ifIndex is 10001, you'd find them here (symbolic and numeric presentation):
IF-MIB::ifOutDiscards.10001
.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.19.10001
EtherLike-MIB::dot3StatsDeferredTransmissions.10001
.1.3.6.1.2.1.10.7.2.1.7.10001

3750/3560 are not very good switches for application which can microburst, i.e. if your egress is 1GE and ingresses are 1GE too, two very low average rate ingress ports can easily congest the egress port, causing drops. To maximize the available buffers (and minimize microburst drops) follow this document.
"
ipv4 - Difference between Subnet and VLAN?,"
If they are used interchangeably then they are used incorrectly.
Subnet refers to particular IP network, such as 192.0.2.0/28.  
VLAN refers to 802.1Q standard, in which you can essentially give each port unique MAC address table, effectively separating them from each other.
VLAN may transport one or more subnet (but does not have to, it may be transporting something else than IP entirely). 
Subnet may be configured for VLAN, but does not have to be, it could be without 802.1Q or over some completely different L2 technology than ethernet.

security - How can I use SSL remote access VPN for connecting two sites?,"
You can do this in theory, but you will need a good client machine to do that and by good, I mean a good Windows installation.
This is because the operating system on the machine you want to use SSL VPN client will have to deal with all the traffic, and that machine will have to somehow prove router&firewall capabilities.
Step 1: you connect that machine (from remote office) to the headquarter. You will receive an IP address from the SSL_VPN_pool.
Step 2: you will add a static (persistent route) on all stations (from the remote office), that for the HQ destination would have to reach through the machine connected at Step 1.
Step 3: you will have to enable Routing&Remote Service on the machine you use SSL VPN client (I assume you will use a Windows platform, although Linux will work better for this), so that traffic from that location will be routed from lan interface to the VPN_interface. Here is a catch: you will either NAT this traffic with a source of your SSL_IP_pool or you can let it this way.
Step 4: if you don't NAT you have to add on Fortigate static routes for the remote office network and also firewall rule on the ssl.root interface-->to-->HQ_internal.
You can do this, but that extra_vpn_equipment_money you don't want to spend would be NAT-ed into some workstation_configuration_sweat.
"
"Why doesn't my port-channel interface come up, between Cisco Catalyst switches?","
Improperly configured EtherChannel (port-channel) interfaces would be disabled automatically, to prevent problems such as loops. First of all, having the same configuration on each side would be the safest.
Here's a checklist:

Both switches must see the ports as an EtherChannel bundle. If one switch would consider ports as separate connections, it's inconsistent and would fail.
All ports in the bundle needs to have the same EtherChannel protocol, i.e. don't mix PAgP and LACP. Also manual configuration mixed with one protocol is not recommended.
All channel ports must use at the same speed and the same duplex mode. And LACP doesn't support half-duplex.
No one of the ports can be SPAN (switched port analyzer) destination port.
If the channel is layer 3, give the address to the port-channel interface, not to single ports.
For layer 2 channels:

All ports have to be either trunks or in the same VLAN.
If trunking is used, the mode has to be the same on all ports.
If you use a trunk with an allowed VLAN range, that range must be the same on all ports.
If you would have different STP costs in a channel, at least ports have to be compatible to each other. STP considers an EtherChannel as a single port.
Protocol filtering has to be the same on all ports.
Also here, (static MAC) addresses must be on the port-channel interface, not on single ports.

bgp - Route servers and looking glasses,"
(Note that these two terms are often used interchangeably, which can lead to some confusion.)
Looking Glasses
A looking glass is usually a website (most often CGI) that interfaces with routers that are owned and operated by a single ISP or other network operator. Most of the time these are publicly accessible, but there may be instances where they're not. The looking glass provides a view (in website form) into a BGP table of a particular router in an operator's network. Often, looking glass implementations will also include other utilities, such as the ability to run a traceroute to a destination as if it were run from the network operator's router itself. Looking glasses are useful because they provide a perspective into an upstream's BGP table. Level3, a well-known tier one carrier in the U.S. has a looking glass available here. These are widely used troubleshooting tools.
Route Servers
The term ""route server"" has evolved to mean two different things, both of which will be explained. I'm defining two route server ""subtypes"" here that should make the distinction more clear. These definitions are my own and are only used to try to dispel any possible confusion. In reality, the public route server is also commonly referred to as a ""route collector"" or a ""route-views server"" (the latter originating from the University of Oregon Route Views Project).
Public Route Server
These are systems (usually routers, but some exist that run open source routing daemons) that are publicly accessible, often via Telnet, and one is able to also run pings, traceroutes, and ""show ip bgp"" (there are also a couple Juniper route servers out there, don't worry!) commands. The difference between a public route server and a looking glass (aside from an LG having a nifty CGI) is that a wide variety of networks (including some tier one carriers) peer with a route server, so there's an ""overall"" bigger picture of which prefixes are coming from which ASN's. Command authorization policy will vary from route server to route server. Here's a list of IPv4 route servers. They have a separate page with IPv6 route servers as well. When it comes to differentiating looking glass from route server, one can think of the looking glass as a frontend to a route server, whether the route server itself be publicly or privately accessible.
Can't you run a looking glass on a public route server?
You can, but typically the people that run looking glasses are the ones that can afford to operate and maintain the servers that the looking glasses run on. With a public route server, all you need is a router (or a server running an open source routing daemon), a good AAA policy, and some folks that are willing to give you BGP feeds. It's also relevant to note that some network operators also host publicly accessible route servers, and you might even come across some operators that run a route server in addition to a looking glass.
IXP Route Server
This version of the route server is a little bit different. On shared peering fabrics at IXP's, the barrier of entry for an organization to begin peering is lower. You have a single port (that the IXP sells to you) connected to the IXP peering LAN, and you're given an IP address by the IXP. Now you can peer with anyone else on the fabric; contrast this with a PNI, which involves a separate dedicated physical connection between you and another entity. With a connection to an IXP's peering LAN, aside from your single port being the bottleneck, you have to manually configure eBGP sessions with whomever you wish to peer with. This is called bilateral interconnection - there is one session between you and the peer, and only you and the peer exchange announcements. If the IXP has many members, this can become cumbersome. In this case, a route server is typically deployed at the IXP in order to be the ""one stop shop"" for an organization to set up an eBGP session with in order to receive prefixes from whomever else is peered with the route server. This is called multilateral interconnection. One BGP session between you and the route server, and you get everyone else's announcements that also peers with the route server.
Some organizations will rely on the route server eBGP session(s), while others will use it as a backup to their existing eBGP peerings on the IXP fabric. Most IXP's will have redundant route servers and suggest that organizations peer with both if they peer with the route servers at all.
What about BGP?
Multilateral peering using route servers brings interesting challenges in regards to BGP. A route server itself is an eBGP speaker, however there have to be specific considerations for a route server and multilateral BGP peering. Some of these rules will be reminisce of iBGP route reflection, and there are indeed many similarities. There has been recent work to standardize behaviors of a route server when it comes to these specific features. The following caveats are worth noting here:

NEXT_HOP Attribute - This attribute must be passed on unmodified between the route server and its clients. While the route server implementation itself will not modify this attribute, it's still best practice to set ""next-hop-self"" on eBGP sessions from your router to a route server.
AS_PATH Attribute - Again, because the route server is intended to be transparent and not participate in any routing decisions, and modification of this attribute may affect the route server clients' best path decision making process, the route server implementation must not modify this attribute. In addition, the route server will not send their own ASN in BGP updates to its clients, therefore it's required to set ""no bgp enforce-first-as"" (Cisco-specific) on the client router in order to allow the eBGP session to form between the client and the route server.
MULTI_EXIT_DISC Attribute - MED is another attribute that should be propagated to route server clients without modification by the route server, since it can also used to influence the best path selection process.
Communities Attributes - These should not be modified by the route server, unless the community (or communities) is intended for processing by the route server itself. Typically communities are used by IXP route server implementations to allow the peers of the route server to manipulate routing updates to other route server peers.

It is important to remember two distinctions in regards to IXP route server implementation:

The route server does not participate in any routing or forwarding. It is supposed to be as transparent as possible.
Route server clients depend on the route server to perform their outbound filtering for them.

IXP Route Server Implementation Options
Typically IXP operators will deploy open source routing daemons as route servers. There are three popular options:

Quagga, specifically bgpd. Runs on Linux and BSD. It's been around the longest and probably has the most information available. There have been multiple forks of Quagga over the years, including a train with sponsored development by EuroIX, a train developed by the Open Source Routing group (which more aims to improve IGP functionality with OSPF and ISIS), and the Quagga-RE (Release Engineering) train which has experimental features. Google has also created their own fork of Quagga. Quagga bgpd supports both IPv6 and IPv4, however most IXP operators (and even some Quagga maintainers) will advise against using the ""mainline"" Quagga train for operating a route server at an IXP.

BIRD. Runs on Linux and BSD. BIRD has gained quite a bit of popularity due to its stability and powerful filtering language and capabilities, in addition to its very good scheduling system. There have been a couple of published comparisons and scale tests between Quagga and BIRD. Overall, BIRD tends to be more stable and isn't as susceptible to CPU and memory churn as Quagga is. Both BIRD and Quagga are single-threaded however, but this is intentional. In addition, although BIRD supports both IPv4 and IPv6, it requires two different processes (compiled binaries) for IPv4 and IPv6.

OpenBGPD. Runs on Linux and BSD. OpenBGPD is the only multi-threaded open source BGP daemon available. It's known to be fairly stable under load however TCP MD5 support is somewhat poor.


In addition to open source daemons, Cisco also offers a route server implementation for IOS-XE, which runs on the ASR platform. At the time of this writing, Juniper doesn't offer a route server implementation on their hardware or operating system, but this may change in the future.
In terms of evaluating an open source routing daemon, in regards to memory handling and architecture, one can safely assume that BIRD > OpenBGPD > Quagga, however the ASR platform and IOS-XE is also reportedly much more capable at scale when compared to the open source daemon options available.
I hope this sheds some light on route servers/looking glasses in general.

security - Source of Cisco NBAR dropped traffic,"
Depending on which platform your using you can use NetFlow data to see this. Most Cisco routing platforms support this and even newer switching platforms support this as well.
Also simply logging the ACL (Adding log to the end of the ACL statement) will generate a log message that states the source of the packets that were denied.
"
vpn - What are the downsides of OpenVPN?,"
IMHO, the biggest disadvantage to OpenVPN is that it's not interoperable with the vast majority of products from ""big name"" network vendors out there.  Cisco & Juniper's security and router products don't support it - they only support IPsec and proprietary SSL VPNs.  Palo Alto, Fortinet, Check Point, etc. don't support it, either.  So, if your organization / enterprise wants to setup a site-to-site extranet VPN to another company and you've only got an OpenVPN appliance, you're probably going to be out of luck.
That being said, some network hardware & software companies are starting to embrace OpenVPN.  MikroTik is one of them.  It's been supported since RouterOS 3.x:
http://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/OpenVPN
Also, for the longest time the only way to run an OpenVPN client on Apple's iOS required jailbreaking.  This is not so, anymore:
https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/openvpn-connect/id590379981?mt=8
Overall, the situation is improving.  However, without vendors like Cisco & Juniper implementing it in their products, I can't see large enterprises adopting it without facing interoperability problems.

ipv6 - Best practice for dual-homing site with two ISPs?,"
What kind of equipment do you have connecting to the providers? If it is a Cisco device you could use IP SLA to ping a destination like 8.8.8.8 over the primary ISP. As soon as you don't get a reply failover to the other static route. Example config:
! ISP1
ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 x.x.x.x track 1
! ISP2
ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 y.y.y.y 250
ip sla 1
icmp-echo 8.8.8.8 source-interface <ISP1_interface>
frequency 3
timeout 1000
ip sla schedule 1 life forever start-time now

You may have to put a static route for 8.8.8.8 over ISP1 to make it always exit out that path. Obviously if you really use 8.8.8.8 choose another IP because otherwise you won't have reachability to it if ISP1 goes down.
!x.x.x.x is next-hop to ISP1
ip route 8.8.8.8 255.255.255.255 x.x.x.x

The ability to manage centrally while still having ""line cards"" distributed throughout the DC is the real reason to use a FEX. Drastically reducing cabling is valuable to anyone, technical or not, and the argument of being able to manage the entire infrastructure at fewer points is time savings, pure and simple.
One of your big doubts is that you're worried about single points of failure. All devices have the ability to be dual-homed, and in certain configurations, you can even establish virtual port channels with the Nexus 2K FEXs themselves. 
Take a look at Cisco's documentation. You'll find that you can design a topology that is just as redundant as the ""direct-cable"" option you're considering, with less fuss.

Advantages to BGP peering over VPN,"
This kind of trick was used by certain ISP's abusing peering relationships - provider A peers at two points (let's say east and west coast of the US).  Provider A builds a tunnel between his peering nodes across B's network and B is suddenly unwillingly providing free cross-country bandwidth.  Needless to say, this kind of behavior was (and is) highly frowned upon.
Now - as to the use of BGP over VPN tunnels for transit/end users there are a couple of problems:
1.)  The routing of the underlying tunnels is completely opaque.  Assuming you have two tunnels to two different providers it is possible (...if not likely in the case of consumer grade service) that these tunnels could traverse some of the same intermediate points, which kind of defeats the purpose if HA is the goal in mind.
2.) Supply and demand - Sure, ISP's could offer these kinds of services but realistically who is buying them?  If you're at a point where you've secured an ASN and have either gotten PI space (unlikely) or negotiated appropriate route leaking, chances are that you're spending a fair amount on transit service (at a minimum).  In contrast, consumers spending $59 USD a month for Internet service aren't likely to provide the revenue to (profitably) offset not only the cost of the hardware to land tons of BGP sessions but also the operational overhead of maintaining and supporting said sessions.  There's also a hidden cost in terms of the backhaul of traffic that's even less likely for ISP's to want to pay for.

cisco - Can netflow be left on all the time?,"
The new Cisco product line does netflow in hardware (and I believe the previous generation as well), but when I approach this question here are the things I typically ask myself:

1: Can I afford the bandwidth (i'm sure this won't be a problem most of the time)
2: Is netflow done in hardware on this device?
3: Can I afford the CPU cycles (if applicable)
4: how long you want to store said data on the device
5: how long should the data be stored on the aggregation point

I have only found benefits when leaving it on all the time, but I also keep an eye on how it's affecting the performance of my network.
To each his own!

design - Improving Network Flow Documentation in 3G->4G upgrade project,"
I have been doing some research and prototyping on this now and found out here that this is something that I can share with you all as a reference if you also ever find this problem at your door step. I still welcome any advice or approaches that worked for you!
First of in order to maintain a reusable set of devices that are used over and over in the flows I got the immediate realisation that I did not want to copy and paste the Visio stencil object over and over and over again. Besides, I found another problem - I could not find the number of documents (configurations/deployments) that this device was used in without resulting to some sickening VB for Applications inside Visio or having a companion Excel/Access list of connections.
I really do not know if this is ever an issue for others but for an upgrade project it seems you can never underestimate where your device may be included in a flow. These changes have to strictly documented for all to see, not hidden in the ITSM (ITIL) Change Management tool! Especially as we do not have a front-end to this database to make meaningful investigations!
Being of UML decent, I have chosen to use a model repository to achieve this quest of sanity with our infrastructure and network documentation.
First, I have created a set of classes that represent every equipment involved in the documentation of our High Level Design (HLD) and Low Level Design(LLD). To me, this means that all engineers in the company have now a template of every asset we have on our network! 
All changes documented with this model-driven approach enables us to can carry out the impact analysis, instantly!

The single Model, has


93 main devices, includes 


WEB application servers, 
GPRS and Mobile Internet Service appliances
DNS/Mail Relay servers
Routers
MPLS Routers
Proxies
Check Point Firewalls
Juniper Netscreen Firewalls
Intelligent Networks (IN) appliances
AAA/LDAP
Billing and Mediation appliance
Charging Gateway appliance




  

The above were (re)used across the first set of 432 3G flows-paths (Stored in separate operation-specific model repository) where the devices are instantiated 168 times saving me all the Copy-Pasting and bringing me automatic dependency and usage analysis




358+ VLANs/VRFS have been documented and can be easily applied to any network infra in the model

All this in 14 days working 12 hour shifts!
May be in future we should be able to integrate this model repository to asset databases like the Configuration Management Database. If anyone has ideas of something already done I would like to know. If you also managed to solve it differently and can reveal a glimpse please do. 
Since the 93 devices are nothing secret, I am going to put them on GitHub and allow those with a UML tool to extend this base so that we could possibly have all the device groups that exist in the IT eco-system; pipe dream :] 
It seems documentation is that most underdeveloped area in NE - my thesis is that if we had sufficient and valid documentation we could simulate a lot of the work we what to do without having to make the actual mistake, then ask how to fix it!
TODO: Add link to the GitHub repo...

monitoring - Network debugging,"
Because ping times are distinct, the problem should be between layer 1 and layer3.
the first step is to see if it is a layer1 issue. I would check the errors on the switch interfaces. If errors are appearing on the interfaces, I will try to change the cables or the interfaces on the switch to see if the problem is persistent for the same Linux devices.
If still persists, Linux servers should have the problem.
"
ethernet - Monitoring best practice for thresholding errors on an interface?,"
Ethernet standard officially allows 10^-12 bit-error-rate, while in practice the hardware meet much better BER than which standard demands.
You should also be able to bing for 'SQA' (Service Quality Assurance) or 'SLA' (Service Level Agreement), some companies publish them, you could use them to check what your competitors are offering and offer something to that level.
Our SQA states to customers that 0.02% is minor fault (we will fix if ticket is opened), which I think is quite large packet loss for fibre connection, but same SQA covers also DSL so we didn't want to be too aggressive with it. So far this has been sufficient to customers, but we are prepared to reduce the number if it is hurting sales.
There are several bingable tools online, where you can check how much packet loss hurts TCP, which can be useful information when deciding what is acceptable loss for your application/product:

"
Why does BGP RR only reflect the best path?,"
To conserve memory at destination, it was not important to micro-optimize forwarding path in the past. This is quote from RFC4456:

One of the key component of the route reflection approach in
addressing the scaling issue is that the RR summarizes routing
information and only reflects its best path.

While scaling is always important, clearly there are today scenarios where we'll rather spend RIB memory than choose suboptimal path.
To address this issue there is BGP AddPath and BGP optimal reflection. AddPath is available from both Cisco and Juniper, while optimal reflection currently is not implemented by major vendors.
AddPath allows BGP to send more than single best path. Optimal reflection will use SPF (ISIS, OSPF) to reflect best route from POV of receiver, not from route reflectors own point of view.
"
monitoring - Broader Impact of enabling “preserve source address” inside NLB,"
I'm not familiar with Netscaler, so take this with grain of salt.
I presume you are using NAT to translate source address of request today, so actual server is not seeing today real request address but some single NAT address translated by Netscaler.
I also presume that his toggle would remove that source address NAT, allowing your servers to see real request address.
There are some scenarios where one would want to NAT the request address, such as if for redundancy purposes you want to connect your server to two or more SLB devices simultaneously (who would ECMP the VIP, i.e. both SLB are hot:hot, but not connected to each other in anyway). Then when your server replies to a request, it needs to reply via same interface where the original query came in from.
On Linux machines you can fix this easily, without relying on natting the source at SLB.   
On Windows server, you wouldn't really have any way to return the request back to the SLB which sent it, unless you NAT each request. If SLB1 NATs source to 192.0.2.1 and SLB2 NATs source to 192.0.2.2, then it's just matter of setting static route in windows, 192.0.2.1/32 pointing to SLB1 and 192.0.2.2/32 pointing to SLB2. This way you are always returning packet back to the SLB which sent the request.

What do I need to do in order to enable remote HTTPS management of a SonicWall NSA3500,"
William,
If you have enabled HTTPS on the interface and still have the default allow any firewall rule for the HTTPS management service then remote management should be configured.
If you have enabled the SSLVPN you will probably have changed the management port to something else... generally 8443 but you can check this in the System -> Administration menu. you should see the port setting in the HTTPS administration port setting.
If its not working then check that you are trying to connect to the correct IP address. you need to connect to the interface IP address.
Also check the logs of the firewall after trying to login. If its being denied it should tell you and hopefully give a useful reason why. if you still have problems please port the logs and I will have a look.

cisco - QoS at the edge of branch,"
There is no way for receiver to affect scheduling of sender. You should just work on getting QoS configured at sender.

"
monitoring - What is the difference between netFlow and sFlow?,"
NetFlow is a protocol for exporting aggregated IP flow totals. As such it is well suited to IP traffic accounting on Internet routers. With Netflow V9 (AKA IPFIX it can look into Layer 2 traffic as well)
sFlow is a general purpose network traffic measurement system technology. sFlow is designed to be embedded in any network device and to provide continuous statistics on any  protocol (L2, L3, L4, and up to L7), so that all traffic throughout a network can be accurately characterized and monitored. These statistics are essential for congestion control, troubleshooting, security surveillance, network planning etc. They can also be used for IP accounting purposes.
Netflow mirrors all traffic, and places a load on the CPU when utilised.
SFlow is a packet sampling technology where the switch captures every 100th packet (configurable) per interface and sends it off to the collector. sFlow is built into the ASIC, and places minimal load on the CPU. 
Netflow supported by Cisco, Juniper, Alcatel Lucent, Huawei, Enterasys, Nortel, VMWare
sFlow supported by Alaxala, Alcatel Lucent, Allied Telesis, Arista Networks, Brocade, Cisco, Dell, D-Link, Enterasys, Extreme, Fortinet, Hewlett-Packard, Hitachi, Huawei, IBM, Juniper, LG-Ericsson, Mellanox, MRV, NEC, Netgear, Proxim Wireless, Quanta Computer, Vyatta, ZTE and ZyXEL (see sFlow link)

cisco catalyst - How do you convince management that 3560/3750s are a bad idea in your DC?,"
FWIW I've had experience with 3750's (3750G, and then later 3750E/3560E) at scale in a TOR setup; initially with L2 port-channels/GLBP (variants of 2x1G and 2x2G and the rare 2x4G for db racks) and then with L3 to the TOR (went with this for 3750E/3560E and 10G to the core). I'm talking thousands of them. We only saw issues with buffers for the most bandwidth intensive services, and at that point we were looking at 10G to the host anyway (and dense pizza boxes with 24-48 SFP+'s).
Whether or not you're going to be able to prove anything to management is really going to depend on the application and you doing your homework on what the requirements of your design and the application are, and knowing exactly what the specifications are of the application, as well as the expected growth velocity of it. Set up a design review with your management chain as well as the primary owners/customers of the network.
Management wants to see data, and if you don't have the resources to fully test the box (come up with a test plan, connect it up to some traffic generation hardware, fully scope it out and stress test it to the design spec, etc) this is going to be hard to do. They're not going to be impressed with anecdotal evidence, and finding this kind of hard data may prove difficult, since I'm sure that folks publishing this kind of thing would violate all kinds of NDA's.
Everyone else that's posted an answer to this has outlined the 3750 platform's ""problem areas"" pretty nicely: stacking and weird failure modes inherent to it, buffer sizes, etc. There's also this question that outlines the issues with gathering SNMP statistics on output queue drops - the buffers are shared across the ASICs, so any stats you get with this via SNMP are going to be the same for specific port ranges (this could be one sticking point you could bring up with your management chain).
To summarize, I'd say that the 3750/3560 would be ""fine"" for most deployments, even at somewhat large scales. Avoid stacking them if you can, but I'd say that it's not too horrible to do this in very small and manageable quantities.
"
Accidentally Removed Allowed VLANs from Cisco Switch Dot1Q Trunk,"
You need to use the following command to add your VLAN 30 to an existing Dot1Q trunk on a Cisco Catalyst switch:
switchport trunk allowed vlan add 30

Otherwise IOS just thinks you're trying to overwrite the existing configuration and you are left with an accidentally deleted set of allowed VLANs.
You could similarly use ""remove"" in place of ""add"" to remove only one VLAN.  See the entire syntax below.  (It is actually the same syntax in Cisco Nexus OS or IOS, FYI.)
SW-FOO(config-if)#switchport trunk allowed vlan ?
  WORD    VLAN IDs of the allowed VLANs when this port is in trunking mode
  add     add VLANs to the current list
  all     all VLANs
  except  all VLANs except the following
  none    no VLANs
  remove  remove VLANs from the current list


Another option is to put all of your allowed VLANs into the command, like so:
switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20,30

This option is more time consuming but also works.
"
GNS3: Local install vs Workbench,"
I'll go ahead and provide some more ""in-depth"" instructions on telling GNS3 to use a ""remote hypervisor"" (a dynamips instance listening on another machine).
You can even use this setup with Amazon EC2 (or another utility computing provider). A setup with a utility computing provider would also be extremely useful for testing out topologies with a very large number of routers, to see how OSPF may behave at scale, etc. I've documented how to do this at my last job (but this was before GNS3 was so popular) and we used it successfully for numerous scale tests. This would also be ideal for folks that don't want to spend the money on a high-end server but can afford to spend a few dollars for a few hours of ""server time"" for GNS3 labs, without chewing up CPU cycles on their home machines.
The following instructions assume your remote hypervisor is running Linux.
Step One: Set up your Linux box.
jjensen@jjensen-dev:~$ mkdir dynamips
jjensen@jjensen-dev:~$ cd dynamips
jjensen@jjensen-dev:~/dynamips$ mkdir tmp
Step Two: Set up GNS3. Edit -> IOS images and hypervisors. Click the ""External Hypervisors"" tab. Add in the IP address info for your remote hypervisor (Most of the time you can leave all the fields besides IP address as the default). Once you've filled in the IP of your remote hypervisor, click ""Save"".

Once you have your remote hypervisor added, go back to the ""IOS images"" tab and add in IOS images. There are two important bits to remember:
Use the ""Linux format"" directory notation (see screenshot), and make sure that the ""use the hypervisor manager"" checkbox is unchecked so that you can select the remote hypervisor that you just added. When adding the IOS image with the remote hypervisor, make sure that your remote hypervisor is selected.

Once you have your IOS image added, start up Dynamips on your remote machine.
jjensen@jjensen-dev:~/network_eng/dynamips$ sudo ./dynamips-0.2.8-RC3-community-x86_64.bin -H 7200 &
You should now be able to add devices to GNS3 topologies on your Windows machine, and GNS3 will communicate with the remote hypervisor on another machine. You also get the console access via PuTTy and such for free as well. Note that there isn't really a ""configuration limit"" on how you want to add your IOS images and hypervisors. You could even have it so that you have a separate remote hypervisor per IOS image if you wanted. Pretty powerful stuff.
If anyone could add additional answers on how to make this work with JunOS/""virtual"" Olive, I think that would also be pretty useful. :-)

If you see MAC address is 'mac address-table' you have L2 connectivity. So nothing wrong in your test methodology.
"
CISCO Wireless Lan Controller and AP's design question,"

Putting the APs and the controller in the same L2 domain is the simplest solution as you don't have to do anything else for them to find one another.  If you put the APs on a different subnet then you have to either configure DHCP option 43 on the APs subnet or put in a DNS entry for cisco-capwap-controller.DOMAIN-APs-GET-FROM.DHC. Formerly this was cisco-lwapp-controller.
You'll need to give the secretary either admin or lobby admin access to the WLC so that they can create the logins.  It doesn't need an additional interface for guest wifi but you can use one and plug it into the DMZ for better isolation.

Edit: Corrected DHCP option number as @generalnetworkerror pointed out my faulty memory.

"
wireless - Directional Sending and Omnidirectional recieving,"
I think building this network has two separate problems: Building the desired directional properties from available antennas, and splitting the transmit and receive functionalities.
Directional antennas should be straightforward (but not necessarily easy.) Select one (or more) standard antenna designs which fit the ""sector"" properties you want. Cisco has some great information, and there is some directional antenna discussion here on NE. Since you are in a research environment, you could further tune your antenna properties with specially crafted and positioned grounded metal plates (etc) to tune your antennas. I would expect you'll need an accurate way to measure the signal strengths from your antennas.
There is also information on beam forming solutions from Cisco.

qos - How to generate traffic for lab scenarios,"
You can use iperf2 or iperf3 to help generate some traffic. There are quite a few options included that will allow you to accomplish some nice traffic classification.
You might also check out scapy - specifically a packet former utility. Allows you to define values on each field to get really granular with how traffic is being formed and sent.
In my lab, I have two virtual machines at opposite ends of a physical network. I use both tools I mentioned to send traffic between the virtual machines, but that traffic goes through my lab topology of Cisco routers/switches/firewalls. This way I can have a reliable flow of traffic that I define ahead of time per the lab scenario.
"
"fiber - What is a reasonable latency for a L2 1G leased line between 2 sites, about 420km apart?","
Each piece of equipment you run through will add latency through it. If you leased dark fiber between the two locations you should see something just under 3ms one way. Just under 6ms RTT.
How much latency a device will add can vary wildly depending on how efficient it is at processing the packet, how efficient it is at converting to/from light, if any buffering must be done due to over subscription, etc.
I don't know how your service is delivered but more than likely you're looking at something like this:

CE -> CPE -> PE -> P -> P -> PE -> CPE ->CE

CE = Client Edge
CPE = Customer Premesis Device
PE = Provider Edge
P = Provider Router (Similar to a Core device)

If each device adds 1ms of latency you've gone from 6ms RTT on dark fiber to 22ms. Each device will probably handle the packet for <1ms but you can see how this adds up.
More than likely the ""optimizations"" your SP did was to use MPLS-TE to use a more efficient route. I can't confirm this but there's no special voodoo you can throw at a box to make it all of a sudden decrease latency...at least none that I've found yet...still looking.
To sum up, I don't think 15ms is too outrageous. If you need better numbers from a latency perspective then you might want to consider other options.
Note: These times do not include any optical devices these lines might (more than likely) be going through. Things like multiplexers and amplifiers will add small amounts of latency as well. Over long distances the likelihood of going through a multiplexer increases greatly.
"
switch - Brocade switches per vlan STP support,"
It's important to note that PVST/PVST+ is Cisco proprietary.
They do support one instance of STP per VLAN, and it is enabled by default. You can enable/disable STP on the following levels (taken from the NetIron config docs):

Globally - Affects all VLANs
Individual VLAN - Affects all ports within the specified VLAN. When you enable or disable STP within a VLAN, the setting overrides the global setting. Thus, you can enable STP for the ports within a VLAN even when STP is globally disabled, or disable the ports within a port-based VLAN when STP is globally enabled.
Individual Port - Affects only the individual port. However, if you change the STP state of the primary port in a LAG group, the change affects all ports in the LAG group.

Depending on your code rev, you can enter config mode for the VLAN and either do:
[no] spanning-tree

or
[no] rstp
[no] spanning-tree 802-1w (used on older versions of code)

I know that newer NetIron gear has PVST/PVST+ compatibility modes which you can turn on at the interface level with:
pvst-mode

But this also implies that you're going to be running MST, which you said you're not going to do.
"
Are Brocade configuration commands the same across most or all their products?,"
Brocade's products come from multiple backgrounds, which is the cause of fragmentation in their command set - ie: their *Iron gear is from their acquisition of Foundry, whereas their fibrechannel products are their core product.
Cisco actually suffers the same problem when you branch out of the core routing/switching arena. Their WAAS products ape IOS, but that's really just a shell on top of the underlying product. The WLCs are off in their own little command structure land. Even the NX-OS gear looks an awful lot like IOS, but it's not definitively identical.
"
wireless - Is it necessary to use layer 2 switches with microwave point-to-point links?,"
I'd say ""probably"" ... depending on the size of the radio, the switch may be doing power injection, which will be something you need to consider before going straight to a router.
If you're primarily concerned about broadcasts rather than additional equipment, another answer is using VLANs to limit broadcast domains, allowing you to use the provided switch for more than just the radio when combined with the router.
At the end of the day a sure answer to this question is going to depend on the radio hardware itself.
"
fiber - Is it common for rackmountable servers to have fibroptic input and output? or is it cat 5 and you have to convert after?,"
SFP style input is really only common for 10Gig and beyond applications. You can get 1G SFP PCI cards for your servers but I think this would become very expensive when compared to a top of rack switch solution.
This sounds like a small business setup. From that perspective I would say that as long as the servers are < 100M from the switch and the cable doesn't directly go over florescent lights or something else that could create interference then you should be fine. If that's not the case and your servers are aggregated at 1Gb then I would recommend running fiber to a top of rack switch and using standard Ethernet to aggregate the servers.
On a final note I rarely see actual fiber optics going into a server. It's typically TWINAX if it's SFP based or CAT-5e or CAT-6.

troubleshooting - Recording latency between a controlled startpoint and uncontrolled endpoint,"
The latter half of your question seems to indicate you're looking for latency figures that take into account the process of forming application-layer data, in which case ""ping"" will not help much considering there's not much data to be formed in a ping packet.
Network folks usually rely on ping because it's a relatively light and reliable way to produce a certain amount of random data to test reachability and latency for a given path. An application which uses HTTP calls, for instance, will behave differently because HTTP is not the same as ICMP. 
If you're concerned with general network latency figures, outside of any application-specific context (which is the best way to test), ping works just fine.

layer1 - Connecting 2 FCoE Switches together with optical cable,"
Don't confuse FCoE with a ""standard"" fibre ethernet connection. FCoE, as the name implies, delivers fibrechannel over ethernet rather than over traditional fibrechannel connections, allowing for ""converged"" networking. Fibrechannel is typically used in storage networks, not general computing.
If all you're wanting to do is link to cabinets with fibre, you do not need FCoE. You just need two switches with multimode transcievers and then standard multimode cable with appropriate connectors for the transcievers. Typical new gear these days are SFP form factor transcievers and LC ends on cables.

Wow I had to dust off the cobwebs there, it has been a long time since someone mentioned Long Reach Ethernet.  I'm not aware off-hand of any vendors currently selling/supporting LRE equipment for use in the enterprise...
To find the Cisco page on Long Reach Ethernet, I had to dig into the ""Wayback Machine"".  (Looks like Cisco long ago took their page down.)
Cisco LRE Archived Page:

What is Cisco Long-Reach Ethernet Networking?
The Cisco Long-Reach Ethernet (LRE) broadband networking solution is the industry's first end-to-end product line for delivering 5-15
  Mbps performance over existing Category 1/2/3 wiring.
With Ethernet-like performance that reaches up to 5,000 feet, LRE enables
  simultaneous voice, video and data applications, such as high-speed
  Internet access, video streaming and IP telephony.

It could help in your situation, but the 2900's and Workstation bridges that you would need have to be nearly impossible to find anymore.  The last date for support was August 20, 2011.
I think at this point Cisco makes the assumption that everyone just has to suck it up and roll out the Cat5/6.
I'd love to know if I'm wrong though and someone is still making this type of equipment!  I've got a few remote offices that are in a similar situation.

vpn - What is the use of a tunnel interface on a cisco router?,"
Tunnel interfaces have many uses, including participating in a larger VPN configuration. A VPN setup usually has many parts, including encryption, authentication, routing, and finally, the tunneling. Tunneling is also used for IPv4/IPv6 coexistence setups, such as encapsulating IPv6 packets in IPv4 packets payloads, creating GRE tunnels, and multicast tunneling. The point is that while tunnels may be part of a VPN setup, they do not necessarily represent the entire VPN configuration, but only the traffic encapsulation between endpoints.

EDIT: While I thought that 10GBASE-ZR was Cisco-specific, it's not actually. The wikipedia page for the 10Gig standard states ""multiple manufacturers"" have introduced ""ZR"" optics which are based on the 80km PHY described in the OC192 SONET specs.

ethernet - Difference between LLDP and LLDP-MED,"
Media Endpoint Discovery is an enhancement of LLDP, known as LLDP-MED, that provides the following facilities:

Auto-discovery of LAN policies (such as VLAN, Layer 2 Priority and Differentiated services (Diffserv) settings) enabling plug and play networking.
Device location discovery to allow creation of location databases and, in the case of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), Enhanced 911 services.
Extended and automated power management of Power over Ethernet (PoE) end points.
Inventory management, allowing network administrators to track their network devices, and determine their characteristics (manufacturer, software and hardware versions, serial or asset number).

The LLDP-MED protocol extension was formally approved and published as the standard ANSI/TIA-1057 by the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) in April 2006.

ieee 802.11 - How to disable 802.11b wireless clients on my WLAN?,"
I have come across three different ways you may be able to go about disabling 802.11b, depending on your situation and wireless vendor.  I will start with what should generally be the most preferential choice, but any of them will work.

Your wireless vendor may provide a setting to ""disable 802.11b clients"" or similar.  Generally this will implement the next method automatically for you and may tweak some other settings as well.
Remove the following data rates (these are the 802.11b data rates); this is generally a WLAN or ESS based setting:

1 Mbps
2 Mbps
5.5 Mbps
11 Mbps

Adjust your base or required (terminology varies by vendor) data rates to remove the above data rates and select one or more of the following (or any other 802.11g data rate):

6 Mbps
9 Mbps
12 Mbps
18 Mbps


The third method allows you to keep the 1/2/5.5/11 Mbps data rates enabled in case you have non-802.11b devices that require them.  This may not be common, but I know that most Nintendo Wii gaming consoles require 1 and/or 2 Mbps to be supported to connect (although after they connect, they will operate at 802.11g speeds).  I have heard third hand that there is also a smartphone that has the same problem, but I do not know make/model or experienced it myself.
"
cisco 6500 - 10GigE fiber over a distance of 120km?,"
The distance of the fibre isn't a good indication of whether you'll be able to run a specific optic/speed across it.
You need the path loss (measured in dB), which can vary greatly between links of the same distance (due to number of splices, fibre quality etc.)  Also, the distance of the fibre in the ground is usually about 25-30% longer than the path it travels to allow slack for re-splicing, so you'll really need this info up front.
I'm not sure that that sort of distance will be possible at 10G with any off-the-shelf optics regardless, without some amplification.  There are however 1GE SFPs that should be able do this (-28dBm RX sensitivity)

ospf - Dynamic Routing Protocol (IGP) over IPSec VPN tunnels to branch offices?,"
Since you are using all ASA-X firewalls, I suggest you go with EIGRP and drop the GRE part - configure IPSEC VPN on ASA.
I had about 80+ branch offices connecting to main site with IPSEC VPN (Although tunnels were on routers not on firewalls) EIGRP played really well. EIGRP is much lighter with computations and has better performance than OSPF. Plus EIGRP is lot easier to troubleshoot and configure.
As for GRE you don't have that option (because you have ASA firewalls not routers) and if you ask me GRE is not the way to go with IPSEC VPN anyway.
"
"CISCO 4500R+E, Sup7L-E redundancy: RPR or SSO?","
SSO is preferred due to shorter switchover if supervisor fails. From Cisco:

With supervisor engine redundancy enabled, if the active supervisor engine fails or if a manual switchover is performed, the standby supervisor engine becomes the ""new"" active supervisor engine. The standby supervisor engine has been automatically initialized with the startup configuration of the active supervisor engine, shortening the switchover time (30 seconds or longer in RPR mode, depending on the configuration; subsecond in SSO mode).

Operation of RPR:

RPR is supported in Cisco IOS-XE Release 3.1.0SG and later releases. When a standby supervisor engine runs in RPR mode, it starts up in a partially-initialized state and is synchronized with the persistent configuration of the active supervisor engine.
In a supervisor engine switchover, traffic is disrupted because in the RPR mode all of the physical ports restart since there is no state maintained between supervisor engines relating to module types and statuses. Upon switchover, when the standby supervisor engine completes its initialization, it will read hardware information directly from the module and become the active supervisor engine.

So the redundant supervisor is only partially initialized. This means there will be a disruption when the supervisor fails over.
SSO on the other hand is fully initialized.

SSO is supported in Cisco IOS-XE Release 3.1.0SG and later releases. When a standby supervisor engine runs in SSO mode, the standby supervisor engine starts up in a fully-initialized state and synchronizes with the persistent configuration and the running configuration of the active supervisor engine. It subsequently maintains the state on the protocols listed below, and all changes in hardware and software states for features that support stateful switchover are kept in synchronization. Consequently, it offers zero interruption to Layer 2 sessions in a redundant supervisor engine configuration.
Because the standby supervisor engine recognizes the hardware link status of every link, ports that were active before the switchover will remain active, including the uplink ports. However, because uplink ports are physically on the supervisor engine, they will be disconnected if the supervisor engine is removed.
If the active supervisor engine fails, the standby supervisor engine become active. This newly active supervisor engine uses existing Layer 2 switching information to continue forwarding traffic. Layer 3 forwarding will be delayed until the routing tables have been repopulated in the newly active supervisor engine.

It is therefore recommended to run SSO. For full information go to Configuring Supervisor Engine Redundancy Using RPR and SSO on Supervisor Engine 7-E and Supervisor Engine 7L-E

routing - What is the difference between a VRF and GRF? (cisco),"
GRF is the global routing and forwarding table. Also known as the default VRF in other vendors. It's simply the regular RIB used when no VRFs are used, or the original VRF when other VRFs are used.
A VRF is a virtual routing and forwarding table which allows a physical router to run a 'virutal' router with it's own RIB and FIB and routing protocols.

"Cisco 2600 series router logging a lot of ""Memory allocation failed"" errors","
Do a 'show proc mem sorted' and check for biggest memory users. If that's something that is not related to configuration, it may be bug in the code. If that's something that's related to configuration, you may consider re/deconfigure unnecessary services.
As IOS can't defragment memory and you can't reclaim it unless some big allocating process frees memory, I'm afraid that to return to normal operation you need to reboot it. Then I'd start to monitor closely memory allocation in total and for the main processes that are using it. If it grows and router is not doing anything additionally, it's propably bug in the ""growing"" process. 12.3(26) has some memory oriented bugs, but you'll need to audit the config to check if you're affected.
"
layer1 - How fast can information travel through various media?,"
Signal travels roughly same speed in copper and fibre, copper being slightly faster. Fibre is determined by refractive index, typically speed being about 0.65c, i.e 200km per 1ms (single direction, not RTT).
Maximum theoretical throughput is hard to determine, maybedivide wavelengths to Planck length difference and light each up, so absurd amount. But in practice about 128 waves by 100G each in optical fibre.
For copper we're now doing 40G commercially, 100G will happen and is 400G the table. Obviously distances are very short.
"
switch - Building new network and need 200+ wireless devices,"
A couple of thoughts. I can go into more detail on any of these if you need me to.
-When it comes to wireless, there are two ways to plan. One is for coverage, the other is for capacity. Based on the number of devices(capacity) and space(coverage) that you describe, I believe that capacity is going to the be the bigger deciding factor. Remember that wireless is like using an old-school hub. Everyone hears everything. That also means that only one client can talk to one AP at a time. This isn't a limitation of a device (Cisco vs. Netgear) this is a limitation of the physical medium (airspace). Since you are programming for mobile devices, which will only support a single stream, you should plan on 1 dual band AP per 50 devices. If you choose to only support 2.4 or 5Ghz (airspace issues with neighbor offices for instance), then plan on 1 AP per 30 devices.
-The Cisco 887 only has a 100Mb connection. If you keep with your current plan, and do all of your L3 routing on the 887, it will become a bottleneck for anything that routes between your internal networks. Examples include: Local replication for Dropbox, Wireless synching between i-devices and itunes, Copying files from machine A to B, Time machine backups, etc. etc. This bottleneck occurs because anytime data must flow from one network to another (wlan to lan) it will need to be routed, and must go out, and then back in, from the same 100Mb interface. This might not be a big deal, but I wanted to mention it, just-in-case.
-The Wireless controllers are a good idea. The initial setup takes a little while longer, but from that point on, it becomes super easy to deploy more AP's or WLAN's. I don't know anything about them from personal experience, but I have heard good things about the Meraki AP's. It is an cloud-based controller solution, which Cisco recently bought. EDIT for clarity: I don't know anything about the Meraki solution. I know A LOT about the Cisco Wireless Controllers :-).
-How are you powering your AP's? Do you plan on using VOIP in the future? Consider both of these when considering whether or not to order a switch with PoE. 
-Also, just noticed, you are planning on putting a firewall in-line after the router. That further complicates your plan to route between subnets there. I would plan on purchasing an L3 switch. That would simplify the deployment considerably. 
Hope this helps. Good luck.

cisco - How to apply configuration after replacing Routing Engine(RE) for CISCO7609-S?,"
Your options are pretty limited, but I see two possible solutions.

Increase the baud rate for your serial connection. This will allow higher throughput on your serial link.
Temporarily set up a /30 link between your laptop and the Cat7600 and use a local tftp server to move the file into the startup config. If the RSP has a MGMT interface on the front you can use this.

ethernet - Accurate strategy for measuring point-to-point link performance?,"
If you're trying to test 1xGE No Drop Rate and measure circuit delay within 8ms, I would use nuttcp to test bandwidth and iperf2 / mtr to test delay.
I would do the following...

Find two linux desktop PCs, if possible (laptops are sometimes acceptable, but you might run into issues with chipset or bus performance at 1GE speeds).  You can boot into a Performance Sonar toolkit CD, if you don't want a permanent linux install on these boxes
Select packet sizes for your test.  Since you need voice support on the circuit, you should test streams with smaller frames, such as 128-byte ethernet frames.  If I was running the test, I would choose 128, 256, 768 and 1514 byte ethernet frames.
Test nuttcp UDP bandwidth performance of your linux PCs connected back to back before shipping one of them 100 miles away.  You want to ensure that you can measure 1000 Mbps at various packet sizes.  Be sure to account for the Inter-Frame Gap when you calculate expected throughput rates... for instance the best possible throughput you can expect on an untagged gige circuit at a 128-byte average ethernet frame size is 864.9 Mbps.
Use iperf2 or mtr to test circuit delay...
Pick a test window.  I think it's best to test circuits continuously for at least a day... two days to a week are preferable if you need to get a sense for potential oversubscription within your carrier's network.
Ship one of the PCs off to the remote site, preconfigured for the IP addressing you need on the link.

Misc thoughts
Other answers have suggested using iperf2 alone; however, it doesn't have CLI options to adjust the UDP packet size.  It also tends to demonstrate flaky performance at high speeds under MS Windows.
This Metro Ethernet Forum paper on testing carrier ethernet circuits will help provide a general understanding some of the tradeoffs you take when testing circuits.

cisco - What's the difference between CRS-1 and CRS-3,"
In March 2010, Cisco announced the introduction of the CRS-3 family. The switching capacity of this new product-line is increased more than three times as each switch-fabric line card can process 140 Gbit/s instead of 40 Gbit/s as in the old system. According to Cisco, the current users can upgrade to the CRS-3 system step by step and without serious outage as the chassis, interface-cards, management-systems etc. are the same. The main changes are in the switching-fabric and the option to use new interface modules supporting these higher speeds (14 or 20 × 10 Gb interfaces and 1 × 100 Gb ethernet interface).
For information about migrating from a Cisco CRS-1 to a Cisco CRS-3 chassis, refer to the Cisco CRS-1 Carrier Routing System to Cisco CRS-3 Carrier Routing System Migration Guide at the URL http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps5763/prod_installation_guides_list.html
"
Does authoritative DHCP server mean no static IP setting?,"
This only deals with how the DHCP server responds to a client DHCP REQUEST for a certain IP address that is not provided by the DHCP server configuration.
If it isn't part of the DHCP scope on the Mikrotik and the setting is yes, then it responds with a DHCP NACK message, which should prompt the client to do a DHCP DISCOVER.
If set to no, then it will just ignore those packets (assuming that there may be another DHCP server to handle the request).
This should have no effect on a statically assigned IP address since they do not make a DHCP REQUEST.  However, I always prefer to still do my static IP addresses through static reservations on the DHCP server when possible.
"
routing - What are the reasons for choosing separate or combined VPN and Internet routers?,"
There's a bunch of stuff to consider here, although a lot of it depends on your environment.
First, device flexibility. If there's an emergency update that needs a reboot of the device to take effect, are you ready to take down the combined services to deal with that update? This can become a rabbit's hole of ""what if?"" scenarios but it's something to think about.
Secondly, performance. Will a single device handle the encryption traffic and the routing? Will it do so for the lifetime of the product? Are you going to end up buying a ""big"" single replacement box because one of the functions needed more horsepower, where a ""medium"" and ""small"" box would do if they were separate?
Redundancy - this ties in to the flexibility point, do you require redundancy on any of these devices? Is it easier to maintain a single HA pair rather than multiples? Perhaps HA is only required for specific functions.
Routing - this can be fun if you've got separate devices bringing traffic in to the environment. Are they all aware of each other? Are they all aware of the (possibly) multiple paths available to each other? Simplifying down to less devices can be beneficial here, but if your environment isn't this involved you may never have to worry about it.
Additional services - are you running firewalling, traffic inspection, or threat prevention on these remote links? Are you going to need an additional ""protection"" box for every service you break out from the main device?
Those are some of the primary things we consider. In my opinion there isn't a simple ""always do it this way"" answer for this one.

ethernet - UDP Message Length Field and Pseudo Header,"
You're right UDP header is 8 bytes. So I can't really explain your 12+8 scenario. Pseudoheader refers to the header which is considered when calculating checksum, is is combination of IP + UDP + payload, but not all of if, hence pseudo.
20B is normal size for IPV4 (and TCP). So maybe confusion lies there?
If you can put your example online, it might help understanding what the author tries to communicate.
EDIT the packet you entered is 20+8+13 bytes. If your document claims 20+13, it is missing the UDP header.

brocade - Super Aggregated VLAN vs. Q-in-Q,"
Same thing, different (older) branding. Normally for 802.1ad there's a C-TAG and an S-TAG. The C-TAG (customer tag) will have almost always have a value of 8100 set in its TPID (tag protocol identifier) field. The S-TAG (service tag - the tag on top) will have a separate set of fields (same as the C-TAG: PCP/DEI/TPID/VID bits) and its TPID should be 0x88a8 by the standard. A lot of vendors will let you set the value for the S-TAG TPID to something arbitrary (Brocade likes to recommend 9100 a lot - probably for compatibility reasons). Some vendors (Brocade also being one of them) will let you also set the C-TAG TPID but I can't think of any useful reason why someone would want to deviate from the norm of 8100. It's more common to want/need to change the S-TAG TPID value.
"
cisco - Is migrating to VRF or rolling-back an easy proposition?,"
Using VRFs is easy but depending on the size of your topology can get messy if you only deploy VRF lite. VRF lite is the use of VRFs without using MPLS. If you don't have MPLS you need to run your IGP (OSPF) in vrf aware mode. So for every switch that you have you need to create an interface in the VRF that is used for peering OSPF with the other switches. So say that you have a topology like:
               +--------+         +--------+
               |        |         |        |
    +---------+|  SW2   +--------+|  SW3   +----------------+
    |          +--------+         +--------+                |
    |                                                       |
    |                                                       |
+---+---+                                              +----+---+
|       |                                              |        |
| SW1   |                                              |  SW4   |
+-------+                                              +--------+

So now the basic steps to move over to a VRF is to first create the VRF:
ip vrf Guest
rd 1:1

Then you need to have a L3 interface between the switches. Are you running L2 links today with SVI or do you have ""real"" L3 interaces? If you are using SVI it would be:
int vlan 12
ip vrf forwarding Guest
ip add 12.12.12.1 255.255.255.0
!
int vlan 23
ip vrf forwarding Guest 
ip add 23.23.23.2 255.255.255.0

If you are moving these IP addresses from the global table then there will be a disruption because when you move it to a VRF all your routing state will be cleared because at that point the VRF is empty.
Then you need to configure your IGP:
router ospf 1 vrf Guest
net 12.12.12.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
net 23.23.23.0 0.0.0.255 area 0

OSPF does not support having multiple VRFs under the same process number so you would need to run a new process number.
All show commands will use vrf to check the status like:
show ip route vrf Guest
show ip cef vrf Guest
ping vrf Guest x.x.x.x

"
Jumbo Ethernet Frame Deployment,"
Terms
Physical interface -- a layer-2 port or switchport. Refers to switch uplinks and downlinks in the context of this document. May or may not be performing 802.1q tagging.
Logical interface -- a layer-3 port or routed port. Refers to server interfaces, router interfaces, switch virtual interfaces and subinterfaces. Anything with an IP address.
Standard domain -- a set of layer-3-adjacent VLANs which operate at the standard Ethernet payload of 1500 bytes.
Jumbo domain -- a set of layer-3-adjacent VLANs which operate at an Ethernet payload MTU greater than 1500 bytes, usually 9000 bytes.
Network Topology
Jumbo frames are not a mix-and-match technology. Jumbo frames are deployed to a clearly delineated segment of the network which is bounded by a router. This layer-3 boundary is essential to support interoperability with the standard domain. The router provides fragmentation and ICMP responses for Path MTU Discovery that are not provided at the lower levels of the networking stack. All communication within the jumbo domain will enjoy support for larger payload, while all communication between standard and jumbo domains will occur at the standard payload size. Communication between discontiguous jumbo domains also occurs at the standard payload size.
Jumbo VLANs
Jumbo frames are not a mix-and-match technology. This point is worth repeating. A given VLAN belongs to the standard domain or the jumbo domain, never both. This means that all physical interfaces that carry a jumbo VLAN must permit jumbo frames. If a jumbo frame encounters a physical interface that does not permit jumbo frames it will be dropped. Likewise, all logical interfaces on a jumbo VLAN must be configured with the exact same MTU value.
Physical Interfaces
Physical interfaces can carry any number of standard and jumbo VLANs as long as jumbo frames are permitted on the interface. Also, both types of VLANs may be trunked to a host or router. It is only important that the logical interfaces on the host or router be configured with the proper MTU value for each respective VLAN. In this sense, there exists a disconnect between physical interfaces and logical interfaces. A physical interface must meet or exceed the jumbo MTU, it does not need to be an exact match.
Logical Interfaces
Jumbo frames are not a mix-and-match technology. There it is again. For all intents and purposes every physical interface in the network can permit jumbo frames whether it carries a standard VLAN, a jumbo VLAN or both. The logical interfaces is where the exact MTU match really matters. This is also where it can get a bit confusing. For instance, configuring a Cisco 6500 SVI for MTU 9000 permits an Ethernet payload of 9000 bytes while configuring an HP NIC team for MTU 9014 permits an Ethernet payload of 9000 bytes. This is because the Cisco value only specifies the payload and the HP value specifies the payload plus Ethernet header. It is important to be aware of these details to get the MTU match exactly right.
Validation
It is useful to be aware of methods for validating that a jumbo VLAN has been properly deployed. Ping tests are sufficient, but one must take care to set the DF bit. Both Cisco and Windows ping utilities offer a method to do this, but once again the method for counting the bytes differs. The length parameter on Cisco includes the ICMP payload, ICMP header and IP header. The length parameter on Windows only specifies the ICMP payload. A length of 9000 on Cisco and a length of 8972 on Windows both produce an Ethernet frame of length 9018 with a payload of 9000 bytes.
Conclusion
Hopefully someone out there will find this diatribe useful. In networking, I think we all know the importance of doing it right the first time. Please feel free to leave comments regarding the accuracy of information, potential improvements and additional references.

cisco - How to throttle speed for a particular computer with high activity?,"
Expanding upon @javano's answer...
I would change one thing, instead of policing the email traffic (which will drop traffic exceeding that rate) I would recommend just setting aside a small amount of bandwidth for that traffic.  Therefore, if nobody else is using the link the email can utilize the unused bandwidth
policy-map PM-Limit-Emails
 class CM-Match-Critical-Apps
  bandwidth percent 50
 class CM-Match-Scavenger
  bandwidth percent 1
 class class-default
  bandwidth percent 20
  fair-queue

I didn't get a sense of if the issue was the sending (outbound) or receiving (inbound) of large attachments so, since you are just connected to the internet, there will be the potential that this issue will continue as the ISP is not throttling the traffic (inbound) based on your classifications.  If you have a business class internet service there may be the possibility for them to install a similar policy on their end of your link but you will need to talk with your ISP to determine what, if anything, they will support.

spanning tree - Preventing STP loops in etherchannels configurations,"
You should not be using ""on"" for link aggregation as it can lead to problems.  On the side with aggregation statically on, it will use the interfaces in the etherchannel, no matter what the configuration is on the other side.
While storm control (from comments) can be very helpful with some of the problems that result, it does not resolve all of them.  For instance if one of the remote side links is an access port on a different VLAN, all traffic that goes down that port will likely never reach its destination.  Depending on how constant the traffic and the load balancing across the etherchannel, this may result in a complete ""outage"" for some hosts.
I always recommend the use of LACP over PAgP, so instead of desirable/auto or on, use either active on both sides or active on one and passive on the other.  The reason for this is that LACP is standards based while PAgP is Cisco proprietary.
Of course this is in part dependent on the hardware platform, so check the appropriate documentation for your platform.

"cisco - 1 router, 1 internet connection/IP","
Using a VRF is like using a seperate router. If you have the same WAN IP for both VRF's, then you have to configure it twice in both WAN interfaces. If you however only use one WAN interface, you'll have to divide this interface by trunking (using VLAN's) or subinterfaces. 
ex:
interface FastEthernet0.5
encapsulation dot1Q 5
ip address 1.1.1.1 255.255.255.252

Notice we do not use ip vrf forwarding, we are using the default vrf here
interface FastEthernet0.10
ip vrf forwarding wanconnection:1
encapsulation dot1Q 10
ip address 1.1.1.1 255.255.255.252 (<== this can be another IP if you prefer to divide it with 2 different IP's)

The connection then goes as follows:

your router (normal vrf) => wan connection => vpn used for dot1Q tag 5
your router (wanconnection:1 vrf) => wan connection => vpn used for dot1Q tag 10

if you want to do this without tagging and just have 2 physical interfaces, it's the same implementation:
interface FastEthernet0
ip address 1.1.1.1 255.255.255.252

interface FastEthernet1
ip vrf forwarding wanconnection:1
ip address 1.1.1.1 255.255.255.252 

Every other interface needed in the specific vrf ""wanconnection:1"" needs to be added in the same way: 
ip vrf forwarding wanconnection:1

ex:
interface FastEthernet4
 ip vrf forwarding wanconnection:1
 ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0

making a vrf: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/lan/catalyst4500/12.2/15.02SG/configuration/guide/vrf.html
ip vrf wanconnection:1
 rd 65000:1

the rd 100:1 command explained:
Creates a VRF table by specifying a route distinguisher. Enter either an AS number and an arbitrary number (xxx:y) or an IP address and arbitrary number (A.B.C.D:y).
for the routing part:
ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 1.1.1.2
ip route vrf wanconnection:1 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 1.1.1.2

If you only have one WAN connection without tagging enabled, you could use inter Vrf routing: http://packetlife.net/blog/2010/mar/29/inter-vrf-routing-vrf-lite/

What factors drive a Cisco IOS upgrade?,"
In order of preference/priority, our company tends to upgrade based on these factors:  

Vulnerabilities, vulnerabilities, vulnerabilities! 
Bugs 
Attaining new features not currently available-- new cards/modules have a ""first supported in"" IOS version which could be higher than what you have running
Migrating away from retired release trains
Matching versions on more recently deployed and similar hardware

A device that is very critical to the infrastructure may not be as aggressively upgraded as one that is less critical.  Consideration is given to the role of the device, the redundancy surrounding it, and the impact of the upgrade itself by the downtime incurred or by the possibility of having config feature behavior changes or different defaults when going between major versions.  This is the necessity question that also touches on soft costs such as the time and resources to accomplish the upgrades measured against the weight given to each of the factors such as vulnerabilities.
Be sure to subscribe to multiple vulnerability announcement sites such as Cisco PSIRT (Product Security Incident Response Team) and the US Cert (Computer Emergency Readiness Team).
A downgrade might be in order if:  

Organization has a policy to only run tested/QA'd versions and new equipment came with a more recent release.  
Org has a policy against running anything other than GD.



Use Cisco's Output Interpreter of ""show version"" to look for obvious 
issues/vulnerabities/bugs.    
Look for GD (General Deployment) releases and avoid DF (Deferred).   
Use ED (Early Deployment) only when it contains must-have features not available elsewhere.   
Avoid LD (Limited Deployment) when possible and use GD instead.

There are certainly arguments for going to an ED or LD version, but the desire, of course, is to get to the most stable version that meets requirements.  Use Cisco's Feature Navigator to help identify potentially different feature-sets (assuming you're licensed to use them).
"
Can a VLAN bridge be used to replace a bypass switch with an IPS device?,"
I don't believe this will be possible on one single switch. The reason being is that you are relying on STP to catch a link failure, but to go back to back on a single switch, you would have to suspend normal STP operation by either BPDU filtering or something similar.

"
brocade - VRRP and VRRP-Extended,"
VRRP-E is Brocade only. From Brocade documentation:

VRRP-E is a Brocade protocol that provides the benefits of VRRP
  without the limitations. VRRP-E is unlike VRRP in the following ways:

There is no “Owner” router. You do not need to use an IP address configured on one of the Layer 3 Switches as the virtual router ID
  (VRID), which is the address you are backing up for redundancy. The
  VRID is independent of the IP interfaces configured in the Layer 3
  Switches. As a result, the protocol does not have an “Owner” as VRRP
  does.
There is no restriction on which router can be the default master router. In VRRP, the “Owner” (the Layer 3 Switch on which the IP
  interface that is used for the VRID is configured) must be the default
  Master.

Brocade Layer 3 Switches configured for VRRP-E can interoperate only
  with other Brocade Layer 3 Switches.

"
cisco - OSPF LSA Performance Tuning,"
Honestly if you're concerned with best practices and keeping your LSDBs nice and neat, ready for fast convergence, I would recommend ensuring that your OSPF areas are constructed well. Keep LSAs that don't need to be in an area summarized, and don't let a single area grow too large.
"
cisco - What factors drive L2 vs L3 in the access layer?,"
L2 Access is often needed when autonomous wireless access points are deployed across multiple switches, thus allowing users to roam from AP to AP without having to get new addresses.  Current controller based wireless solutions tunnel the user traffic to a central drop-off point, so wireless APs can be connected in any subnet so long as they can communicate with the controller.
L3 in the access layer works well when there's no need for devices connected to multiple switches to access the same subnet/broadcast domain.  It eliminates the need for loop prevention (STP) and VLAN trunking configuration (such as Cisco VTP or manual VLAN configuration).
L3 access layers do add their own requirements for protocols and configuration.  Unless you want to do static routing you have to take on configuration of a dynamic routing protocol such as such as OSPF (standard) or EIGRP (Cisco).
In L3 access networks with dynamic routing it is also a good idea to summarize or tune advertised routes between layers of the network.  For example, you can advertise only a default route from the Aggregation layer to the Access layer to limit the number of routes a simple access switch must learn and maintain.  Turning off auto summarization on the Access switches can also help prevent a misconfiguration from causing one switch to advertise routes it should not. Auto summarization is disabled by default on many current software revisions, but is worth verifying for your switch and software version.
Finally, access layer diameter is a factor in choosing L2 or L3.  If you want to daisy-chain one access switch off another (where one switch does not connect directly to aggregation) you may need expanded features to run dynamic routing.  In Cisco switches you need a more advanced IOS license to run EIGRP in non-Stub mode, allowing it to advertise routes it learned from another switch to the rest of the network.
"
cisco - Default-network and default-gateway,"
ip default-gateway is to be used in L2 devices. 
ip default-network would be used in L3 devices, but works slightly different from the usual static default route configured with ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 <next_hop>. Let's say you configure ip default-network 172.31.0.0. Then, if the device already knows a route for 172.31.0.0, this route will be flagged as a default route candidate. 
You need to take into account that ip default-network command is classful.

"
Brocade MLX reapplying modified ACL,"
It likely has to do with how the TCAM is programmed (see edit below - Brocade refers to it as CAM). I'd definitely be interested to hear why adding a completely separate ACL (vs just an entry in an ACL) would require you to ""reapply the ACLs"". Do you have a source for that quote? If you don't have an SE assigned to your account, I do have contacts that I can ask and get clarification on this.
While not Brocade, I have had experience with vendor hardware where modifying an ACL ""in place"" would cause certain rules ""further up"" in the ACL to be completely ignored/stop functioning. Until the bug was actually fixed, the only workaround was to delete the ACL itself, and then recreate it with all of the rules before applying it to any interface.
Edit: Turns out my original thought was correct - from NetIron documentation:

How the Brocade device processes ACLs
The Brocade device processes traffic that ACLs filter in hardware. The Brocade device creates an entry for each ACL in the Content Addressable Memory (CAM) at startup or when the ACL is created. The Brocade device uses these CAM entries to permit or deny packets in the hardware, without sending the packets to the CPU for processing.

And then further down on the next page:


If you change the content of an ACL (add, change, or delete entries), you must remove and then reapply the ACL to all the ports that use it. Otherwise, the older version of the ACL remains in the CAM and continues to be used. You can easily re-apply ACLs using the ip rebind-acl num | name | all command. Refer to “Applying ACLs to interfaces” on page 1018.

"Why do I get a timeout when I connect via ssh to a Cisco ASA, even though management and ACLs are configured?","
Unfortunately the ASA doesn't show a good explanation in the error message. It's required to create an RSA key on the ASA, either via console or command line in the ASDM, executing the command crypto key generate rsa, for example with highest possible modulus size:

in global configuration mode. The default modulus would be 1024.
With the ASDM it can also be done in the configuration menu, device management, identity certificates, add, new:

"
wan optimizer - TCP acceleration over satellite or high latency networks,"
I used to deploy WAN acceleration devices for a hardware vendor about 6 years ago. Not much has really changed since then except I won't make hardware recommendations because of consolidation and changing product lines.
All of these devices use some combination of compression and caching to reduce the overall traffic to be transmitted, TCP pre ack'ing to reduce the effects of bandwidth delay product (this is the TCP window effect that you alluded to above) and ganging of undersized packets to insure that packets traversing the links are as full as possible reducing the effect of overhead. The various vendors will throw in their own patented technologies as well, but they mostly boil down to different flavors of these.
While caching is a major help, just the pre-ack'ing of packets over a satellite link will go a long way to making them usable, so that even if your data isn't cacheable for whatever reason (encrypted, compressed, zipped, always changing drastically, etc) if you have a slow enough RTT the pre-ack'ing will partially eliminate the bandwidth delay product and help you get closer to your nominal bandwidth.
Since the whole goal is to drive up network efficiency and allow higher utilization of your bandwidth, it's very important that underlying network problems that may pop up with high utilization are fixed before deploying a solution. If you have duplex mismatches or are running on half-duplex connections you'll often find that performance is worse than before you deployed wan optimization devices. Often I would find that customers didn't realize that they had some links that had auto-negotiated down to the lowest common denominator of 10 Mbps half duplex.
Many of these devices also offer Forward Error Correction (which your modems probably offer as well) which you can use to overcome some of the effect of packet loss on your links. This is important since the packet stuffing means that more than one LAN packet could be lost for each WAN packet that gets lost and because of the pre-ack'ing those packets have already been acknowledged to the servers. Make sure that you know which devices in your path are performing FEC so that you don't create more overhead than necessary since this will of course reduce your effective throughput.
Speaking from experience, I saw customers without significant caching able to do 'acceptable' (mostly one way) video conferencing over a double satellite hope whose latency ranged from 900 ms to 2 seconds and might have 15-25% packet loss for extended periods. I wouldn't choose to use the resulting flow, but if that's what you have it'l work.

Can Juniper EX series switches terminate a q-in-q interface?,"

The best you could do with the EX is strip off the outer-tag and push those inner frames to another EX.

PIM-SM multicast and HSRP/VRRP,"
PIM messages are not sourced from HSRP VIP's so the RPF check fails since the HSRP VIP is your RPF neighbor.  There are two ways around this though.

"
routing - Circular BGP propagation,"
You're kind of thinking about it the wrong way, but I'll try to explain.
When you purchase bandwidth from an ISP, this is called transit (colloquially in the industry). Assuming you've got yourself some PI space (1.0.0.0/8, for example), you're paying your ISP to get your bits from your network to other networks. So say your AS is 6500, and your ISP is 3356. Bits from any other ASN will also need to transit AS3356 to get to you. Let's say that there's another ASN (6501) that buys transit from a different ASN (7224). AS3356 and AS7224 are peers. Now, in order for bits to get from AS6501 to AS6500, the path goes like this:
AS6501 -> AS7224 -> AS3356 -> AS6500

Now if you set up peering (also a colloquial industry term**) with AS6501, this eliminates the need to get bits from you to AS6501 via transit and vice versa, thus reducing your cost, AS6501's operator's cost, and also usually results in reduced loss/latency between your networks. Everybody wins! Now the path looks like this:
AS6501 -> AS6500

Your original scenario wouldn't work in the real world, because the assumption for AS6501 would be for it to incur a cost to get your bits across it to you from the ISP(s). AS6501 wouldn't be getting benefit by hauling your bits across it to your ISP so you don't have to pay your ISP. What's more likely is AS6501 would charge you to do this, at which point, you might as well just pay your ISP(s) anyway.
** The term peering is overloaded. It can be both used to describe a BGP session (e or i variety), as well as the colloquial/political sense, which means you and another network connect to one another and directly exchange traffic (via BGP) for mutual benefit - think opposite of transit. If you're running BGP with your ISP (transit), you're still technically peering with your ISP, because it's an eBGP peering. To help avoid confusion, it's better to use peering to refer to the act of exchanging traffic with another network at no cost (note that this isn't always the case) and BGP session to refer to the actual technical term for exchanging prefixes via BGP (iBGP or eBGP) with another router, whether a cost is involved or not.
"
troubleshooting - What is the meaning of the CRC counter on a cisco device?,"
The counter is increasing because your frames are being corrupted.
CRC is a polynomial function on the frame which returns a 4B number in Ethernet. It will catch all single bit errors and a good percentage of double bit errors. It is thus meant to ensure that the frame was not corrupted in transit. If your CRC error counter is increasing it means that when your hardware ran the polynomial function on the frame, the result was a 4B number which differed from the 4B number found on the frame itself.
Ethernet frame CRC (FCS) is usually understood to be on OSI layer 2, many people claim it is layer 1 on Ethernet, but that is incorrect (only preamble, SFD and IFG are layer 1 on Ethernet).
I recommend a book called Computer Networks - A systems approach on this and many other subjects. It discusses CRC in-depth around page 92 through 102.
As Daniel pointed out, frames can get corrupted due to several reasons such as: duplex mismatch, faulty cabling and broken hardware. However, some level of CRC errors should be expected and the standard allows up-to 10-12 bit-error-rate on Ethernet (1 bit out of 1012 can flip) and it's acceptable according to the standard. 
In copper the signal travels by transferring state between electrons (electrons themselves are not traveling very much) and in fiber the signal travels by the photons reflecting off the walls of the fiber. There is a non-zero chance that the photon will simply change due to heat on the walls or the state of the electrons will flip itself.  So even in perfect situations some errors will always happen.  It should be known that a bit is not a single photon or single state change of an electron; today you need many photons or electron state changes to express a single bit, so a single incorrect 'state' will not yield an error as a bit is the average state of many of these.
"
"cisco - POE, POE+, UPOE - Ntwork Enginring Stack Exchang","
Like many standards, the initial standard is never sufficient to the developing technology.  Once people have the ""ability"" to do something, they will often find new (and previously unexpected) ways of using that ability.  802.11 wireless is a prime example as no one originally expected it to develop into a ""wired replacement"" that we are heading towards today in many cases.
802.3af was largely implemented to power VoIP phones and early access points.  The list of devices that started using it grew quickly, and as it grew and the technology changed,  it was found that 802.3af didn't deliver enough power for everything people wanted.  For instance, it could power a video camera, but maybe not a PTZ video camera.  Or it could power that single radio access point, but not a 802.11n (more complex and power hungry) dual radio access point.  Basic VoIP phones were fine, but high definition screen with video capability VoIP phones didn't have the power needed.
It was also found to be somewhat inefficient in it's power delivery.  Short of vendor proprietary extensions, a PoE port always delivered 15.4W of power to the device, even if the device didn't need that much.
So, another standard was developed to meet these needs, 802.3at.  This provides up to 30W of power and allows devices to negotiate their power needs.  If you only need 3W of power, it can do so and doesn't need to deliver 30W.  Interoperation with 802.3af devices is accomplished by delivering 15.4W to any device that doesn't negotiate for more or less.
Cisco came up with the 60W for exactly the reason I gave to start out (they were also one of the first to deliver inline power, and higher than 15.4W of power through proprietary protocols).  If the ""ability"" is there,  then people will come up with ways to use it.  Their thought process is ""why limit what we can do within the power budget?  Let's just provide more power.""
This is both good and bad.  Good because we will see new abilities by PoE devices or entirely new PoE devices that were not previously realized.  Bad because there are other concerns to keep in mind.
For instance, most people don't consider heat in their cable plant when thinking about PoE (for instance look here or here for examples).  The more power you run through a cable, the more heat that it generates and needs to be dissipated.  This may reduce how far you can run cables depending on the category of your cables.  Others have raised concerns because data cabling is often ""bundled"" with up to hundreds of data cables being tightly bound together and this can result in higher temperatures in the center of the bundles.
Cisco claims that UPoE is better than 802.3at at heat dissipation, but I have yet to find a non-Cisco document (or non-Cisco sponsored) that bears this out.
Another concern is that the more power you need to deliver to end devices through PoE, the more power the switch needs to draw.  How big would the power supplies on a Cisco 4500 have to be to provide up to 60W on its potential 384 UPoE ports (in addition to the power needs of the switch itself)?  UPSes to provide reliable power to these pieces of network equipment would then have to be upsized as well.
If it shapes up that the industry find use for 60W, then the IEEE will draft another ammendment/standard.

ipv4 - Finding the IP of a MAC Address,"
There are a couple of options.
If you are doing DHCP snooping, you should be able to find the IP address in the binding database with the following command:
show ip dhcp snooping binding 00:00:00:00:00:00

If you don't have DHCP snooping, the Cisco device is on the same subnet (or supports multip SVIs so you can add an interface on the subnet), you are on a newer IOS (12.2ish or better) with access to TCL, and the device will respond to a ping, then you can use a TCL script.  You can find many examples on the internet, one of which can be found here.  Once it is able to ping the device (on the same subnet), it should be in the ARP table of the Cisco device.
Generally, it would be quicker/easier to check on the L3 device for the ARP entry or the DHCP server then the second option.
Old answer (prior to question change):
Strictly answering your question, no there is no way to derive an IP address of a device from the MAC address table entry.
The MAC address table is strictly speaking a L2 set of information, tying devices to an interface.  At L2, there is no awareness of an IP address (as the L3 and above information is irrelevant to L2 and could just as easily be another protocol).
You would need access to the L3 device for the remote network segment where you could look up the entry in the ARP table.

Brocad chassis and CDP - Ntwork Enginring Stack Exchang,"
As far as I know, you can only tell Brocade to intercept (i.e. be able to understand) CDP or not (i.e. forward them along).  If you have CDP off, then they will be forwarded on and won't show up in a show fdp neighbor output.

"
ethernet - Do faster segments of a network mean faster flow rate or lower latency?,"
Neither, really. Replacing a copper link with a fiber link might lower latency a tiny bit (assuming an uncongested link), but what you really get when you replace a ""core"" link with a higher bandwidth link is less possible congestion. In your example scenerio, it doesn't matter, because there is only one device on each end. In a live network, though, moving from 1g to 10g core links will ease congestion problems within the core of the network.
Now, as a side affect, you may get lower latency and better traffic flow, but that is purely due to easing congestion so the routers/switches aren't overloaded and dropping/queueing traffic.
"
cisco - Output Drops on Serial interface: Better queueing or Output queue size?,"
You're right, you wouldn't really see the burstiness easily on SNMP. 1GE can send 1.48Mpps, so it takes very very little time to congest the the 45Mbps, which can handle less than 75kpps.  
If your ingress is 1GE and egress is 45Mbps, then obviously the congestion point of 45Mbps will need to drop packets. This is normal and expected. If you increase buffers you'll introduce more delay.
1GE takes 0.45ms to send 40 1500B IP frames, which is right now the amount of burst you can handle. However dequeueing them on the 45Mbps already takes 10ms.
If you don't have any acute problem, I would probably not do anything about it. But if some traffic is more eligible for dropping than other, then you should replace FIFO with class-based queueing. Say maybe you want to prioritize so that more ftp is dropped and less voip.
Then it'll also make more sense to add more buffering on the ftp traffic, as it's not really sensitive to delay.
If you want to try your luck with deeper buffers, something like this should suffice:
policy-map WAN-OUT
 class class-default
    fair-queue
    queue-limit 200 packets
!
interface Serial1/0
  service-policy output WAN-OUT

This would cause 50ms buffers on the Serial1 and would allow you to handle up-to 2.25ms burst from single Gige interface.
"
Is it possible to remotely influence BGP localpref?,"
It is unlikely (but not impossible) for the communities you tag on your routes to propagate past your upstream. Most providers will strip the communities out before readvertising routes up/downstream.
If you want to influence multiple remote ASes in this manner, you would need to use AS_PATH prepending. Prepend 2-3 times to your backup/passive provider, and then most/all traffic will flow down your active path until it fails. Then traffic should shift to your passive path once the failed route gets withdrawn.
"
IPv4 Address Space Planning Best Practices,"
Being in a semi-small company, we broke down our private network somewhat liberally as so:
/24 per Vlan
/16 per location
Vlans are spread out, skipping 10 /24s per. Vlan number matches the third octet. Locations are sequential, starting 10 /16s in.
i.e.

10.10.1.0/24 - Location A, Management Vlan 1
10.10.11.0/24 - Location A, Wireless Vlan 11
10.11.11.0/24 - Location B, Wireless Vlan 11
10.11.81.0/24 - Location B, SAN Vlan 81
10.11.101.0/24 - Location B, Wired Office Vlan 101

Vlan examples:

1 - management
2 - management for wireless
11 - wireless access
21 - guests
31 - mobile devices
41 - factory equipment
51 - SAN
61 - VoIP
71 - Wired access

And so on.
The benefits we saw with this are:

Easy to refer to an entire location via /16. We use this quite often for VPN ACLs.
Easy to group device types together for web filtering.
Any Vlan within the next 10 /24s belongs to the same type as the previous root. 

So for example, factory equipment... Vlan 31, for certain vendors who have 24/7 remote access, we gave them their own Vlan, 32 or 33 or 34, up to 40. Their VPN access limits them to the equipment that they support without getting granular on IPs/ACEs. If the manufacturing team needs to drop more equipment in, we don't have to update the VPN ACLs. This also includes access ACLs/ACEs between Vlans.
Another example: SAN Vlans, we use two of them at minimum for redundancy. So they are always 81 and 82.
Last example: Wireless management is broken out to its own Vlan, 2. We do this because we have enough APs to need a WLAN controller but no budget for controllers. This Vlan uses tftp and dhcp options to auto configure and boot the APs from a central config repo and we don't want other equipment that can auto boot to pull the wireless configs.


This setup gives us an easy way to look at an IP and know the location and type of equipment it belongs to. This means less ACLs/ACEs in configuration files for us, especially on limited VPN users. We also have breathing room for expansion in the event we run out of IPs in a Vlan or because we need to further segregate traffic. And since we're a small company, we haven't broken into three digit location numbering yet. Plenty of growth room.

cisco - CEF operations on L3 switch vs router,"
NAT can of course use CEF. This is from Cisco's own guide over here: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_q_and_a_item09186a00800e523b.shtml
Q. What kind of routing performance can be expected when using Cisco IOS NAT?

    A. Cisco IOS NAT supports Cisco Express Forwarding switching, fast switching, and process switching. For 12.4T release and later, fast-switching path is no longer supported. For Cat6k platform, the switching order is Netflow (HW switching path), CEF, process path.

    Performance depends on several factors:

        The type of application and its type of traffic

        Whether IP addresses are embedded

        Exchange and inspection of multiple messages

        Source port required

        The number of translations

        Other applications running at the time

        The type of hardware and processor

Bigger platforms running IOS-XR, where the FIB gets ditributed to the line cards, also support carrier grade NAT, so it's usefulness is not limited to the LAN alone.
Also a lot of Cisco's L3 switches simply do not do NAT at all

cisco - RIP routing is broken between two routers,"

they are assigned by default to 172.16.0.0 in both cases, and it does not work

I modified your ascii art a litte to reduce scrolling... It sounds like you're saying that you can't reach reach N1 from N2...
Broken RIPv1 topology
=====================

N1 ---- (172.16.1.1/24) R1 (172.16.3.1/30) ----- (172.16.3.2/30) R2 ----- (172.16.2.1/24) N2

Classful routing protocol overview
RIPv1 is a classful routing protocol... as such, it doesn't associate netmasks with routes when they are advertised.  Classful routing protocols do a couple non-intuitive things...

They only advertise routes out interfaces where the masks match (this is your problem)
They automatically summarize at major network boundaries (see bonus material, below)

Interface netmasks
To make your topology work, your masks will have to match on all RIPv1 interfaces, unless you use a classless routing protocol (such as RIPv2, EIGRP, OSPF, or ISIS).  If you need to use RIPv1, then reconfigure your topology such that all interfaces have matching masks, like this...
Functional RIPv1 topology
=========================

N1 ---- (172.16.1.1/24) R1 (172.16.3.1/24) ----- (172.16.3.2/24) R2 ----- (172.16.2.1/24) N2

Bonus material: RIPv1 Auto-summarization Example
Since this also tends to trip people up, I am including an example of RIPv1 auto-summarization dynamics.
When I mention major network boundaries below, I'm talking about the classic definitions for Class A, Class B, and Class C IPv4 networks...

Class A (8-bit netmasks): 1.0.0.0/8 - 127.0.0.0/8
Class B (16-bit netmasks): 128.0.0.0/16 - 191.255.0.0/16
Class C (24-bit netmasks): 192.168.0.0/24 - 223.255.255.0/24

Moving on to the RIPv1 auto-summarization example...  I will use matching /24 interface netmasks for simplicity.
Lo0:
192.168.1.0/24
Lo1:
1.1.2.0/24
+----+                  +----+                     +----+
| R1 +------------------+ R2 +---------------------+ R3 |
+----+                  +----+                     +----+
          1.1.1.0/24              172.16.1.0/24

router rip               router rip                 router rip
 version 1                version 1                  version 1
 network 192.168.1.0      network 1.0.0.0            network 172.16.0.0
 network 1.0.0.0          network 172.16.0.0

The routing table on R3 contains:
C     172.16.1.0/24
R     1.0.0.0/8        <--- 1.1.1.0/24 and 1.1.2.0/24 are ""hidden"" by the 
                            classful summary at R2

R     192.168.1.0/24   <--- 192.168.1.0/24 passes transparently through R2
                            since it's a Class C network itself and is not 
                            summarized at R2

R1 and R2 are connected by subnets of the 1.0.0.0/8 major network, so 1.1.1.0/24 and 1.1.2.0/24 are advertised between R1 and R2; however, the link between R2 and R3 is not in 1.0.0.0/8, therefore R2 performs automatic summarization of subnets of 1.0.0.0/8 and subnets of 172.16.0.0/16.
When subnets of a major network are summarized, they get hidden by the summarized route...  This happens at R2 when 1.1.1.0/24 and 1.1.2.0/24 are summarized to 1.0.0.0/8.  Cisco routers cannot disable auto-summarization under RIP version 1 (but they can for RIPv2).
"
cisco - Embedded routers vs. software routers in the datacentre,"
To name a few things: development, maintenance testing and support of software and hardware and of course: marketing and profit. Also, these vendors use dedicated ASICs so packet forwarding (amongst other things) are done in hardware instead of software. Basically, you buy a box which is optimized for one task: routing, which means all code and hardware has been tested for that. 
Software routers are often ok, especially if you don't have a large budget or just need to build a lab setup. However, if you run into problems there's a chance you're either on your own figuring out if it's the routing software, your hardware, the kernel or something else. I'm not saying this is a bad thing (some of these projects have many active users), it's just something to consider.
A full BGP feed is almost 450K IPv4 prefixes by now by the way, and nearly 13K IPv6. If I'd be building a software router, I'd do some research on which NICs to use and how to optimize them and put a lot more than 2G of RAM in the box.
"
AAA/TACACS+ password on Cisco switch always fails at second password prompt,"
I would do a debug on your TACACS+ server while you are trying this.
I'll assume that you only want to use TACACS authentication and only fall-back to local logins if it can't access the server?
Try using this:
aaa authentication login default group tacacs+ line
 aaa authentication enable default group tacacs+ enable
Also see this site: It has some good examples and explanations
http://my.safaribooksonline.com/book/networking/cisco-ios/0596527225/tacacsplus/i13896_heada_4_2#X2ludGVybmFsX0h0bWxWaWV3P3htbGlkPTA1OTY1MjcyMjUlMkZpNTAzNjNfX2hlYWRhX180XzEmcXVlcnk9
My guess is that since you have the ""local"" keyword in:
aaa authentication login default group tacacs+ local line
The TACACS+ authentication returns a fail, so the router tries doing local authentication. I guess you should provide us with the line vty sanitized configuration.
If you have
line vty 0 15
  login local
Then it would do a username/password authentication otherwise its doing password

cisco - ISR routers - difference between routed and switched ports,"
I would use ESW card in router if I had small office that needs to have 5 users connected. Then I would have router and switch in same device instead of buying a separate 2960 or such.
The only benefit I see with using EHWIC card would be if you need to use LAN features like port security, private VLAN, DHCP snooping etc. However in the first case you mentioned you would use the router as pure router and leave switching features for a real switch.
So it boils down to if you want to have routing/switching in one device or multiple. The only real use case I see for it is small office that doesn't need 24-p switch. You would only need to manage one device as well.

You could try disabling the Next Generation Maps in Monitor > Site Maps Properties to see if this makes a difference.  It did on my map test.  There are performance reasons for not doing this.

You might also be able to manually resize the image.  Go into Edit Floor, then on the bottom-left, you'll see your 200x800 map.  Use the CTRL-click to drag the blue edges to your desired size.

"cisco - BGP ""no synchronization"" command not showing up in running-config","
In most modern versions of IOS (since 12.2(8)T - thanks @ytti) BGP synchronization is disabled by default (and shown in the running config as such, ie no synchronization shows up in show run when you turn on BGP). As to which IOS version they decided to make it a ""hidden default"", I'm not entirely too sure, but you should be able to do:
show running-config all

or
show running-config full

To get the router to show the entirety of the running config, including the defaults which are normally hidden. Look for no synchronization in there.

upgrade RAM on a Cisco ASA 5520,"
Assuming it's a real 5520 and not a fake that's actually a converted 5510 (yep, a bunch of those were floating around - you'll know it by the fact it's only got a single RAM slot) you'll want PC3200 with CAS latency (CL) of 3 running at 400MT/s, unbuffered, ECC.
Not sure if the ASAs are also picky about the chip arrangement too, so if you want to play it super safe, make sure the RAM you buy has the memory spread across 8 chips.
"
cisco - Why we get high fluctuation on bandwidth measurement Cacti graph?,"
To extend ytti's comment.
Your poll interval seems really small, every 10 seconds if I'm reading right. There's a few reasons you could get that result.
Equipment side:

Bad choice of counters, if you're using 32-bit counters they could be rolling over every ~3.4 seconds if you're running a 10g interface at line rate
Counter updating, many larger devices only update counters two or three times a minute, and they can never be relied on to be in sync. Every 30 seconds is as low as I'd bother polling, and even then I'd always want at least two points before triggering any alert or taking action
There can be a gotcha as packets sent for CPU processing (netflow perhaps) may be counted straight away vs those not going to RE being batched (have seen this on Juniper MX)

Poller side:

Is the poller polling accurately at the interval, and if not is it injecting its result with the actual polling time (eg, x bits in y.z seconds) so a sensible rate can be calculated
What happens when counters reset, or SNMP GET's aren't responded to, different tools respond to these in different ways

"
"Why does ipv6 specify 128 bit address, when there are only 48 bits in MAC addresses?","
MAC addresses only need to be unique in a local broadcast domain, not globally, so re-use of MAC addresses in different networks usually isn't a problem. 
The internet isn't one global broadcast domain and thus needs to be divided into many blocks of addresses assigned to different ISP's and each ISP divides his blocks into smaller blocks for different customers/services. To allow each of these smaller blocks to contain many MAC addresses you need to have the IP-space much bigger than the MAC address space.
"
cisco - What happens when 2 computers transmits at the same time to a 3rd one in a full duplex switch?,"
The switch will fully load the incoming frames of data, from the two sending systems, into its buffer(s). I'm not sure how it determines which frame would be first in the queue for subsequent forwarding; but it's probably based on initial receive time of the beginning of the frame. Then the switch works through the transmit buffer queue sending the frames out one-by-one onto the destination port/segment.
There's no issue with frames ""running into each other."" The real issue is can the ultimate port/segment accept the frames fast enough. (And, of course, can the switch process its buffer/queues fast enough.)

"
bgp - How can I check to see if I am receiving MED's?,"
Removing previous answer as I misunderstood the question, and my previous answer was actually incorrect - MED is exchanged between peer ASN's but is not propagated beyond that (meaning it won't transit an AS to propagate to another AS). However it's still an optional attribute, so it's not required of an implementation to pass on the MED between eBGP/iBGP speakers. MED is typically only evaluated in the best path selection process if there are multiple paths coming from the same AS (relevant in your scenario).
If you've got the same provider at both locations it's likely that they'd set a MED on all of the prefixes rather than a subset, and if you don't see that in your output, it's likely that they're not sending you MED's. However it's also a possibility that they're only setting MEDs on aggregates that the provider actually owns rather than peer/customer prefixes. This doesn't mean that you can't set the MED yourself as part of your inbound policy for your iBGP routers to pay attention to however. Also consider sending MEDs to your provider to force them to do cold-potato routing towards you.
Edit: to also include @MikePennington's good and relevant info and depending on your design, your IGP will also solve this problem for you without the need to worry about setting MEDs or LP values.
To answer your question, you could create a route-map with a match clause that matches a given MED value, and then do show ip bgp routes route-map [route-map-name]. For this I'd recommend something like:
route-map ONLY-MED deny 10
    match metric 0
route-map ONLY-MED permit 20

# show ip bgp routes route-map ONLY-MED

This should show you all the prefixes that don't have a MED of 0 set.
"
cisco asa - Firewall Replication,"
We have a similar setup but with two sets of 8.2(5) and we have used an in-house script to detect config changes to the primary pair, change the necessary details to make it connectable in the second DC and push the config to the second firewall pair and finally reboot.
This only works for us because the second FW pair is completely passive whilst a failover isn't active.
All the script basically does is pull the active config, run a regex to replace the management details with those of the second pair, a regex to replace the SNMP, hostname etc. Once done it TFTP's the config to the second pair and initiates a reboot.
"
idf - Ethernet termination density per rack and space planning,"
I would consider this too much for one rack.  You always want to leave yourself at least some space for the future.  I have seldom been in situations where less space is used in a rack over time, rather quite often the opposite (you end up needing more).
Figure it this way: 

Typical 48 port switch = 1U
Typical 48 port patch panel = 2U
Typical full rack = 42U

For 600 terminations, you will need about 39U worth of switches and patch panels, which doesn't leave much room, especially for things like UPSes or any other equipment.  
If you decide you want any horizontal cable management, there isn't room unless integrated into the patch panels and then depending on brand/model, these may be 3U.
If you go with a chassis based switch solution (now or the future), this also wouldn't work as usually these are not as space efficient (while line cards take up only 1U, their power supplies will take up additional space).
If you need to add more cabling in the future, again you wouldn't have space.
Go for the second rack and give yourself some space.
Edit: Adding this to comment on some of the other answers.  I left the actual rack layouts out of my answer originally as they are an issue for much discussion as there is no ""correct"" way to do it.  While several good ideas are proposed, a rack design/layout has to address the concerns of your environment and what will provide your organization a reliable and manageable solution.
While there are some things that should be done for any proper installation (racks should be properly grounded, if you use two post racks a ladder rack or other means of securing/stabilizing the top should be installed, etc), many of them come down to personal preference.
For instance, some cabling companies will tell you that you should not put patch panels on the lower 1/3-1/2 of the rack, as it is harder to terminate and prone to more errors.  Some will say you shouldn't do any sort of patch panel/switch/patch panel layout as getting access to the back of the patch panels (for additional cabling or repairs) can be restricted.
In earthquake prone areas, some people will tell you that you should mount your equipment in the bottom half of the rack (with heaviest items - UPSes - at the bottom) as this provides a more stable rack.  The more weight at the top of the rack, the more the rack has a tendency to sway.
Ultimately, you should put thought into any rack design.  Think through the tasks that you will be doing most often, the tasks that are prone to mistakes/errors or can affect other connections, the amount of space you have, your budget and any other considerations the job/site may have.
"
cisco - Website filtering via IOS,"
A poor man's filter can be implemented by using NBAR to match the URL you want to block and then drop the traffic that matches.
For instance if you wanted to block google you could use the following
class-map match-any BlockGoogle
    match protocol http url *.google.*

policy-map BlockGoogle
   class BlockGoogle
       drop

interface gig 0/1
    description WAN Interface
    ip address 4.2.2.1 255.255.255.252
    service-policy output BlockGoogle

Because this is a match-any class map you can just add more URLs to match in the class.
Note: Matching based on URL will need to be done in the 1921, not the L2/3 switch.
"
"ipv4 - How do the Application, Presentation and Session layers of the OSI model map to TCP/IP's Application Layer and vice versa?","
Yes. Both of the OSI and TCP/IP models are pretty old at this stage, and the TCP/IP model was created more specifically to ""operate"" with the IP protocol suite (the TCP/IP model slightly predates the OSI model). The OSI model was created by the ISO (International organization) and TCP/IP model was created by the U.S. and is maintained by the IETF. Even if TCP/IP didn't turn out to be the predominant protocol suite used on the Internet as we know it, with things like Moore's law and increasingly complex applications/protocols that can span multiple layers, the OSI model is becoming somewhat obsolete.
The reason why layers 7, 6 and 5 are all crammed into the Application layer in the TCP/IP model is that the folks that created the TCP/IP model believed that those responsibilities should be handled by the application itself, rather than within neatly laid out abstraction layers (thus helping to ease potential confusion that your question calls out).

"
cisco - Does 2504 WLC support LAG?,"
Yes, the 2504 supports LAG in v7.4.  Your first guide refers to v7.0.116.0 and the second guide written in 5/2013 implies v7.4.  Enabling LAG requires a reboot of the WLC and has limitations similar to the 5500.

When LAG is enabled on a WLC, the WLC forwards data frames on the same port on which they were received. The WLC relies on the neighbor switch to load-balance traffic across the EtherChannel. The WLC does not perform any EtherChannel load-balancing on its own.

Limitations/Restrictions, same as 5500 but note 5508 doesn't have ap-manager inf's:


LAG requires the EtherChannel to be configured for 'mode on' on both
  the controller and the Catalyst switch. 
The load-balancing method configured on the Catalyst switch must be a
  load-balancing method that terminates all IP datagram fragments on a
  single controller port. Not following this recommendation may result
  in problems with access point association. 
The recommended load-balancing method for Catalyst switches is src-dst-ip (enter the
  port-channel load-balance src-dst-ip command). 
With LAG, all of the controller ports need to connect to the same neighbor switch. If the neighbor switch goes down, the controller
  loses connectivity.  With multiple AP-manager interfaces, you can
  connect your ports to different neighbor devices. If one of the
  neighbor switches goes down, the controller still has connectivity.
  However, using multiple AP-manager interfaces presents certain
  challenges when port redundancy is a concern. 
Port mirroring is not supported when link aggregation (LAG) is enabled on the controller.

How to find a duplicate router-id ospf in the network?,"
If you have access to config repositories, the best way to do this is to search through them all to find duplicate entries. Assuming you're on a *NIX host, you could do something like:
$ cat * | grep 'router-id' | awk {'print $2'} | sort | uniq -c

You want to look for anything that has a '2' in the first column. You can then find the offender and grep for the IP to find the routers that it's configured on. This would likely be the simplest way. You're already on the right track with a Perl script to poll the devices via SNMP to get at the router-id IP addresses, but I will say that SNMP code can be a little ""hairier"" than just simply using Net::SSH::Expect or Net::Appliance::Session to just log into the devices and dump the running configs to filehandles (at which point you can use the technique above).
Assuming you're running Cisco, there's also a fairly comprehensive troubleshooting guide that covers this topic if you're interested.
"
cisco - Setting up DHCP server on the router or on the switch?,"
Since DHCP Discovery broadcasts initially and to avoid the need for ip-helper addresses, the L3 switch where your users or servers connect is generally the better spot for DHCP.  You didn't mention multiple VLANs, and with the size equipment you have, I assumed just one, so you just need DHCP configured for that VLAN.
You could put the DHCP scope on your router if it's L2 adjacent to the users.  If it isn't, then you need ip-helper config in your L3 switch VLAN to get the DHCP broadcasts sent unicast to the router (DHCP server).
Edit: With your update on topology and VLANs, I would still lean toward the L3 switch for the location of your DHCP scopes.  With the router failing, no DHCP discovery or renewal could take place which could impact your internal-only traffic.
Ideally, you have multiple switches or DHCP servers so you can have distinct scopes on them -- not overlapping, each serving half of the addresses.  On a 172.16.1.0/24 subnet, and skipping the first 4 addresses, one server could scope 172.16.1.4-127/24 and the other server 172.16.1.128-254/24.  [172.16.1.1 reserved for your gateway addr with .2 and .3 reserved if you were running HSRP]

switching - 802.3x ethernet flow-control on user ports?,"
Most often Cisco devices can only receive PAUSE frames. They can't send them.
If you are running storage over your network I can understand why you would be looking at implementing it and some server/storage vendors even recommend you to do so.
Note however that PAUSE frames is a very blunt tool as it can pause all traffic meaning you can't differentiate between packets. That means your high priority packets will be treated the same as low priority packets. If you run a separate storage network then it's no issue and you can safely enable it.
There is a standard 802.1Qbb that enables to send PAUSE frames per class so not all the traffic gets paused.
This article describes how 802.3x works and the implications of running it like adding delay to RTT for TCP packets and such.

You don't need to do it so complex way as there is no implied $, so this should suffice:

But this probably is not even doing what you want to do, are you really interested in the order? I don't think BGP enforces any particular ordering in communities, RFC1997 just allows manipulation without specifying order. And Cisco seems to order communities in numerical order in presentation (neighbor sends me community 1:42 3:42, I add 2:42 and communities shown are '1:42 2:42 3:42' instead of what you maybe expect '1:42 3:42 2:42'.
That is, your denying of community 65000 in the beginning probably does not work. If you explain your application, maybe better solution can be found.
When it comes to communities in different platform, what @Teun implied is that they are quite different. Juniper had brilliant idea to use ASN as atom in their as-path regexp, normally atom is character (or byte, if you don't support UTF8). Juniper solution is clearly superior solution, if you think about character classes, say you want to match private ASN in JunOS, simple as [64512-65534]. If atom is normal character, like in IOS and Quagga, it's much more awkward.

cisco - What is the meaning of RSSI?,"
RSSI is a Radio-Frequency (RF) term and stands for Received Signal Strength Indicator. It is a measure of the power level that a RF device, such as WiFi or 3G client, is  receiving from the radio infrastructure at a given location and time. For instance, the power level a laptop is detecting from a nearby AP. 
Usually, the higher the RSSI the better the quality and speed of the communication through the radio segment.

cisco - Migrating from PIX/VPN 3000 to ASA,"
Regarding question 1 on mobile device licensing
Per your comment below, I did a couple tests on our ASA5525-X which has Essentials/Mobile licenses. I was indeed able to limit access using Dynamic Access Policies. I setup a test policy allowing only iOS devices on iPad2,7 models to connect in a new policy. Then I setup the default policy to terminate sessions. This worked and allowed my Verizon iPad Mini to connect but not my iPhone. Here is the license breakdown:
Session Type: AnyConnect

Username     : <user>                 Index        : 40
Assigned IP  : 10.10.121.1            Public IP    : 70.194.2.165
Protocol     : AnyConnect-Parent SSL-Tunnel DTLS-Tunnel
License      : AnyConnect Essentials, AnyConnect for Mobile
Encryption   : AnyConnect-Parent: (1)none  SSL-Tunnel: (1)RC4  DTLS-Tunnel: (1)AES128
Hashing      : AnyConnect-Parent: (1)none  SSL-Tunnel: (1)SHA1  DTLS-Tunnel: (1)SHA1
Bytes Tx     : 3200                   Bytes Rx     : 940
Group Policy : anyconnect-split-policy
Tunnel Group : anyconnect-split-group
Login Time   : 11:46:24 EDT Fri Jun 7 2013
Duration     : 0h:01m:52s
Inactivity   : 0h:00m:00s
NAC Result   : Unknown
VLAN Mapping : N/A                    VLAN         : none

Note: When configuring these settings, if you don't have the ""Apply"" button highlight afterwards, you will need to do something in ASDM that will activate the button and allow you to click it. None of the DAP settings for AnyConnect specifics would apply automatically nor trigger the Apply button so I could apply the settings. I had to go modify another setting, click apply, modify the setting back, click apply. This was using ASDM 7.1 on a 9.1.2 ASA5525-X.
Regarding question 2 on the licensing:
There are no client-side licensing options that I am aware of. The only license not necessarily tied to the ASA directly is the AnyConnect Premium which may be pulled off of a ""server"" ASA with a pool of session licenses for multiple ""client"" ASAs. In the end, they're applied to an ASA still.

cisco - Setting the same gateway address at a DR site as our main site,"
from the sounds of it, you should be able to do it without much of an issue. This is simply because of the NATing that you have going on.
A bit of a warning, if the servers are all have static IPs and default gateways, changing the IP of the firewall (current gateway), may make it harder to reach the servers, as they won't know how to get to 192.168.53.0/24 without the default gateway.
One way to mitigate this, is to create a static route on one server that points to 192.168.10.10 for traffic going to 192.168.53.0/24.
Another way would be to create a new NAT rule on the ASA for an individual host on the main site. Then on the ASA at the DR site, NAT this again to be on the same subnet as the servers.
Say, host 192.168.10.50 is NAT'd to 192.168.54.254, then pushed over the VPN. The DR ASA then NATs this again to change the source to 192.168.10.254. When the servers at the DR see this source IP, they'll know how to respond since it's in the same subnet.
"
ipv4 - Does SCTP work over the Internet?,"
SCTP generally works and no special support is needed, as you implied it is just payload to IP packets.
Certainly someone is blocking specific IP protocols (considering how many FW guys think ICMP should be blocked), but that would be exception rather than rule, generally speaking all IP protocols work just fine.
Quick test on nlnog ring with hping3 -c 1 -n  194.100.40.53 -0 --ipproto 132 from about 210 boxes resulted 59 packets delivered, so only 59/210 worked in real-life test.
I've never heard of actual transit provider filtering IP protocols, so it's the enterprise FW protecting the LAN which usually is the culprit. As long as you control the ends of the Internet connection you should be fine.

"cisco - Difference between MSC-A, MSC-B and FP-40","
MSC-B draws a little more power than MSC-A, but they are similar in functionality.
The FP40 doesn't have as much buffering as the MSC cards, and it doesn't have the top-end PPS switching speed that the MSC cards do.

cisco - How does one specify certain IPs or MAC addresses for NBAR policy enforcement?,"
You could create a second match condition in the class-map matching all source IP networks you want to block (with an ACL). Any requests to youtube.com from a source IP not matched by this ACL will not be dropped.
"
load balance between two ISP bgp links,"
You didn't mention vendor, but if Cisco IOS, you can use:
router bgp 43792
  bgp bestpath as-path multipath-relax
  address-family ipv4
    maximum-paths 2
  !
!

multipath-relax is needed as normally you'll only multipath with same as-path routes.
I'm personally strongly against carrying default routes via dynamic routing-protocols, there simply isn't any need, as long as you operate platform which supports recursive static routes.
Consider your operator router gets disconnect from their core, then you still receive the default route and your traffic is blackholed until you manually intervene. However if they'd send you some candidate route, perhaps their own PA block or maybe few PA blocks crucial to you, you could add static default routes towards these networks, if edge box is disconnected from core, the aggregate network is gone, and you can converge without manual intervention.
"
wireless - Where to properly put the DHCP server?,"
We handle them on the same server. If the server is not in the same VLAN/Network as the clients, you can use dhcp relay on the layer3 device (normally the gateway) of said network.
For example, if you have wireless going to vlan 10, wired vlan 15, and your server is on vlan 20; you'll configure the dhcp relay agent on vlans 10 and 15 interfaces to point to the server's IP address on vlan 20.
In cisco terms, the dhcp relay agent is enabled by the ip helper-address $serverIP address.
NOTE: ip helper-address is more than a dhcp relay agent. It can be used for other protocols as well. Info here: http://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=330807&seqNum=9

You need a Layer-3 capable device to route between VLANs. This can be a L3-capable switch though, it doesn't have to be a separate router.

routing - Isolating Juniper Management Plane,"
This can easily turn into a debate, sure you could do management in different logical-system, but what are the perceived gains? You're still going to need to protect the main instance just the same.
In my opinion you gain nothing but you add complexity, which means added risk of downtime.
It would be different matter on SUP2T or Nexus7k with CMP, where you truly have separate out-of-band interface available.
My recommendation would be to optimize for least complexity, do on-band ssh management via normal main instance and have RS232 (alas, necessary evil) as back-up out-of-band.
If you go through this route, it'll work, there will be some inconveniences like copying software, but you can cope with it, with 'set cli logical-system MGMT'
You need two solution, one for normal day-to-day work, and another for OOB, when system or network is broken. OOB is easy, you need RS232, as RS232 is only solution you can use, to try to reboot box when junos is not running or unresponsive (set system debugger-on-break).
For your main day-to-day work, it's more debatable, you have three options:

use on-band (same routes as production INET)
use routing-instance (you'll get routing separation, but use same copy of RPD, but I guess you're using FXP0, which is not supported here)
use logical-system, another copy of RPD is ran just for MGMT

You mentioned need to have symmetric route. I assume from this, that you want to use FXP0 for MGMT and you have another competing route for return traffic,  which you need, as NMS server network is used for something else than just NMS, which is bit worrying.
In my opinion FXP0 is simply not needed, as it's not OOB (like CMP is) you cannot even protect FXP0 port via FW filter, as it's not HW interface.  
But if we assume that you want to keep using FXP0 then you indeed pretty-much MUST put it in logical-system, even if you didn't have competing route for NMS, you'd still need to put FXP0 in logical-system, otherwise you expose your NMS network to attacks from the on-band, which you cannot protect, as you cannot put HW FW filter in the FXP0 interface.

I would use vlan-based policing which works better on these switches. This is an example matching a speed value of 48Mb

 mls qos vlan-based

!
policy-map VLAN500_PARENT
 class class-default
  set dscp default
  service-policy VLAN500_POLICE
!
interface Vlan500
 service-policy input VLAN500_PARENT

Under the parent policy you have to 'set' something in order for it to work. This could be anything so in this example I'm simply setting the dscp to 0
