Should meta.stackoverflow.com replace uservoice.com?,"
Definitely Yes.
Counting votes in favor/against a feature/bug does not a web application make.

SO already has the userbase.
SO can track votes 1-per-user on question/answers.
The status of change requests can be conveyed by tags/editing, etc. 

In short: SO > UV
"
Should StackOverflow support more than 2 openids per account?,"
I don't think this is the right solution.
The problem is that certain OpenID providers (most notably, Google, and often Yahoo unless you have set up a named OpenID) use per-domain hashes as their OpenID strings.
Thus,
  https://www.google.com/accounts/o8/id?id=aitoawlsz5_hewdpvee74euceg0aiysm2uq2rar
versus
  http://username.openid.com
This means it is effectively impossible to identify anyone on two different sites using their OpenID, if they choose a provider that uses this same strategy.
We could add 50 different OpenIDs per user, but

I don't want to force users to have multiple OpenIDs for our convenience.
Even if you do, you're avoiding the real core problem: what are viable ways to identify the ""same"" user on two websites, when the user only uses a Google OpenID?

update: we now have a reasonable workaround in place, which is to demand email from Google GMail OpenIDs.
update: I changed my mind and support this due to the proliferation of email addresses, since email = identity. You can now have an unlimited # of credentials (email or URL) associated with your account at the network level.

"How about a separate private ""bounty points"" *alongside* your public ""reputation points""?","
I disagree.  I happen to have a high (but not ungodly high) amount of Rep - over 10K.  And I ask very few questions (I google a lot first).  
If my public rep wasn't affected by putting a bounty on questions, I would put a bounty on every question I ask - to get more interest in it.  My ""bounty rep stash"" would go down, but not drastically decrease, and would probably stay somewhat even with the rate I ask questions.  
This is just an example using myself as an example, but I bet it applies to others as well.  Letting me do this defeats the point of bounties - I need to really feel the sacrifice to give bounties meaning.  Otherwise you'll see a huge upswing in bounties and questions without them won't get as much attention.
"
Should a user have only one account on all SO/ServerFault/Meta sites,"
SO / SF reputation scores are measuring different things, because they have different topic focus (programming vs. sysadmin). Super User reputation is also measuring something different.
And so is participation here, technically.
We can see the desire to sync the contents of your profile (website, email, about me, etc), but not the reputation score.
"
Search for users per (part of) OpenID,"
OpenID is kind of a semi-private bit of information, though.
This is sort of like asking to search for someone by their login name -- all you need is the password to complete the puzzle.
We do use parts of the openid to identify the user (not the whole thing, but parts) when the user gives us nothing else to go on.
"
Should the beta badges stop being awarded to users?,"
Yes!  The sanctity of the Beta Badge is sullied!  Stop this badge inflation now!
An example user 155.  He didn't rank a beta badge until very recent activity (mid-June), when he was awarded a beta badge! 
Sign up in early September, answer almost nothing...leave for six months, and when you return to a production site and start posting again, you still get the Beta badge!
This means that over 1000 badges have been awarded to folks who where not active enough during the beta period to earn one, like us Original Hardcore 2982 SOpedians.

2982 forever!

Bhind th curtain - Mta Stack Exchang,"
Jeff and Jarrod posted self-deprecating answers, but as an outsider, let me tell you that the database code and schema are really tight.  (And I should add that has absolutely nothing to do with me, hahaha.)  If you're going to scale a SQL Server database fast to a large audience at a low cost, you don't want any extraneous business logic in the database.  No triggers, no UDFs, no CLR code, no record-by-record operations.
Normally when I do performance tuning for clients, I start tracing queries with a duration of more than 10 seconds.  At Stack Overflow, I have to crank my filters down to 150-200 ms just to see any activity. It always gives me a grin.
Just generally speaking, application servers are cheap, and SQL Server is expensive ($5k-$25k per CPU).  Even if you use open source databases, it's easier to scale application servers than it is to scale database servers.  Every added web/application server is relatively easy to implement with a load balancer - every added database server, not so much.  Every time you have to do anything even remotely CPU-related, do it in the web/application tier, not the database tier.

What about meta-meta Stack Exchange?,"
http://blag.xkcd.com/2008/01/14/robot9000-and-xkcd-signal-attacking-noise-in-chat/

The big problem we ran into, actually, was meta-discussion overwhelming the channel. Every new person wanted to speculate about the rules and their effect, and every violation was followed by a long postmortem. At first, we had a scoreboard showing who was the best at talking without violation, but this quickly turned into a competition, destroying actual chat. When we took down the scoreboard and banished meta-discussion of the channel to #meta-discussion, everything worked out nicely. (And, of course, for discussion of the concept of #meta-discussion people had to go to #meta-meta-discussion, and for chat about how silly that whole idea was, we created #meta-meta-meta-discussion …)

How relevant is rep and community wiki on meta-stackoverflow,"
Jeff goes over part of this in the blog:


bounties make little sense on a discussion site



wording needs to be tweaked (i.e. questions->topics, answers->replies)
need to be able to follow questions/get notices of additional replies
remove notion of community wiki, as discussion sites have a stronger sense of ownership, plus nothing will be off-topic
ensure that chronological ordering is the default, if not the only, sort order, both for replies and comments
remove accepting an answer
some of the close reasons will have to be removed or tweaked


We’ve made a few of the easier changes already that were based on (groan) meta-data. Others will be tougher. We won’t know until we try, so …

I honestly feel that because reputation does not matter here, we should have our SO reputation linked over to here and not be able to get any reputation off of questions on this site. After all, your StackOverflow reputation is relevant here because this is a site about StackOverflow. That's my take.
"
Is the fastest gun in the west solved?,"
I had an idea for this that I submitted to uservoice a while ago, but I can't seem to find it now so I'll recreate it:
When casting a vote, the effect of that vote would be delayed for all other users for five minutes or something. You would be able to see the vote effect, so that you could easily confirm that your vote was actually cast. But everybody else would see the effect of that vote five minutes later.
This would allow each answer to be voted on its own merit, at least for the first few minutes. From the point of view of a user, the site would appear to work exactly the way it does now except it would look like everybody else was off having a coffee break whenever you cast a vote.
"
Can I find out which tags I have created?,"
Having recently won a Taxonomist badge, totally by surprise, I'd love to know which if any tag I've created.
I looked at my list of 373 tags, where I can only see 50. I can't identify a single one in which I owned the earliest question. The closest I saw was Lucene, and I know that wasn't me.
I don't think the information would cause gaming. I think gaming type users would easily just make a pen-and-paper list of tags they know they created.
"
What should we do about questions marked correct that have obviously incorrect answers?,"
First of all, if the original poster of the question felt that this answer fixed his problem. He has the right to accept it (be it wrong or not).
Secondly there are cases where the original poster is just going in the wrong direction with his question and the community votes some answer that rectifies his trouble in a way he is not looking for (and then voting for it immensely) But he can still accept any answer he wants.
The thing is that an accepted answer is necessarily not the correct one. It's just the one the OP wanted.
So I think we shouldn't do anything about this. This is a system to help others, the OP can accept a solution but we as a community can show our support for the answer we think is right and it will be the 2nd one after the accepted one.

"
Can we transfer questions from SO to meta?,"
I expect that this will eventually be possible, just as it's possible to transfer between SO and SF.

If there's anything that anybody wants to see added to make it more clear about where the real data lives, let me know and I'll be happy to implement it.  I'm never going to show the question content or answer content on SPWho2 because I don't want to distract the search engines.  Every author page and question name links back to Stack Overflow.
I also created wiki articles about importing & analyzing the StackOverflow export over at SQLServerPedia.

Can you bring the color back to meta?,"
I am open to tweaking some of the parameters, but the greyscale is here to stay.
Aren't all discussion sites just shades of grey, anyway? (rimshot)

All of the Oz sequences were filmed in three-strip Technicolor. The opening and closing credits, as well as the Kansas sequences, were both filmed in black and white and colored in a sepia tone. Publicity for the film mentioned the Technicolor but not the black-and-white or sepia, thus making it sound as if the entire film had been made in color.
Sometimes color and sepia would be juxtaposed in the film within seconds of each other. At one point, Dorothy sees her Aunt Em on the Wicked Witch of the West's crystal ball; she is then replaced by a vision of the Witch. Aunt Em appears only in sepia-toned black-and-white, while the Witch appears in the crystal ball in full Technicolor.

"Noob questions, simple answers, and big rep points","
rep points kinda remind me of that whole ""Zen and the Art of Archery"" business. I've gotten caught in that trap of reputation-score-addiction once or twice: poring over questions over and over until I answer one that gets upvoted. It's not worth it.

Should Combined Flair be offered?,"
Yes, I was just discussing this with someone else. I like the idea of being able to see multiple account details in one place much more than transferred or combined rep. The numbers represent slightly different things, after all.

"
"How about a ""Vote not to close"" option to counter the ""Vote to close""?","
I am definitively in favor of that process.
By the time the 5 ""close"" votes are here, not enough people are still looking at the question to care to vote for reopening, even if they wanted to at the time where closing votes were being (slowly) set.
Of course, it has been proposed ""numerous"" time on UserVoice already:

Currently, the ""Add anti-close votes"" is ranked 6th, with 179 votes.  
Before that, ""add ""stay open"" / ""stay close"" links"", marked as ""duplicated"", with the comment ""numerous duplicates"", but without ever mentioning one single similar request.


Note: since 2014-05-13 (""When did I get close-vote superpowers?""), users with a gold badge in a tag for a question can immediatly reopen a question closed as duplicate.
This is a (very small) improvement, which doesn't address the initial issue: there is no way to be notified when a question get (finally) closed in order to cast one's own reopen vote.
As I commented before, notification is really broken or non-existent on Stack Exchange sites.
(That is why I have almost 8000 ""favorite"" questions, in a desperate attempt to catch some of the events which can change the questions I have answered to)
... and ""close"" events aren't detected anyway, even when you ""favorite"" a question.

Are people too miserly with up votes?,"
I think people are pretty free with the up votes.  My own analyis has show an up to down vote ratio starting at 10 last fall and growing to about 12 now.

Are there better alternatives to closing questions?,"
I too find it a little strange that Jeff said that a closed question is a question on its way to deletion, yet Joel stated that he wants each question asked in every way possible.

Many times questions can be specialized instead of being closed.   This doesn't always apply though.  
2 questions may have the same subject, and 99% of the people think they are the same.  But the body of the question is asking slightly different things.  In these cases specializing the subject to make it clear about the distinction in each question is better.
"
Is Stack Overflow a business success?,"
2022 Answer
As of 2022, Stack Overflow has its ""Teams"" product, which is a private version of Stack Overflow for organizations.
It has also been purchased by Prosus (a Venture Capital firm; though this acquisition feels more ""private equity""-ish).
How do they make money today? Teams, and Ads in the form of normal ads and Employer Branding.  Is that money enough?  That's wholly unclear since it's now in private hands that aren't as forthcoming about their revenue and designs as the original founders were.
Talent (as we knew it) is gone. Careers (as we knew it) is gone.
The original answer is still relevant in its broad strokes; but going forward I anticipate we'll see more direct monetization attempts.
Original Answer (2009)
Stack Overflow as a business model is highly dependent upon its advertising model -- which is directly related to the value of advertising on the internet.
In an effort to branch out from this dependency, They've released the ""Stack Exchange"" product as well as careers.stackoverflow.com and jobs.stackoverflow.com.
I'll discuss each in turn.
Advertising: The tried-and-true business model of the internet. In times of recession, ad-revenue is down across the board, but it's still the lowest friction way to make money.  It requires the least resources from a business perspective.
Stack Exchange: This one puzzles me.  I don't know if Stack Overflow LLC licenses the Stack Overflow source code to FogCreek (which would seem to make the most 'legal' sense since they are two separate entities) or if they 'sold' it outright.  Or, as a third alternative, they have a business agreement that allows for a split of the revenues and they promise to share the improvements to the source code model.
The main problem with Stack Exchange is that it is an unproven business model.  How many 'pay for private knowledge exhcange' sites do you know of?  The cost is also subject to change.  If they charge too much, they make too little, but if they don't charge enough, they don't make nearly as much.  It's also dependent upon how the people that use it either monetize it, or write it off as a business expense.  The latter depends upon Stack Exchange bringing some sort of business value that justifies the expense.  Only time will tell.
Jobs:  As Joel points out the jobs board brought about 1 million in revenue in its first year.  I can only assume it brings in more now -- and with Stack Overflow and its sister sites, I'm sure Stack Overflow LLC gets a cut of that revenue as well.
Careers: The first effort by Stack Overflow LLC that doesn't seem dependent on Fog Creek support (even the monetization of Stack Exchange requires Fog Creek support, as Aaron is a Fog Creek employee).  It requires that developers and businesses pay to get a seemingly 'high quality' pool of applicants.  It deserves its shot; but I'm leery since it's trying something very new (charging applicants!).
Success is a subjective factor, but business success isn't.  Stack Overflow is able to pay three employees (not including the Ad guy) and cover its hosting cost.  It's currently the new hotness in the programming world.  Where else can you have Jon Skeet, Eric Lippert, Alan Kay, Joel Spolsky, Jason Cohen, Jeff Atwood, and many other 'rockstars' of our industry participate on a daily basis?  It sounds like hero worship, but the quality they bring is immeasurable.  It's an exciting time to be a developer.

Encouraging people to explain downvotes,"
The comments are there for people who want to explain their downvotes.
The only thing I can think of is an AJAX <div> reminder for users when they cast downvotes:


Please consider adding a comment if you think this post can be improved.

After the first downvote, we can't say we didn't remind them, and honestly that's as good as it gets. Forcing a comment will end in even worse results.
edit: this is now status-completed and live for users with reputation below 2000. It is shown on every downvote until you get to 2k.
"
Why should I upvote a question?,"
I will upvote a question if:

It is clear and well-written, including sample code where appropriate, useful tags etc. Ideally it should indicate that a certain amount of thought has gone into the question too, e.g. ""these are approaches I've already tried, but they don't work because of X, Y, Z.""
It is a non-trivial question which tackles a common source of misunderstanding (e.g. ""pass by reference"" vs ""pass reference by value"")

I very rarely downvote questions though - I usually add a comment or vote to close instead.
I've blogged in more detail about why I vote one way or another, if you want to know more...

Hopefully not.
Talking endlessly about the site and repping like a WoW gold farmer doesn't mean squat when you're in the other box and that rep is focussed on programming knowledge. 
Even at any kind of exchange rate, the level of trust that builds up in the number next to your avatar should correlate to the time and involvement you expend on that particular site.
"
Should downvoting cost you rep?,"
Personally I think that when a post is deleted by moderator or the community that any downvotes for it should be refunded back to the users who gave them. That would make the system fair. Normal downvotes should cost even a nominal amount of rep (which 1 rep is) to discourage their abuse. But, for me, the rep cost of downvoting a spam/offensive question means I just don't other than voting to close and/or flagging, as appropriate.
After all, what's the point of paying rep to downvote someone on 1 rep who is no doubt a throwaway account anyway?
"
Is the taxonomist badge really needed?,"
No, coming up with ""c' as a badge is so obvious I'm not sure why it justifies a silver badge. What's more, it leads to people mass tagging answers with new tags they create just to get this badge. We've had issues with this in the past. IMHO Taxonomist not only adds nothing, it's actually detrimental.

How about newlines within comments?,"
This is particularly relevant when one comment is being used to reply to more than one other comment, for example:

@Foo: Yes, that's certainly a problem. Will edit.
@Bar: No, ""pass by reference"" and ""pass reference by value"" aren't the same thing.
@Baz: You should definitely be using Joda Time.

That's a lot easier to read (IMO) than:

@Foo: Yes, that's certainly a problem. Will edit.
  @Bar: No, ""pass by reference"" and ""pass reference by value"" aren't the same thing.
  @Baz: You should definitely be using Joda Time.

Personally I'd like a few other bits of markdown to be available in comments, but I know Jeff wants to discourage more significant comments - it ends up leading to discussion rather than Q&A. Personally I like discussion, but it's Jeff's prerogative :)
"
Should there be anonymous answers (and questions)?,"
Great idea -- should be an option for both poster and reader.
Poster/answerer should be able to remain anonymous as an option, and change that option.
Reader should be able to set an option to, by default, not show names of posters/answerers.  Maybe a global default setting, with mouse-over to reveal specific names when they really want to see.
"
Should users answer homework questions?,"
Yes:
When the user has stated that it is homework and what issues they are having with it, and it shows that they have done the basic background work.  The benefits of getting answers on SO are that you have some indication of reliability of the answers and you also get varying viewpoints all together.
e.g. Why is this particular algorithm O(nlogn), when it looks like O(n^2)?
No:
When the question is poorly worded, they have done no background work or they haven't even indicated that they have started to understand the problem.
e.g. Tell me the difference between an apple and an orange?
So basically, the rules are the same as for any other good SO question!
"
What is a reasonable way to articulate in the question that answers need to revolve around the legacy language?,"
I think this is one specific example of a more general rule:
If your question has an ""obvious"" answer which you can't use for some valid reason, state that in the question.
If any answer ignores that part of the question, downvote it. The possible grey area would be when an answer explains why your restriction makes the question impossible to answer, or when it suggests a way of working round your original reason for avoiding the obvious answer.
"
Monitoring Stack Exchange sites of interest to me,"
Sorta kinda.  Check out this Yahoo Pipes example for StackOverflow done by Sam Hasler.  You can click View Source under the pipe and modify it for your own needs.  In the String Builder box, you can customize it to match just the tags you want to search on, and then clone the pipe.  You can build 3 different pipes - one for each site, each monitoring the tags you want - and then subscribe to the results via an RSS reader or with email alerts.

Answr Ordring - Mta Stack Exchang,"
Personally I always view answers in the sort order of ""newest first"". I like the idea of using rep as a tie-breaker when sorting by votes, but personally I'd order it the other way round. High rep users already have the benefit of name recognition - I think display order should try to mitigate that rather than exacerbating it.
"
How should a questioner indicate they want links to documentation?,"
Have your questions specifically said ""I'd love to RTFM, but I can't find the relevant bit of the docs - links would be very welcome!"" This feels like it's another symptom of this more general issue.
Sometimes answerers won't read questions carefully, admittedly - I know I've been guilty of that on multiple occasions - but at least if you have requested documentation (and potentially explained how you've tried to find it) it's reasonable to disregard and possibly downvote answers which ignore that.

"
Meaning of downvotes in Meta vs Main sites?,"
Now that Meta Stack Exchange is the only Meta site that maintains a separate reputation, I thought that this question should be revisited.
The problem with Meta-rep is this: while reputation doesn't mean the same thing on a regular site as MSE, it still affects what you can do on the site. Downvotes take reputation and upvotes give it. But reputation is still how you get privileges. And that's a problem.
At this moment, I've got about 970 MSE rep. If I post a number of suggestions that I see as perfectly valid, but the people on MSE don't want to see adopted, I lose a lot of rep. It's not necessarily that the ideas are bad; all it would take is that they were not… accepted among the community. And thus, simply by adding ideas to the site, I'm pushed farther away from greater privileges.
Indeed, there have been some MSE conversations that I've been reluctant to even consider bringing up, in part for these reasons. Questions about what forums are, what SE is, whether forums still have a place in a post-SE world, how best SE-style sites should build a community, the nature of a SE-based community vs. a forum, etc. My views on these issues would certainly be … controversial and in some ways antithetical to the prevailing wind of the people on MSE.
So if I were to talk about them, I lose rep. Not because I'm right or wrong, but simply because of the general feelings of the collective of people on MSE.
And that would be fine… if rep didn't give me abilities. The ability to create tags, to cast close votes, to see the up/down votes on a question/answer, unreviewed edits, etc.
For regular SE sites, reputation is a relative measure of the actual worth of the person. A person who has high rep has contributed significantly to the site. And thus, this person is more deserving of powers over the site. On MSE, this is not the case.
So my suggestion is this: leave the rep the same, but make MSE privileges based on the privileges you have for the highest rep site on your account. Since MSE is effectively shared (it's the default discussion place for Stack Exchange), it makes sense that being a member in good standing for any Stack Exchange site would transfer over. So if you are a 10,000 rep user of Super User, you would have the same privileges on MSE.

Adding incntiv for diting - Mta Stack Exchang,"
I think there is already sufficient encouragement to get people to edit posts.

People edit because they earned that ability (sufficient reputation to allow editing).
There is a badge awarded for editing a certain number of post.
Recognition - The post is marked as ""edited"" and tagged with their name.
Some people just find an intrinsic reward by helping out and adding to the site.

There are currently over 1,800 people with ""editor"" status on StackOverflow. I just feel that the developers have struck a good balance... a sufficient incentive to provide an appropropriate amount of editing. I would hate to see an ""over-incentive"" for people to over-zealously mangle other people's posts. The overall quality of posts I see here is uncharacteristically high.

"When the answer to a question exists on another site, what is the proper way to respond","
My usual practice is to link to the resource but either quote a short but relevant section (e.g. the ""remarks"" section of an MSDN page) or praise it. Creating a verbatim copy of a large amount of text is only good in the face of the resource being removed - which I suspect isn't going to happen for MSDN .NET documentation, Wikipedia or JavaDoc as three common examples. (I'm hoping the last MSDN re-org was the last for a while.) However, the document may very well be updated to become more accurate as time goes on. Copying more of a document than could reasonably be called ""fair use"" could run into legal issues, too.
Where possible add some extra value:

Explain how it's relevant to the specific question
Balance multiple points of view by referring to other documents
Give some sample code around the general point stated by the document

Rputation for commnts? - Mta Stack Exchang,"
Rather than 1 point for a single up-vote on a comment perhaps if it was 1 point (or 5 points) for 10 or more up-votes that might work.
Having said that, I'm not in favour of rep for comments. It would change how they were seen and used. They are there to ask for clarification etc. and as such can become obsolete and should be deleted. If they earned reputation people might post even more ""clever"" comments to try to earn that reputation.
I'd only go for it if there were a really convincing argument that it would work.

What about th IRC channl? - Mta Stack Exchang,"
While we're on the topic of IRC:
#SOMafia on irc.slashnet.org is NOT associated with Stack Overflow!
I've gotten several email complaints:

Yesterday, just out of curiosity, I joined #SOMafia on irc.shashnet.org and there was a JeffAtwood op there. If it wasn't you, then I'm sorry, please ignore this email, but if it was - what the hell man?
I understand I stumbled upon a private chatroom, and it's all fun and games, but I didn't expect to be called a ""flaming homosexual"" from someone like you, a man I admire and read his blog for several years. It was probably an inside joke with you guys, but still - not cool. I'm not going to pretend to be offended - I really could care less, but it was just juvenile.

another:

Please delete my accounts on all Trilogy sites including Meta. I am no longer interested in SO after the verbal abuse today on #somafia by JeffAtwood

another:

I am an avid reader of your blogs and recently I stumbled
  across #SOMafia IRC channel which had somebody who called himself as
  ""Jeff Atwood"" and abusing those who are entering the channel. At first
  I was shocked, then after some googling, I found
  What about the IRC channel?
  and realized that it was bogus. As one of the comments for your post
  pointed out, It would be nice to see some blog post from you
  pronouncing the channel as fake. Keep up the great work.

In general I never use IRC, so you can very safely assume if you see ""me"" on IRC it is not me.
Also: not cool.

Is there any point forcing a post to Community Wiki after 6 owner edits?,"
Personally, I'd rather that there was a vote-to-wiki that functioned like ""close"" etc; this would prevent the ugliness of people editing deliberately to force wiki, and avoid the accidental wiki you sometimes get by people tidying up a post
"
What should happen with a question that has both ignored and interesting tags,"
I prefer 'ignore' having precedence over 'interesting'.  I'd like to see every 'java' question, but I don't need to see the 'fun, offtopic, not-programming-related, java' questions.
"
Theoretical question: Hide rep above 10k?,"
Reputation does three things. 

It controls the access you have on the site.
It shows the reader of the answer / question how highly the user is regarded in the community (one note though: high rep != good programmer and good programmer != high rep)
It gives the user a goal (like gamer points on XBOX), it has no real value but it gives an incentive to shoot for a higher goal. (even though past a certain point you get minimal value)

So hiding the reputation at all past 10k removes point 2 and 3. Hiding it from others lessens point 2.
For me I wouldn't like it, I'm in this for the game. I like challenging myself to try getting many upvotes for each answer and to get the reputation cap each day.
"
Whats Wikis questions and answers principles?,"
A Community Wiki is supposed to be a way to have a collection pot of information on some subject from the entire community.
So a CW does more things than you post. For example if you post an answer on a CW question and I edit this answer, your name will no longer appear. Since I am the last editor.
So any notion of ownership does not exist on a CW question.
Many users misunderstand CW's and many use them to ask subjective questions and prevent rep whoring on answers which many agree with. A CW question was not originally supposed to be about that.
"
Batch rtagging? - Mta Stack Exchang,"
Good news
This is now available as a moderator-only function, thanks (as always) to Jeff and the team.
So; if you have a need to merge two (or more) tags, please propose it here on ""meta"" (so it can be discussed etc), stating:

which site
which master tag (the one to keep)
which tag or tags to migrate and delete

and if appropriate it will enacted by a moderator
To reduce the scope for error, I would anticipate:

a grace period (to allow discussion/disagreement along the ""no they're very different"" lines)
a question back on the affected site (tagged with all the tags involved) along the lines of ""tag-merge proposed [link]: are these the same thing?"", so that the people who know those areas have visibility (the moderators can't necessarily be expected to know the area(s) well enough to directly approve/veto the merge)

"
What to do about old orphaned questions?,"
I expect a lot of these are casual users - i.e. not really invested in the site. They have their answer, they leave.
Accepting by proxy is... subjective, and I'm not sure it can be automated; and I'm not sure that the (few) moderators would want to invest hours each week doing this? I know on MSDN forums (over the weekend) they do a blitz on this (when I participated I would get the regular e-mail stack on a Monday morning); it must take ages, and they have more admins.
"
Why should 10k rep users view self-deleted answers?,"
This is nothing like email. You are posting info to a public forum, if anything it is more like  NNTP. In that regard the 'CABAL' of the NTP admins could view everything including deletes. Anyone who captured the post pre delete sees it too (one very good reason the admins have to be able to see the deletes if they need to).
It's public, deal with it or don't post.
Does SO even restrict bots like the Wayback Machine?
Responding to more of your comments:
You have no rights except attribution. Again if this is a problem for you don't post here. Designing a system that allows very easy posting of content basically requires the people running it to look at what happened after the event. Since in SO case the 'admin like' status of 10K users is made very clear (asnd is basically necessary, the sort of paid for moderation required to do it only via 'official' people is prohibitive) if you have a problem with said status of those people you just shouldn't post anything you might not want deleting.
"
Suggesting project ideas using Stackoverflow?,"
You have 12.4k - if it's important to you, post a question asking for it and throw in a bounty of 500. 
This, however, kind of sucks as you have to wait 48 hours or whatever until you are able to attach a bounty to a question. This doesn't seem particularly logical to me as sometimes you know it's something that requires a little work and you just want to put the bounty on there from the start. 
Hell, my top question was asking people to program a boggle solver and plenty of people threw their solutions in. I meant to add a bounty when I started the question, but the 48 hour limit made me forget about it until it was already pretty much over. I think I'll go ahead and add a bounty now...

"
Should the community wiki police be shut down?,"
Important change
End users can not mark questions wiki anymore, so the only appropriate way to get action on a question you believe really should be wiki, is to flag it for moderator attention.

A couple points..

Vote-to-wiki will not be implemented. When the answer to a problem is ""let's make things arbitrarily more complicated"", it is rarely the correct answer.
Do not bully users into community wiki. You can offer a carrot in the form of a comment that says ""wow, I'd love to vote this up if it was community wiki"" but downvoting and other nagging is not appropriate. (addendum: the community wiki flag checkbox is not shown for new users because they can't possibly understand it, you may potentially be nagging new users about a setting they don't even have.)
If you think something should be community wiki then flag it for mod attention with a comment to that effect. Simple.

Also, note that as of now the CW edit threshold has been reduced from 750 rep to 100 rep on all sites.

I agree the comments functionality does need looking at, I dont mind the ajax however instead of the response being table markup they should be using json and client side templates.

I'm leaving the offensive (15 rep) and downvote (100 rep) requirements, though.

"
Any way to send a personal message to another user?,"
Nope.
This has been suggested many, many times, going all the way back to the earliest days of the site. Prior to the creation of Meta SO, feature requests were posted on UserVoice:

Messaging between users


Declined without comment.


User messaging or wall

it's possible we might have some kind of messaging function later, so as not to expose emails but let users communicate. But it's low priority.



Comments were added to the system to allow users to communicate with each other in the context of a specific post.

Allow private messages


it's about the questions and answers, not social networking. But if you want to contact someone, check their profile -- they will provide an URL or email address there.


How do you send a message to a stackoverflow user?


Declined without comment

Later on, the system was expanded to allow notifying other users of comment-replies.
Even with the ability to communicate with other involved users in regards to a specific post, the requests kept on coming. When Meta Stack Overflow replaced UserVoice, the number of feature-requests exploded:

Private message system unlocked by reputation

Why don't we have instant messaging on Stack Exchange?

Is there a way to contact another member of stack overflow?

Is there plans for an IM Capability?

Request a specific expert on a subject to answer your question

Feature Request: ""WAKE UP and accept my answer please""

My Social Network Integration for Private Messaging, Commenting, Etc

how can I get in touch with a stackoverflow member privately?

Many, many more


The consistent response to this is that it's a bad idea, because:

It could hide information from the community: useful information transmitted privately is unavailable to other readers, subverting the core purpose of the site.

It could be used to harass other users (""Answer my question!"", ""Accept my answer!"", ""Yer momma so fat she overflows the stack!"", etc...)


However, there is some value in being able to communicate with other users outside the context of a specific question or answer. This point was conceded with the implementation of a chat system: users on every Stack Exchange site can create and participate in chat rooms, integrated with the normal user accounts. There are still no truly private messages between users, but for those who want to chew the fat or discuss whatever outside the confines of the sites themselves, this can provide a viable solution.
Finally, it became apparent that moderators occasionally need to contact users about sensitive topics, and relying on email for this created problems. So the ability for moderators to send a private message to another user was implemented. The use of these messages are heavily restricted, reviewed by the system administrators, and reserved for critical messages only.
For normal users, the advice remains: if you want others to be able to contact you privately, add basic contact info to your profile's bio page.

Etiquette of screen-scraping Stack Overflow,"
We have scripts that check for unusual / abusive access patterns, and a daily ""top n"" traffic summary report of inordinate and anomalous usage.
We regularly block (IP range ban) unknown scrapers that do not identify themselves and/or have poor behavior patterns. These bans are permanent until someone emails us to make a case that they should be removed.
If you don't want to get blocked, here's how:

Use GZIP requests. This is important! For example, one scraper used 120 megabytes of bandwidth in only 3,310 hits which is substantial. With basic gzip support (baked into HTTP since the 90s, and universally supported) it would have been 20 megabytes or less.

Identify yourself. Add something useful to the user-agent (ideally, a link to an URL, or something informational) so we can see your bot as something other than ""generic unknown anonymous scraper.""

Use the right formats. Don't scrape HTML when there is a JSON or RSS feed you could use instead. Heck, why scrape at all when you can download our cc-wiki data dump??

Be considerate. Pulling data more than every 15 minutes is questionable. If you need something more timely than that ... why not ask permission first, and make your case as to why this is a benefit to the SO community and should be allowed? Our email is linked at the bottom of every single page on every SO family site. We don't bite... hard.

Yes, you want an API. Now there is one! see http://stackapps.com for all the info you could possibly want, and more.

Wiki pags on Stack Exchang - Mta Stack Exchang,"
Jonathan, I completely agree. I requested that SO implement similar functionality some time back. There's simply too much knowledge on this site, and not enough organization. I'm with you on the fact that sometimes I don't want to learn from specific questions - I'd like to learn from a user-contributed documentation wiki. This is a proven method, and has seen great success in other areas. Taking into consideration the user-base of SO, their education, experience, and willingness to Edit, I can see this being a tremendous addition.

You can now edit your own comments after you post them, within a 5 minute window.

Scors on tag spcific badgs - Mta Stack Exchang,"

This was asked for a while back and Jeff replied that a query like that would be to heavy to be used regularly (by a user that is). Since you theoretically could see your score for every tag. (which goes through every tag and gets your upvotes)
Accepting an answer gives 15 in rep. It does not give an upvote. I think the query that asks for this information is slow enough than to slow it even further by calculating in accepted scores.

"
What level of notification should users have for questions they posted answers to (or left comments on)?,"
Normally, you only get notified of comments when you own the post.
You will now get notified of any comments that refer to you by @username in a comment, even if you do not own the post.
Rules:

Only applies to other people in the comments that you are commenting on. 
Response must include @username that you are referring to, where ""username"" is a reasonable match to the user's current display name (as seen in the comments above yours).
There must be a starts-with, case insensitive match of at least THREE characters to the displayname. So @a and @ab will never match anyone or anything.
Spaces cannot be used to match, so if the person's display name is ""Peter Smith"" then just use @peter to match.
Matching is performed in reverse chronological order, so if there are five people named ""John"" in the comments, writing ""hey @john, have you considered apples?"" will match the most recent John to comment.

"
What's the single biggest barrier to entry on Stack Overflow?,"
The number of different ""views"" can be unintuitive even to me who uses the site every day (for 20 days and counting - c'mon WOOT!)

Also the recent page is some time hard to find for new users.

Improvements to editor for formatting source code,"
One very simple one - when writing code, when we hit ""enter"" it would be really nice if it went to the same indent, i.e.
void Foo()
{
   if (foo) <- I'm about to hit enter here
 > | <- I would like the cursor to be positioned here

Another request - the Ctrl-K shortcut indents the code if any of it is at the first column, but outdents otherwise. It would be nice to have a shortcut to always indent, so it's easy to indent a whole block of code. (Usually I add an extra line with a character at the start, then select the whole block including the new line, hit Ctrl-K and then remove the extra line, but that's a pain.)
Oh, and finally: a shortcut key to display all the shortcuts as an overlay, like Google Reader does. (Press ""?"" in Google Reader to see what I mean.)

Why don't people upvote questions they answer?,"
My rule of thumb is that I upvote questions when I find them on Google when I look for a solution to a problem of mine - I upvote the answers that helped me and the question. It seems like other people do that as well because some of my questions / answers get upvotes even (almost) a year after they were asked / answered.
"
The problem with reputation: does high reputation attract too many upvotes?,"
I operated a second account for some time because I was curious to find  out whether low-reputation users are really treated much differently than high-reputation users. (Don't worry,  the sock puppet never even glanced at anything contributed by my main account.)
My - of course subjective - impressions from that were:

low-rep users get more scrutiny on their contributions. That scrutiny isn't always there for high-rep users - I have seen instances where blatantly incorrect contributions (either by me or other high-rep users) were blindly upvoted by the community.
if there are two identical contributions from a new and a veteran user, that of the veteran user is more likely to get upvoted.

However, I also found that 

if you make mistakes, they usually get pointed out. Whether you're a high or a low reputation user doesn't matter. The only difference is that with a high rep user, people may check twice before they say something.  
If you provide good content, you will gain upvotes, no matter how much reputation you have. Apart from the fact that high-rep users are more trusted, and viewed somewhat less critically, by the community, there is no discrimination against lower-reputation users.

I dare say that overall, the voting system works fairly. If you are competent and able to express your knowledge in an understandable way, there are fine chances of succeeding on Stack Overflow, no matter how big the ""establishment"" of veteran high-rep users is.

"The ""I Get It"" Reputation Problem","
As noted in a comment, the best solution is to edit the question to reflect the fact that your ideas have changed, and mark the answer that changed your mind as accepted. If you edit the question people will read and understand that you ""get it"", rather than continuing to believe that you don't.

Why are there no co-op jobs on Careers?,"
I would image that there are few internship/co-op positions listed because Fog Creek charges for the job placements. While the fee is justifiable for a company looking for a full-time, permanent savior, it makes much less economic sense for a short-term person.

Editing based on SO reputation,"
Keep participating over here and your rep will be high enough in short order to do the editing.  I'm sure if the SO team sees that after a bit people aren't getting enough rep quickly enough to do these things, they will lower the thresholds, but I just started answering questions and in one day got 150 rep.
You'll see a smaller community here, but probably much more active users.  Also there are a bunch of moderators on this site as well I believe who can take care of that role in the few weeks it takes people to build up rep.
"
Single location for SO/SF/SU user info,"
Tabbed browsing helps a lot. If you read the questions you have to open it separately anyway. Maybe I should mention that I have 20 browser windows open and each contains at least 4 tabs.
No, not all for SO ;-)
But I'm browsing that way all the time.

This is currently not a problem on SO (due to many current tags) But when hosted solutions and other SO sites pop up this could be even implemented as a feature for the moderators.

"
What to do about rep inflation?,"

Implement a rep decay mechanism, so that inactivity sheds some of the overall rep that's built up.

I think this was discussed on some SO Podcast and was decided that it was a bad idea.

Thousands of mods is fine. Carry on.

I think this is the idea, the idea is not that mods should be limited but that the system trusts users after x reputation. If it trusts a lot of people then that is great.
"
Are we going to be able to easily see the separate up-votes and down-votes on a post?,"
You should be able to see your Positive vs. Negative score on your questions and answers by looking at your Reputation graph. If you include your entire timeline, you should have the scores on the right side that show the Positive vs. Negative.
"
Can we have a books.stackoverflow.com?,"
Tom made a point about it being a good idea for a hosted version of StackOverflow, which I could agree with more if it was towards a wider range of topics/audiences. But a book review section which is devoted to programming books I could definitely see as a fun and useful sub-area of StackOverflow.com itself. The idea about Jeff & Joel working out a partnership with Amazon or other book dealers is great as well.
"
"Do 23,000+ tags need tag database editors?","
I think the SO team should internally make a small utility/page to merge/rename tags.

The activity tab on your profile/activity ( http://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/<number>/) has a RSS Feed. 

"
Is there a page that displays questions with zero answers?,"
No, there isn't. Unanswered used to be exactly that, but this way it was found that just one answer, even if not helpful at all, excluded the question from the list. It was much less likely to get answered again.
Maybe a threshhold would be interesting: show me unanswered questions with at most n answers.
Edit This was true at the time of writing. 
Now to find zero (0) answers, include the following in the search query: 

answers:0 

This will result in all questions with no answer. If you use another number, it shows all questions with a minimum of so many answers. (answers:1 returns all questions with at least one answer.)

There is a ""secret"" RSS feed, intended for bots which contains all new questions (it's used for sobot in the irc.freenode.net #stackoverflow channel), but I don't think it's publicised, so I'm hesitant to link to it.. If you really want it, I guess the best thing is to email the SO team (the ""contact us"" link in the footer)
There's obviously there is https://stackoverflow.com/feeds - but that's only ""popular"" questions.
There's a ""Planned"" Uservoice ticket ""Provide rss for all views  ""
One comment on that ticket mentions you can get a feed of all questions for a specific tag: https://stackoverflow.com/feeds/tag/scala
"
Accepting an answer should automatically upvote it as well,"
Since it is simple enough to cast an upvote and accept the answer, I don't a see a reason to constrain the user in this manner. I agree, I've never had a situation where I wasn't upvoting along with accepting. But, everyone has a different reason/rationale for upvoting, so I don't think the system should force that upvote.

Quantcast numbers vs. Google analytics numbers. Why the discrepancy?,"
IIRC Quantcast estimates the unique visitors from the users that are carrying their cookie information.

Uniques are a standard measure of audience size available from sophisticated analysis tools including Quantcast. Although many tools label them ""visitors,"" uniques technically count the distinct cookies received from or sent to visitors.
Quantcast is the only measurement service to provide audience data for both unique cookies counts and people. The Quantcast inference-based direct measurement model takes into account numerous factors including the frequency of visitation and the respective balance between work and home access to build a translation of cookies to people that is unique to each digital media property.
The model was introduced in June 2008 and is detailed in our white paper, 'Cookie Corrected Audience Data' available to view or download here.

More info here.

As a courtesy, Quantcast provides 'rough' audience estimates for non-Quantified digital media properties. These rough estimates are just that - far from perfect. We strongly recommend non-Quantified publishers refine the accuracy of our reporting on their audience activity by joining the Quantcast Publisher program at absolutely no cost.

Can we get a test.stackoverflow.com?,"
""SandboxOverflow""?
There have been times I'd have wanted to try something about the Stack Overflow site without touching the actual site. I can't remember specific examples, but one would be deleting my own answer when a bounty is issued, or how negative reputation is handled, etc..
The site could be reset every 24 hours, perhaps even users (with over x reputation on Stack Overflow, Server Fault, or Super User) could create (temporary) accounts with specific privileges/reputation.

"
How much does bad tagging impact StackOverflow?,"
One of the only problems with tagging is that new users won't understand the relationship between tags and how they affect the viewing audience for their question.
I often see new users posting questions with a single tag, and often it's not even related to the problem.  
What about implementing some kind of warning to the user before posting a question if they only use one tag?  In the warning you could re-iterate that using broader tags will widen the viewing audience for their question, and give them a ""submit anyway"" button to make it fairly unobtrusive.

Show Total Votes (or Up/Down Votes),"
The total vote count (score) is denormalized, but the individual up/down vote counts are not.
So to display it on every post would incur 2 vote table queries * number of visible questions / answers. Our DB is fast, but the vote table is pretty massive, and not doing a query is always faster than doing it..
It's possibly something we could do on demand (as @hmemcpy notes), but as an ""always displayed"" it is a non-starter.
(Also: downvotes are still quite rare on Stack Overflow, so I'd say about 90% of the time, when you see a score, it is pure upvotes.)

Suggestion for getting better answers,"
I agree with what Jeffrey said, there is value in a quick answer many times and over time the better, more complete answers tend to float to the top. But I would add, if you're looking to learn something from a question, be a smart consumer and don't assume the right answer is at the top or even the accepted answer. This is especially important, because I would imagine a lot of the time you're not looking for an answer to the same exact question, but a similar question/issue, and therefore you need to be able to apply the answers to your own situation and not be fully reliant on the vote system. The voting system is a tool, not the end all.
"
How to evangelize Stack Overflow (Server Fault and Super User)?,"
The best way to ""evangelize"" is to simply use the sites: Ask great questions. Provide great answers. 
You have already been extremely generous in contributing your time, and others will hopefully reciprocate, in a virtuous ""pay it forward"" cycle. Learn from others, while sharing what you've learned with others!
Sharing is of course welcomed -- the more the merrier -- but ultimately, you shouldn't need to satisfy anyone but yourself.
"
How do I change my login provider(s)?,"
Yes, this is documented on the Stack Overflow blog and in the Help Center.
You can add an unlimited number of logins of your choosing from the account page, by either going to meta.stackexchange.com/users/mylogins/current or by clicking ""Edit Profile & Settings"" at the top of your profile → ""My Logins"" at the left → ""add more logins..."".



If this prompts you to log in as a different user, then you probably already used that ""new"" way to log in earlier. In that case see How can one link / merge / combine / associate two accounts / users? (Anonymous / unregistered / cookie, or Google / Facebook / registered).
You can also remove credentials you no longer wish to be tied to your account from this screen.

Cleaning up our rubbish: do we have a responsibility to clean up old questions?,"
To extend on what Jonathan Sampson & Chealion have said, some ideas:

Old questions (or perhaps questions belonging people that haven't been active in months) automatically become community wiki, so that answers can be more easily updated/corrected
Questions that are set to community wiki automatically make the highest voted answer the ""accepted answer"", since that's what the community thinks (point 1. would lead into this nicely)
Need to allow moderators to ""un-accept"" accepted answers (& possibly ""accept"" other answers, although this is less necessary)
Add a new flag for answers, allowing users/moderators to mark items as being out of date and/or wrong (or possibly automatically after a certain amount of time). After a certain threshold (say 5 votes), display a warning at the top of the answer (similar to how the duplicate question warning shows at the top of a question) informing users the content may be out of date. (this is only necessary for answers, since if the whole question is out of date it can simply be closed as no longer relevant).

"

I think this would both clutter up the close-message, and lead to annoyed people wondering why Rob thought their question was not a ""real question"", when everyone else though it wasn't programming related..
This might happen because a user accidently clicked the wrong close message (example) - it gets averaged out and prevents arguments, I'd say..
"
Why is vote time missing in the SE data dump and SEDE?,"
One of Jeff's requirements in releasing the data dump was that specific user voting data would not be available. The site goes to great lengths to keep voting data private, and I support that. Jeff strongly had in mind the AOL data dump debacle (google it if you're not familiar) in which AOL thought they had anonymised a search dataset but enterprising researchers were able to correlate data searched for with other information and actually identify real-world individuals. Like, down to their home address, just from what they typed into the AOL search box.
Stack Overflow obviously has less private information and less potentially invasive results if voting data were to be exposed, but if the online site keeps voting data private then the data dump should respect that privacy too.
If the millisecond-resolution vote timestamp were included in the dump, I believe the up/down voting patterns could strongly correlate with other activity on the site (questions, answers, comments). The more history available in the dump, the stronger the correlation can be. People use Stack Overflow during certain times of the day and not others, and the usage pattern will be distinct for each individual. There might be enough pattern information in there to identify who cast a given vote or votes.
I'm not completely certain that one could get useful information out of timestamp correlation in this way, but I think there's enough of a risk that I suggested truncating the timestamps. If somebody can present a convincing argument that there wouldn't be a way to discover user voting patterns, then the data dump can always be changed for future runs. It's certainly not set in stone.

Harmonizing user ids among the sites?,"

"
"What do ""great comment"" votes do?","
All the votes do is help to visually identify good or insightful comments. You are correct, the color of the vote count does change at (IIRC) around 5 upvotes, and then again around 10. The specific color is tied to the site you're on; for example, the color becomes more orange on Stack Overflow.
Also, when the page initially loads, there will be at most 5 comments below each post. The rest of the comments can be expanded out, but the initial comments are the five highest-scoring.
Other than that, the score serves no purpose. However, I will say that even though I don't get reputation from a comment vote, I personally like to see that someone liked my comment and thought it was good or insightful.

What should we do with our favourite UserVoice requests?,"
I agree with John Smithers -- pick your favorites and copy n' paste them over here.
I apologize, but in all honesty, there are far too many requests for us to ever get through on UserVoice. I've spent marathon sessions of hours trying to go through them all (not just the top 50) and it's just .. impossible.
Also, some of them date from almost a year ago and I am unsure how relevant they still are in our current brave new world of site status.

How should feature requests/bug reports work on Meta?,"
Here are my thoughts

Make sure the item is tagged [bug] or [feature-request].
Moderators will review all questions with those tags periodically
Moderators will apply moderator-only tags to the item to indicate its status

What are some moderator only tags we might need? Ideas:

[status-completed]
[status-norepro]
[status-declined]
[status-accepted]
[status-deferred]

?
The only time to close is when the item is truly done and complete, forever. I suspect we will use the tags more often for that in case there is further discussion necessary of our ""fixes"" which sometimes are not so.. ""fixed"".. or have other related issues, etc.

Syntax highlighting language hints,"
Note that this question is a bit obsolete, because we now infer prettify language type based on the tags.
See more:
Changes to syntax highlighting
This is now implemented. In addition to tag inference, you can manually specify the language as a hint to Google Code Prettify.
The spec is:
<!-- language: lang-or-tag-here -->

    code goes here

<!-- language: lang-or-tag-here -->

    code goes here

You may use either a tag or a prettify language code to specify, though prettify language codes are always guaranteed to work regardless of what language the tag happens to be set to.
Use <!-- language-all: lang-or-tag --> to use the given highlighting for all the following code blocks.
practical examples
For those with little time...
<!-- language: lang-js -->
<!-- language: typescript -->
<!-- language: c# -->

Please note they're all in lower case, even though the language may be uppercase (C#) or mixed case (TypeScript).
Suppress any syntax highlighting (prevents poor, misleading guesses)
<!-- language: lang-none -->

Use language-all and your syntax highlighting choice shall be used for all code blocks that follow:
<!-- language-all: lang-html -->

Due to several lists of available hints existing throughout Meta, the entire list has been consolidated and moved to the following FAQ:

"
"Should Community Moderators be ""elected for life"", or have terms?","
Yeah, It should be 'for life'. I think this because:

You would be effectively kicking out experienced moderators. 
It would also mean that the moderating 'team' is split once a year. Which is also undesirable. 
Moderating is pretty much the same person to person. Someone who is competent will not be too different from someone else who is competent. It's not like you can have different policies for which users can vote. The job is simply to enforce the terms and conditions of the site and some maintenance/tidying up. 
Although Stack Overflow is meant to be community driven I am not sure on the idea on them worrying about community approval. Sometimes, not often though, it may be their job to be unpopular (say, closing a popular but wildly off-topic question). 

Ultimately I see little to gain in moderator elections. If any moderator is bad/abuses their position then I imagine they would be kicked out by the SO Team anyway!. 
I think regular elections for new moderators is fine, but I don't see why existing ones should be up for re-election and maybe booted out. 
Finally you should consider that generally elections are useful in deciding the direction of the community. This is not that. These are people who follow the policy and decisions decided by the SO team and the community. They are civil servants, not politicians. 
"
Possibility to delete our account,"
Perhaps the delete option should send an e-mail to the registered address and only actually delete when the user returns via the link provided (or enters the code provided).
This should minimise accounts being deleted by accident or maliciously.
UPDATE
Another possibility might be to mark the account as deleted but not actually delete it for a couple of days. If it has been deleted maliciously then it might give the owner enough time to visit the site, spot it and cancel the delete.
Ultimately any system would be prone to spoofing - even the current one of e-mailing the team and asking them to delete the account for you.

"What are ""Community Wiki"" posts?","
Why have Community Wiki posts?
One of the goals of the website is to be a continually evolving source of good information. Community Wiki posts help enhance the wiki aspect of the site.
For more information about the proper use of community wiki, see The Future of Community Wiki.
How do Community Wiki posts work?
Community Wiki posts work by partly transferring ownership of the post from the original author to the community.  They make the post easier to edit and maintain by a wider group of users, but they do not contribute to any user's reputation.
Some of the key features are:

A much lower reputation (100 instead of 2000) is needed to freely edit a community wiki post originally made by someone else. 1
Voting on a community wiki post does not affect the author's reputation, and downvoting a community wiki answer will not deduct 1 reputation from the voter.
Accepting an answer marked as community wiki does not affect its original author's reputation, and does not give +2 to the question author.
Bounties awarded to answer marked as community wiki still give reputation to the original author.
Edits suggested by users with less than 100 reputation will still provide +2 reputation to the editor when approved.
The original author still gets badges based on community posts.
The original author keeps the reputation gained (or lost) before their post entered community mode.
The original author still receives notifications for substantial edits, suggested edits, and comments on the post.
The user listed in the author box need not be the original author. Rather, it is the user with the highest percentage of authorship in the final revision, determined by the number of lines inserted or deleted, with a bonus (factor of 2) for the original author. Note that the name shown is calculated upon each edit and cached, so if the user later changes their display name, their previous name will still be displayed until the post is edited again.

How does a post become a Community Wiki post?
There are only three ways that a post becomes community wiki.

The answer's (not question's) author checks the community wiki checkbox when composing or editing the answer. Note that this checkbox isn't available to users with less than 10 reputation. The checkbox also is not available if the question being answered is already a community wiki. 2

If you post an answer to a community wiki question, your answer will also be community wiki.

A moderator has reason to believe that the question or answer serves better in community wiki mode - if you believe your post should be converted to a community wiki, you may flag it for moderator attention.


In the past, questions could be made community wiki by their authors or by certain automatic triggers but now the only means is by a moderator converting it to community wiki. When a moderator converts a question to community wiki, all existing answers will also be converted in addition to converting future answers.3
How can the Community Wiki status be removed from a post?
Community Wiki status can only be removed by a moderator.
If community wiki status is removed from a post, reputation is automatically recalculated as if the post was never a wiki.
How can I find Community Wiki posts?
To search for Community Wiki posts, type wiki:1, wiki:yes, or wiki:true into the search box. See How do I search? for more information.
Miscellaneous

Rollbacks cannot remove community wiki status.

The Community User4 might appear as the last editor of a post, even a non-wiki post. This happens either 1. when an edit by an anonymous user is approved, or 2. when it randomly pokes old unanswered questions so they get some attention. In the latter case, this will only be shown in certain overviews and on a notice on the question, and not an actual revision in the revision history.

If you are looking for an example community wiki post, see this question and this answer. They are all community wikis. You can easily identify community wikis by the text ""community wiki"" where the author's profile picture should be.



1 The original author of a community wiki post can always edit it, even if they have <100 reputation. Other edits made by users with less than 100 reputation must be reviewed in the usual way before being applied.
2 Since October 2010, there is no community wiki checkbox when asking a question.
3 In the past, converting a question to community wiki would not automatically convert the answers, so you may see non-Community Wiki answers to older Community Wiki questions. Additionally, if a non-Community Wiki question is merged into a Community Wiki question, the imported answers will not be automatically converted. If you would like to edit them, you can flag for a moderator to add Community Wiki status to the answer. (Newer answers to these older questions will automatically be Community Wiki.)

"
Can we enable syntax highlighting for code in comments?,"
At least, I would want bold and italic to work.
As for syntax highlighting, you don't get that for simple inlined code sections, so why would you need it in comments.
"
To give each edit own version history,"
I think that this behavior is a byproduct of counting all edits in a five-minute window as one edit. This feature was created because there was a common pattern of quickly answering a question with two or three sentenced and maybe a link. Then the user would immediately edit their answer with more detail, and also correct typos and other errors.
The problem comes when you factor in the fact that a post rolls over to Community Wiki after 5(?) edits from the original author. Since it's very easy to make these 5 edits in the initial period of 'forming' the post, people wanted a way to retain ownership and reputation from these posts. The solution has been collapsing all edits within a 5-minute window into 1 edit.
If it's possible to retain the multiple-edits-count-as-one feature and still have a revision entry for each edit, then I support this feature request.
"
"Do you clean up (delete) your old, unvoted answers? Is doing so encouraged?","
Yes - I do this. It's one of the reasons I've asked for the ability to see separate up and down votes so I can see those answers that truly have no votes. If an answer has equal numbers of up and down votes (usually 1!) I'd like the chance to be able to correct the answer.
I also only delete where my answer is just one of several that say the same thing. If there are no (or only one or two) other answers then I will leave it.

Canclling upvot on commnt? - Mta Stack Exchang,"
I just added this, but there are some ground rules: 

You can un-upvote a comment within the first 60 seconds, provided you did not navigate away. 
Once you un-upvote a comment you can not upvote it again. 

We do not want flip flopping, nor do we want people to un-upvote stuff from the past. The only use case is undoing a mis-click. 
Here's what it looks like when you start to unupvote a comment:

Then if you try to upvote the same comment again:

"
Allow questions to be saved as drafts prior to posting,"
This is now complete for answers and new questions.
If you start asking a question, but do not successfully submit, you will see your last saved question draft the next time you visit the ask a question page.
If you start answering a particular question, but do not successfully submit, you will see your last saved answer draft the next time you visit that particular question page.

We save drafts automatically for all new answers and new questions once every 45 seconds.
Drafts are not supported on self-answers.
Drafts are not supported on edits.
You only get one draft for an answer and one for a question. (If you start a new post, the old draft is cleared.)
Each site has its own draft storage, e.g. you can have multiple draft questions saved on multiple Stack Exchange sites
Drafts will be automatically cleared after a week.
Drafts work for anonymous users as well.

Also:

Pending answer draft is cleared on successful submission of any answer.
Pending question draft is cleared on successful submission of any question.

Last but not least, technical details about the draft mechanism can be found here:

Drafts are stored in redis for 7 days.
For anonymous we use cookie to track the user.
For non anonymous we use the user id.
We ship it to the server in the heartbeat (once a minute or so), the heartbeat also notifies you when new answers were added in the banner on the top.

"Filter ""My Tags"" questions using ""Interesting Tags""","
Actually if we could add the Interesting Tags filter to each major section (front page, Questions, and Unanswered) that would be cool.
"
Display the original question beneath the answer edit form,"
This bugs me too!
Alternatively, clicking ""edit"" could load the edit form right there on the page.  This would help in some cases where you want to copy/paste something from a comment or from another answer.
"
Add markdown support for hidden-until-you-click text (aka spoilers),"
This has been implemented.
The syntax is 
>! Spoiler text
Example:

 Moon languages rock!

 From http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/moon_language
Noun
moon language (plural moon languages)
 1. (slang) Text written in an incomprehensible script, especially Japanese or Chinese.
(Multi-line spoilers need Markdown double-spaces to get a newline. Automatic lists, headings, et cetera are not supported.)

This is not yet reflected in the preview pane.
Essentially, a blockquote where each line begins with a ! will be a spoiler.
Spoilers have the same text color as background color, but can be revealed by hovering over them (or selecting the text).
"
"Distinguish between ""unanswered"" and ""unsolved""","
I agree there is a semantic difference, and there is a corresponding display difference (0 answers and red box vs N answers and green box). However, from a use case perspective, I believe grouping them together under the same tag is preferable. If the user wants to personally be more selective, the visual indicators are there to allow for that.

"
How about doing away with rep on Meta Stack Overflow?,"
I believe the issue with doing this is there are still tasks that need to be done, like closing questions, retagging, editting, etc. And these require the reputation system to determine who can perform the tasks. Additionally, everything that is valid here would be at best Community-Wiki on SO, so perhaps its the Community-Wiki that doesn't belong?
"
Improper pagination of user search,"
Hmm, results come from:
    http://www.stackoverflow.com/users/filter/jo
But the links point to:
    http://www.stackoverflow.com/users?page=num
Doesn't appear to be a &userFilter, &userfilter, or &filter variable for the GET method. Nor a page segement to the user-friendly method.
"
"Put ""edit"" and/or ""retag"" links on the question list pages","
I think this could be problematic. 
In order to correctly re-tag a question, one needs to have a full understanding of exactly what's being asked and all of the context. For longer questions that don't fit 100% into the small letterbox visible on the main questions page, this could lead to a spate of bad (though well-intentioned) re-tagging.
I don't think it's too much to ask a user to click through to the full question in all it's glory, with all of the clarifying comments and gory detail, before allowing them to give it an edit. 
"
"Mark tag as ""interesting"" or ""ignored"" from that tag's page","
On most pages, we now enable a hover menu on every tag:

This supports adding and removing from the interesting/ignored tag list. Click the star to toggle between:

no state (gray star)
ignored (red X)

Credits to Alconja for suggesting this method!
"
"Lower the rep required to edit community wiki posts (or stop calling them ""wiki"")","
I would support both, actually.
A rep limit of 100 might be a little too low, but 250 would work nicely, I think. And changing the name from community wiki to simply community would be a good idea (especially since community posts are, by definition, not owned by an individual but by the entire community).
"
"Allow non openID logons, or have SO become an openID provider","

LINQ tags in Stack Ovrflow - Mta Stack Exchang,"
This goes hand in hand with the many suggestions to have some kind of tag editing tool. The biggest problem right now is that it is a lot of power to be giving users and they could do some pretty dangerous stuff to the database with it. Consistency is something we should definitely strive for when it comes to tags, however, so at the very least we could make topics like this and have them manually do it.

How to embed Stack Overflow flair in a WordPress.com (free) blog?,"

"
Stop tag completion from stealing cursor focus,"
I made a similar suggestion a while back on uservoice, but it was declined at the time.  I'll reproduce it here since it is similar to (but not exactly the same as) your suggestion.

Tag suggestions tooltip steals focus when dismissed


Start creating a new question.
In the ""Tags"" box, type ""java"".
  => The suggestions tooltip appears, showing ""java"", ""javascript"", etc.
Click in the main edit area (where you would actually type the question).

Expected: Focus goes to the question area so I can type my question.
Actual: Focus goes to the question area very briefly, then the the tag suggestions tooltip disappears, and when it disappears it gives focus to the tags edit box.

"
"Can I get 50 questions on my front page, please?","
Yes, and also get rid of the annoying lag between the moment a page finishes to load and when the filtered-out message are removed.

"
Search with number (like '401') will take you to a question,"
Not sure if it's a bug or if it's by design.

"
Tag Highlighting - Mta Stack Exchang,"
For the first point: I think they're not highlighted because you're looking at an interesting tag, so naturally all of them would be highlighted - and that doesn't add any value.  I'm not sure that highlighting ones that contain any other interesting tags would help - you already know they're interesting... is a question about mysql + php more interesting than a question about php?  I don't think so when you've chosen to look at the php tag.
As for your second point - could not reproduce.  I just got taken back to Questions

"
"Bug: ""yesterday"" tab in responses page shows both yesterday and today","
I will port here my comment on the UV entry:  
True: ""yesterday"" should be the link allowing me to see what I have done yesterday compared to today.  
Instead, I have to:

remember the ""today"" score, 
go to yesterday 
and *mentally subtract"" it from the ""yesterday score"". 

Very painful ;)
"
When is a user no longer considered a new user?,"
This is set out here, with summary:

If you’re a new user, with reputation below 100

You may only post 1 question every 20 minutes
You may only post 1 answer every 3 minutes


and then Jeff added (in the comments):

if your rep is > 100 you are totally immune to this rate limiter.

The 20 minutes surprises me, unless they've had to revise the numbers. But it won't be long before you have 100+ points. And register your account too; that may help (and it'll avoid you losing it when your browser dumps the cookies).
"

"
Searching Questions with n-Pages of Answers,"
I do like your mockup, but I just don't know how big a priority it is -- that many answers is such a rare occurrence on the sites.
edit: we now support the inquestion:1234 operator which does allow you to do this via the search box, at least.. 
edit: I also implemented an inquestion:this -- it works on the referrer so it'll only work for the first search from the current page, but hopefully that's enough.

"
Linking to an answer in an answer for a dupe,"
Vote to close the question, and leave it at that. You might also want to add a comment, but I wouldn't worry too much about it - if it's genuinely an exact or very close duplicate, I suspect it won't last very long anyway (unless new answers are posted before it's closed which have genuine merit). Move on to another question where your time can be better spent :)
"

I don't understand this. I just added a tag to a question like so:

{type enough chars to match the tag I want}  
enter [completes tag]

Enter does exactly what you describe, or maybe I'm not understanding what you wrote.

Randomly reorder all answers posted within ten minutes of each other,"
This is a terrible way of trying to correct the FGITW ""Problem"" (which isn't a problem). We should be rewarding those who post quality answers quickly. If I get first in the drive-thru, I don't want to be shuffled around with 5 other customers just to make things ""fake-fair"".

If you hover the tool tip does show the year.
Currently in the non-tool tip display it displays:

What are the guidelines for community wiki on Meta Stack Overflow?,"
When you want to have a question that has a collection of information from the entire community. For example a community edited list of some sorts. (just like CW's were supposed to be)
Community Wikis have been misunderstood for a long time now. Here's a post that's a prime example of what a CW post should be.

So any post that could possibly contain information that the community decides on and edits. Think of it as a wiki article (sorta)
"
Flag abusiv usrs - Mta Stack Exchang,"
If you flag a post from that user for moderator attention, it is highly likely that we will look at their other recent activities, including (but not limited to) questions, answers, comments, votes - and correlations to other users if there is a suspicion of a sock-puppet.
If they are being a nuisance, there are a range of options - but also don't forget that just because they've annoyed you doesn't guarantee that we're going to throw the book at them.
The e-mail approach works too, but don't forget the team is US-based, but between us the moderators have pretty-much the whole day covered; if they are actively an issue, a moderator flag may get acted on quicker than the e-mail. Or do both.
Also; don't forget you can flag... if somebody is being offensive, flag them as offensive. For most puppet accounts, the penalty (100 points) may be enough to take away much of their access.
"
Please charge rep for questions after threshold,"
We have thresholds for every type of voting in the system, and we have a threshold for how much rep one can attain (which is a quasi-threshold on how many answers a typical person will post in a day), so I don't necessarily have a problem with this. 
If you have a problem, it is likely that problem will still be around tomorrow which you can ask. If it is an important problem, you shouldn't be afraid of losing a little rep to get it answered in a hurry.

Etiquette for closing your own questions

Specially this quote (by Euro Micelli)

The way I look at it, these questions and answers are not just for you but for anybody who might have the same question in the future. Just because an answer works for you now, it doesn't mean necessarily it will work for someone else in the future.

"
Footer does not stick to bottom of page,"
We looked at this, but the so-called ""fix"" is really nasty and involves a lot of kludgy, hacky layout. And lots of lines of it.
Kind of a case where the cure is worse than the disease.
"
Is there a better way to let users know to post questions as questions and answers as answers?,"
StackOverflow is a Q&A site. And it's designed around that.
I think it's working fine as is, you are going to have edge cases like this, but it's not something you need to change the design over.
"
Why can't we filter unanswered questions by tags?,"
You are on the wrong tab. Switch away from the My Tags tab, because it will override your selection (My Tags is effectively a list of tags, so it cannot be filtered.)
Remember, SO tabs are all STICKY. If you select a particular tab one, it will stay selected.
the My Tags tab on /unanswered now overrides and shows exactly what tags are in play, also, it uses your ""interesting"" tags if you've populated them.
"
Is a bounty still auto-awarded if you downvote the answer?,"
The highest upvoted answer gets half of the bounty. If you accept an answer, it gets full bounty. If no answers have more than two upvotes, no bounty will be awarded.
Bounty FAQ item.
Also this snippet from the Blog.

You do not accept an answer. Any answer that was a) provided after the bounty period started and b) has 2 or more upvotes is automatically accepted after 7 days. The bounty is subtracted from your reputation. The answerer is awarded half the bounty amount (unless it’s your own answer, see #3 below).

But if you downvote an answer that has many upvotes, and in the end that answer is at the top (with two or more upvotes, and you didn't accept another one) that answer will get the bounty.
"
How oftn do CAPTCHAs appar? - Mta Stack Exchang,"
To trigger CAPTCHA while editing, asking, or answering:

The minimum window is 5 seconds
The maximum window is 40 minutes

There is a maximum of:

one edit every 30 seconds
one answer every 60 seconds
one question every 60 seconds

To trigger CAPTCHA while doing performing other actions, there are throttles of various sizes depending on the action -- it's mostly a ""slow down"" speed bump to inhibit potentially dangerous ""I'm going to post obscene things as fast as possible!"" situations.
Some new reductions in CAPTCHA throttle thresholds, if you have > 10k rep:

for edits -- reduced by two-thirds
for post submission times -- min seconds reduced by one half, max minutes increased by x2

Assuming you are a logged in user and have >= 200 reputation: after successfully completing one captcha, we now suppress captcha for 5 minutes on your account.
The maximum window for submitting a post or edit has been removed.
"
Please inverse the community user's duplicate listing,"
Yes!
One useful side-effect of this would be to stop people (accidently) voting-to-close the wrong part of the duplicate, something I've done a few times (I voted to close a duplicate, not realising that the other was already closed)

I have seen many useful information in ""duplicate"" posts. hayalci

Currently, if there is useful answers in the duplicate they basically disappear. They are really hard to find, even if you search:


I've seen thematically identical questions asked with ZERO words in common. Last time I checked, Lucene wasn't magical faerie dust, unfortunately.. :) [source]


With proposed inverse-dupe links, you have a list of other very similar questions, which you can check for other useful answers if you're really interested in the question.
Perhaps the inverse-duplicates could be accessed by a link next to the edit/retag/flag/close, just below the tags? Something like..

Not sure about the wording, it's a bit long, but it seems to me a sensible place to put it..
Another two mockups, based on Shog9 and Ólafur's comments,
Image Dead - Duplicated by sidebar modification
Or, a slight variant on the current ""Related questions"" side bar, which lists (and highlights) exact duplicates:
Image dead: Related Questions sidebar with dupes highlighted
I quite like the last one - it's not as big of a change, doesn't much extra clutter (no new tabs/links under question), and is a sensible place - duplicates are ""related questions"" after all.

This is another request for enhancing the search feature, to wit:

Also note that the alias

Furthermore the tags listed on the user page now automatically generate this syntax; so when you click on a tag from a user's page you will get just the questions or answers that user has provided within that tag.

Automatic tag suggstions - Mta Stack Exchang,"

Perhaps next to the tag box there could be a ""Help!"" button - it would display a little box with a short description about tagging, and some suggested tags..
The suggested tags would be generated by getting all the most used tags from the ""related questions"" (the ones displayed below the Title: input)

(From my answer here)
del.icio.us has a similar feature:

""Recommended"" are tags I've used before, that other people have also used for the URL, ""Popular"" are ones I may have not used, but are the most common for the URL.
The ""tags I've used before"" may be irrelevant for StackOverflow, but it's a good demonstration of how I think the tags could be presented (not auto-filling the Tags input, but suggesting them in a separate box, and adding the tag when you click it)
"
Why are badges sometimes not awarded?,"
You probably lost an Enlighted badge somewhere along the way. Typical reasons:

Question was deleted;
Answer was voted to less than 10 upvotes because of a downvote, someone changing an upvote or a rep recalc losing some people's votes; or
OP changed accepted answer.

In those cases you don't lose your existing Enlighted badges. You simply won't be awarded another one until you have enough accepted answers that qualify. 
"
Show possible duplicates in the main post before it's closed,"
These are inserted as comments now, as each close vote is cast.
"
Allow same user to add multiple links as possible duplicates,"
I disagree.  The point of exact duplicate is that there is one primary question to which all others should refer.  This excludes questions which may be useful, but are not EXACT duplicates - those can be posted in an answer or comment to the question.
If you find multiple EXACT duplicates please determine which one should be the parent and mark the newer question as an exact duplicate of the parent.  The parent is usually the oldest question, but sometimes a newer question with more information or which is phrased better might be a better choice.
Then vote to close all other exact duplicates with the same parent.  Consider posting a message here on meta so that other moderators can consider your request and close questions which might not otherwise receive enough votes for close as they've fallen off the front page.
But PLEASE do NOT promulgate multiple ""exact"" duplicates.  The point of duplicate identification and closing is to shunt all the best information for a given problem into one spot.
"
What to do if you are interested in a (good) question that didn't get a good answer?,"
Why not research and add an answer to the question yourself? This will bump it to the front page and engender discussion. You can also edit your answer over time to improve it, which will also bump the question. (Note that trivial editing for the sake of bumping alone is considered abuse and seriously frowned upon. Not that you'd do this, but just putting the disclaimer in..)
If you feel the question failed because it was asked in a flawed way, edit it to improve the question. This will also bump the question and maybe result in new answers and interest.
If you don't have the 2k rep to edit someone else's question and you feel the question was flawed, suggest an edit to that question.
"
Should we reduce rep bonus for upvotes on posts with a negative score?,"
It would be slightly more complex to engineer, but I've often thought I'd like to see rep bonuses and penalties as a bell curve, i.e. diminishing at extremes.
My thinking here is that it's not particularly fair that an simple answer on a high visibility subject can easily gain 20+ upvotes and be no more ""correct"" than a detailed, insightful, genius answer on something obscure which might get just 1 or 2 upvotes.
If it was my design, I'd allow a certain potential maximum rep change (plus or minus) for any question and weight the score around zero the heaviest so +10 might represent 90% of the potential value and +20 represents 100%. Attaching rep to the score of the question rather than the individual votes would also mean the overall view was important, and up and downvotes were commutative: +5 and -5 would give you 0 rep rather than 40 as it does now.
"
Include meta in search results and related questions?,"
Naw, let's not do that.
If we show meta search results in with SO search results, folks will just stay on SO for their meta-SO tasks, including asking more meta-SO questions on SO proper. Which kinda defeats the whole purpose of having a meta-SO.
Close 'em, with prejudice, and send 'em this way - then they can stay, if that's what they really want...

"
Choose the same question as others suggested when closing question as dup,"
Proposition 3:
Make clicking on the link show the question in the pop-up (rather than in a separate tab). The pop-up dialog expands vertically to include the question. It can be reasonably small, with scroll bars if necessary. 
At the bottom of the question text, include a link saying ""Yes, this is the one I mean"" - so at least a user has to scroll through the whole question (if it's long enough to require scroll bars) before they can do it, but they don't have to go through different tabs and have the other tab communicate back to the original one - keep it in the same flow.

Ability to add tag to Interesting/Ignored by clicking on it,"
It could be just a small '+' and/or '-' sign next to each tag (depending on it already being in your favorite or ignore tags), which only become visible when you hover over the tag (like with voting or flagging comments), then it isn't intrusive and very easy to use.
"
Should reputation from SO carry over to Meta?,"
I don't buy into the whole ""trusted by SO and not by META"" line of thinking. 
Which skills exactly are lacking in a SO user with 10K rep to justify not letting him edit on Meta? Privileges that come with rep are just a way of making sure you have enough experience and familiarity with the system before you interfere with it. 
So I honestly don't see the danger in letting high rep users from SO carry over their privileges to Meta. Can someone give an example of a reasonable scenario that demonstrates why a user might be trusted on SO but not trusted on Meta?
"

Agreed. Between the inconsistencies in the rep limit being calculated over a daily basis (thanks to the differences in local vs. server time), and the inconsistencies that other users such as Cletus have pointed out previously, I think it is losing its popularity (if it ever really had any). It is a serious demotivator for very active users who contribute a lot to the site.
I know I and others have hit our rep limit early in the day and then completely stopped activity for the day, which cuts down the number of people who are willing to answer a question.
As I mentioned in another comment, I am also a strong advocate of raising the rep limit to something more reasonable for super-active users, such as 500 rep in a day -- if you aren't going to bother getting rid of it.

"How to ""bump"" a question that's the same as the one you wanted to ask","
Edit the question and make it better - even if you just go through and fix a few typos, improve formatting a little, or make the title more descriptive.
I don't like the idea of doing a ""null edit"" where nothing really changes, or editing a tag for the sake of editing a tag.
A better question is more likely to be answered, so spending a bit of time improving it (less than if you had to write the question from scratch) is to every-ones benefit!

How to ask a smart qustion - Mta Stack Exchang,"
I generally dislike people who link ""How to ask questions the smart way"" on Q&A sites and on IRC.
One, it is off-putting to a new user who, upon reading the basic FAQs, finds a 20-page manual on how to ask questions the ""proper"" way.
Secondly, the main problem with HTAQTSW is it caters and is useful to no one.  Why is this?  Because the people who could use it most will never read it.  The people who ask poorly phrased, un-researched questions just aren't going to take the time to read a treatise on how to ask questions.
The people who do take the time to read it and understand it generally already ask questions of a higher caliber than most of the masses.
A while back Joel talked about ""How to ask questions the smart way"" on the podcast and I actually agreed with him on this point.

Please add a way to 'bump' questions back to the front page,"
Here's a different idea: Allow for bumping by users, but they come with a cost of reputation to perform the action. I imagine this cost could be anywhere from 1-5 reputation points. This would ensure that bumping is done more for actually getting an answer than it is for potentially cheap rep-whoring.

FYI for folks reading this years later who don't understand why it's status-completed: when this feature was requested (and this answer posted answered) bounties were limited to question authors; this was changed thereby fulfilling the request.

Are power users creating a vacuum on SO?,"
Second problem...
Do I make it hard for other users to feel they're contributing?
I can see that my frequent answers could be somewhat intimidating to some people. (If only they knew me in real life, I suspect that would make all the difference. I'm about the least intimidating person in the world.) There are competing demands here:

I want the best answer possible to be available
I want the questioner to get a good, accurate answer quickly
I want other people to contribute too (and improve their own skills in doing so)

Obviously this smacks of arrogance - but I really don't contribute an answer if I don't think it would add anything to what's already posted.
Possible personal solutions that I (and others) could apply:

Stop posting entirely
Don't answer a question until it's 5 minutes old
Don't answer a question which already has a ""reasonably good"" answer (maybe just add comments suggesting improvements)
Don't answer ""easy"" questions

I'm open to all of these things. I love answering questions, but I'd hate for that to become a ""net negative"" for the community.
I hope the situation isn't actually so bad, and that really people like the idea of competing with me (and others like Marc).
One thing to note: it's pure coincidence and somewhat unfortunate that the two topics I know most about (C# and Java) are probably the biggest topics on Stack Overflow. I suspect if my languages of choice were Perl and Haskell, no-one would have heard of me.

Why are SO and MSO at different SVN Revisions?,"
In the Meta announcement blog entry, Jeff noted that there'd be code-level differences:


bounties make little sense on a discussion site
wording needs to be tweaked (i.e. questions->topics, answers->replies)
need to be able to follow questions/get notices of additional
replies
remove notion of community wiki, as discussion sites have a stronger sense
of ownership, plus nothing will be
off-topic


Those would require code changes rather than just database changes, since there aren't database switches you can throw (yet) to change the wording on the site or disable wiki across the board.

That's not really how Wikipedia works. Each language version of Wikipedia is it's own ""encyclopedia.""

Royalties from a Stack Overflow-sourced book,"
Check out this FAQ item from the CC site.
Here's a snippet, please read the entire thing.

Can I still make money from a work I make available under a Creative Commons licenses?
Absolutely. Firstly, because our licenses are non-exclusive which means you are not tied down to only make a piece of your content available under a Creative Commons license; you can also enter into other revenue-generating licenses in relation to your work. One of our central goals is to encourage people to experiment with new ways to promote and market their work.
Secondly, the noncommercial license option is an inventive tool designed to allow people to maximize the distribution of their works while keeping control of the commercial aspects of their copyright.

So as long as the license is not under a ""non commercial"" license option. Which I believe the SO license is under.

Notifications for concurrent changes when editing posts,"
This is partially implemented. You'll get async notifications during editing, if someone else saves a revision during your editing. These notifications ping the server every 45 seconds to check.
Additionally, we now prevent edit collisions on save.
When you click ""Save Edits"", if the post changed while you were editing, we now return:

Warning! You're editing an old revision. If you save it, you will effectively roll back to this old version of the post.

And:

Oops! Your edit couldn't be submitted because:

{username} edited {tags / body / title} of this post; try refreshing this post and editing again.


It is specific to the area in question, so one user can edit body and you can edit tags without conflicting. (Or title, etc). It's only when you both edit the same field at the same time this error is returned on save.

"

"
Will any badges ever be re-colored?,"
I think the problem here is a misconception on what badges are for. I may be wrong but I believe badges are there to encourage good behaviour, rather than to be evenly awarded. It doesn't matter that a Silver one gets awarded more than a Bronze one, it matters that the appropriate behaviour is appropriately rewarded. The Gold, Silver, and Bronze levels indicate the level of desire for users to behave a certain way.
"
Why do I have to wait before nominating a question for deletion?,"
I understand your frustration, but as Kyle and Tom note, the waiting period allows closing to be disputed and thus helps to prevent abuse. In situations where a post must be deleted faster, flag it: offensive and spam deletions are both automated and require no waiting period, while asking for moderator intervention can expedite the removal of inappropriate questions that don't fit into either of those categories.
"
Will the badges ever have a design to them instead of just having colors?,"
Give each badge its own achievement icon?  I think it's a cool idea, but it's a lot of work.  I suspect that if Jeff was open to this, they'd solicit icons from the community (and not on a paid basis).  So if you really want this, I'd mock up a couple of icons and see if they like the look of it.

We need meta tags to be able to organize and search tags easily,"
I think what he wants is for a tagged named [@.net], to be associated with [.net], [c#], [f#] etc. That way if someone wants to follow everything having to do with .Net, all they would have to do is follow [@.net]. Whenever there is a new tag associated with that meta-tag, they wouldn't have to add that tag into their interesting tags list.
There could also be a tag-page https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/@.net, that shows a list of all it's associated tags.
So then going to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/@.net, would essentially be the same as going to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/.net+or+c%23+or+f%23, but with the added benefit of including new tags as they appear.

Or perhaps make Newest Questions a higher-rep privilege?
"
Bolding with ** isn't working properly,"
This is not a bug; this is by design.
It becomes very difficult to talk about code when your_variable_names_are_suddenly_underlined. Intra-word emphasis is a bad idea and we have EXPLICITLY disabled it.
See: https://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/06/three-markdown-gotcha/.

1) Markdown’s single biggest flaw is its intra-word emphasis.
I don’t think anybody writes:
un*fricking*believable
often enough to justify making it nearly impossible to talk about tokens with underscores in them:
some_file_name
is interpreted as:
some<em>file</em>name
It even works across word boundaries:
file_one and file_two
becomes:
file<em>one and file</em> two
Whenever you’re writing tokens with underscores you have to make absolutely sure you’re in a backtick-delimited code span. The same problem will also nail you on equations like abc, but that seems to pop up less frequently.
Showdown follows the reference implementation on all this, but in WMD I do a little preprocessing to hack the idiocy away: basically I just backslash-escape any underscores or asterisks that might trigger it. It’s a flagrant violation of the standard, but since it’s a pre-pass that should produce identical output with any Markdown processor, I feel justified. Unfortunately my hack did screw up one edge case (which I don’t have in front of me) and there isn’t any way to disable it. Both those things will change in the next release.

Searching for a tag containing * breaks the site,"
We now replace the client wildcard (*) with the server wildcard (~) on tags.
Update: Due to changes in ASP.Net 4.0 URLs like this are now properly handled:

However, be careful, because the server has rules that the client does not. Most notably, any wildcard searches MUST be a minimum of 3 characters in length (not including the wildcard chars themselves), or they are ignored.

Shouldn't a reputation points-less newbie at least be able to upvote a good answer to his/her own questions?,"
As a rep-less newbie, you've not yet earned the site's trust. Fortunately, it's not hard: ask a good question or post a good answer, and you'll quickly have that ability - all it takes is two up-votes!
As the author of a question, the site does grant you one special ability: you can mark an answer as ""accepted"", proclaiming to the world that it helped you solve your problem. IMHO, this is actually quite a bit more helpful than merely being able to up-vote: once a question has an Accepted answer, passing readers are able to read that answer knowing that it actually worked, and thereby better understand your problem. Not to mention the little bit of satisfaction it can give to the kind author of that answer...
So be patient, new user! You'll be able to up-vote soon enough. Until then, exercise the abilities that you do have to their full extent!

Please allow wildcards in tag searches,"
Looks like it might be possible
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_Server_Full_Text_Search#Prefix_Term_Searches
Actually, it's not possible, since that's only a ""begins with"" search which does not work well with our tag data. On top of that, asterisks aren't possible in URLs (this was fixed in ASP.Net 4.0).
However, I implemented an experimental ""explode"" operator which allows you to effectively do the same thing -- it ""explodes"" the tags using ~ wildcards in a begins-with and/or ends-with manner.
For example:
all questions tagged bug, but without a tag beginning with ""status-""
https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/bug%20-status-~
all questions with a tag containing ""edit""
https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/~edit~
I haven't fully tested all the permutations, but you must include at least 4 characters for it to be a valid match.
Also: THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL. Like I said!

Update: You can now use * for tag wildcards as well, for example:
https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/bug%20-status-*
https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/edit

How do you earn the Enthusiast badge?,"
I can't find it now, but there's another question similar to this with an answer along the lines of ""you must perform an undisclosed amount of activity"" each day to get credit for a visit that day. The reasoning is that they don't want to award the badge to someone just for pointing a bot at SO -- the idea is that you, presumably a human, have visited and at least clicked around to a couple of questions and maybe voted every day.
See the answer to this question.
And: List of all badges with full descriptions (my emphasis below)

Enthusiast

silver; awarded once; same family as Fanatic (gold)
Visit the site for 30 days in a row
  
  
This can be tracked in the user profile under ""consecutive days""
Simply loading the site is not enough to count as a ""visit""

The exact amount of activity required to count as a visit is not public information

Each ""day"" lasts from midnight UTC to immediately before midnight, UTC; days are not counted in local time

Sometimes called ""the woot! badge"" because it was sponsored by woot.com early in SO's history. The badge name was displayed using their logo during that time.

It's a form of information pornography; but yes, it is useful for all manner of number crunching and following users and their trek through the system. That's what I like about the idea -- that you could then have time-based metrics to solve all sorts of issues:

What percentage of 'new' users ask Subjective questions?
How does the nature of questions change as a user gets higher in rank?

Right now you could determine that through a lot of time-based analysis, but it would be complex. It would be nice to have this information de-normalized, even if just a tooltip when hovering over the question asker's name.

"
How long does it take for badges to be awarded? How are they generated?,"
""Informed"" badge
This badge is awarded immediately after you open the site's tour page while logged in and scroll to the section about badges.
""Beta"" badge
This badge isn't awarded to users who meet its criteria until after a site finishes its private beta. This is because the criteria for this badge used to be undisclosed and this was to prevent people from figuring the criteria out.
Regular badges (except ""Informed"" and ""Beta"")
These badges are awarded by a scheduled job. Every few minutes, there's a percentage chance for a certain specific badge's query to run and award all users who qualify for it. The percentage chance is unique per badge and depends on how expensive the badge's query is to run. Under some rare cases, due to random chance, it may be possible that a certain badge's query may not run for many hours, but the majority of the time, the badge query runs at least once every hour, and in 99.9% of cases, it runs at least once every 24 hours.
Badges that check for number of days (e.g. Refiner, Inquisitive, Epic, etc.) are usually awarded once per day, to ensure that users don't earn the badges if they meet the criteria early in the day but cease to meet them by the time the day is over.
General rule: Wait at least 24 hours. If you haven't gotten it by then, you probably didn't meet the criteria for the badge, or you initially met them but ceased to meet them by the time the job ran. Try checking the list of all badges and their exact criteria. If you still didn't get awarded a badge after 24 hours and you've confirmed that you still continue to meet its criteria, go ahead and file a report, as at that point, chances are that the badge query is at fault, but it may also be that the badge query simply didn't run due to unlucky random chance (see above).
Tag badges
The tag-based badges are calculated on a daily basis at 03:00 UTC, which is when all the tag scores get updated. At that time, any new badges you may have earned will also be awarded, and any badges for which you no longer meet the criteria will be revoked.
Again, if you do not receive the badge at that time, you probably don't meet the criteria, or ceased to meet them by the time the script ran. Hover over your score to make sure that your stats for the tag match the requirements. Also keep in mind that a tag must have at least 100 questions using it before it even qualifies for tag badges.
"
Should edits be always attributed?,"
I think it is important to be very clear and obvious that another user has edited it - they may have done harm.
In the case of a bad edit:

If it is obvious that it is edited by another user, it is likely to result in an edit rollback.
If it isn't obvious, it is likely to result in down-vote / closure / flags / deletion etc.

Besides - I want to know you made the good edit, so I can reward it ;-p
"
"Please add trophies that get awarded to the user who has performed ""best"" based on a given set of conditions over a period of time","
I think we need to be careful with badges. While they are useful to encourage good behaviour, if you're not careful winning the badge becomes more important than the behaviour.
As an example take the Civic Duty and Strunk & White badges. When I started here (OK on SO) I knew those badges existed but achieving them seemed a distant goal. As time progressed and I started voting (& editing when I had enough rep) they started getting nearer.
As I approached the 300 votes I started hitting my vote cap as I was actively looking for posts to vote on. I only voted for posts I would have voted for in normal circumstances but I actively sought them out rather than just stumbling across them in the normal course of events. Once I achieved the badge my voting fell back to its previous behaviour. A graph would show this peak. The same applies to my edits, start of sporadic, hit a peak just before the badge and then drop down again.
Now you might say that I should be voting/editing at the higher level all the time - but I should be doing other things other than hanging out on SO/MSO & that amount of voting/editing takes time.
So what I'm trying to say is that too many badges might distort people's usage of the site to the detriment of the site. So while we should consider new rewards we should consider all the possible outcomes.

Ultimately we can't force people to use their votes in particular ways, although there is guidance already I believe.

Can't log in with my OpenID - Troubleshooting Tips,"
Based on our experience, these steps can help troubleshooting OpenID login issues.

Are you behind a proxy or firewall? OpenID requires very long URLs and proxies / firewalls with aggressive settings will sometimes block OpenID accidentally. This has been documented a bunch of times, often in corporate settings. If so, try without the proxy/firewall -- or convince your network admins that OpenID is in fact safe to allow..

Have you modified the default cookie policy in your browser? OpenID, and our login process, requires cookies to be enabled and match the default settings that browsers ship with. If you have modified the cookie policy in your browser (or even worse, have disabled cookies altogether) this can prevent logins from working.

Have you tried clearing your domain cookies? Sometimes the cookie information gets corrupted somehow (not quite sure what happens here) but clearing cookies for the domain in question (serverfault.com, superuser.com, stackoverflow.com) has been known to work.

Have you tried in a different browser? The world is lousy with great browsers, and switching out browsers can quickly tell you if there's something ""wonky"" with your browser plugins, configuration, etc.

Are you able to log in to other sites that support OpenID? Lots of sites now support OpenID including big ones like Facebook. Does your OpenID work there?

Does your OpenID profile have invalid information in it? This is quite rare, but we have seen instances where profiles with problematic info (like invalid / gibberish email addresses) cause exceptions on our end. If possible, try a new, default OpenID or switch OpenID providers just for testing.

Is your site especially slow to respond? In order to prevent denial of service attacks, it's common for OpenID libraries to have cutoff times of a few seconds when making HTTP requests. If you're delegating, try putting your delegation on a blank, plain vanilla HTML ""hello world"" page to remove any processing delays.

Do you use a self-signed SSL certificate? Because self-signed SSL certificates, if generally accepted, would allow DNS poisoning or other network attacks to enable identity spoofing, we do not support them.

Is your HTML valid? If you are OpenID delegation, something as simple as a missing opening <head> tag will cause an OpenID login failure but you won't necessarily know it from viewing your site in a modern browser. Check your HTML for validity.


Check your OpenID
There's also a diagnostic page which might give you more information about any potential problems:
http://test-id.org/OP/Sreg.aspx
After using the above page, check the ""recent logs"" link to see what is going wrong.
Bonus Round
Don't wait until after something goes wrong to set up an alternate OpenID in your profile.

N/A
<!-- summary: Short text here -->Longer text here...<!-- summary: abc -->I have a bio, but not an expanded user card




Note that since we allow the above HTML tags, to have tags show up as text you need to escape the < character. You can do this by marking it as code (with indentation or backticks as is done below) or by using the HTML entity &lt;.
Any tags not in the above list will be stripped out of the post. Do note that the sanitizer that strips out tags will recognize any text between < and > characters as HTML, and so any such text will be stripped out of the post; to prevent this, encode those characters as &lt; and &gt;.
Are HTML comments supported?
Yes and no. While they (often) do work in the way you specify, that's not because they're officially supported by the system; they just happen to get removed as invalid HTML. Technically speaking, only the above comments used for special system features (syntax highlighting languages, Stack Snippets, and user card popup summaries) are supported. This fact leads to some quirks and limitations, such as that comments cannot contain the > character even though the HTML specification permits those characters in comments.
Allowed attributes
Attributes are only allowed on <img> and <a>. Other tags with attributes will be stripped.
Allowed attributes for <img>
The following attributes are allowed on the <img> tag, in the order shown below.
Attributes must be specified in this order. You may omit attributes you do not want to specify, but specifying a later attribute before an earlier one will strip the tag.

src=""""
width="""" (1–999; plain number without any extensions like px)
height="""" (1–999; plain number without any extensions like px; pay attention to order warning above)
alt=""""
title=""""

Allowed attributes for <a>
Once again, attributes specified in reverse order to what is shown here will cause the tag to be stripped:

href=""""
This attribute can only hold proper URL links, such as https://stackexchange.com/users/, or relative or protocol-relative URL links such as /q/3122 or //stackexchange.com/users/. They cannot hold other types of links, such as relative fragments (e.g. #3122), or protocols other than HTTP or HTTPS (e.g. javascript, ftp, or mailto). Invalid hrefs will strip the entire <a> tag.*
title=""""

Important Notes

HTML tags unlisted above are stripped from the output. They may render in the client preview, but they will always be removed on the server.
The tags must be entered exactly as shown in the list. Exactly one space must be present between attributes with no spaces between the attribute name, = sign, and double quotes """".

Valid: <a href=""..."">
Invalid: <a  href=""..."">
Invalid: <a href= ""..."">


While it is possible to make tables using Markdown syntax, we do not support the HTML <table> element.

How often do people get serial down voted?,"
I was the recipient of it only one time in the past (and even then it was not that major). I think I disagreed with someone on their answer and voted them down, next thing I know I had about 7 of my older answers voted down in quick succession. 
Some people can be pretty thin-skinned.
Edit: I am editing this because I do take issue with the idea that certain people must ""deserve"" the action because they happen to get on people's nerves or do something else that may be seen as objectionable. 
I find that idea pretty ludicrous. If you are offended by a user, suck it up and deal with it, or if you find it truly abusive, alert the proper authorities. Taking action into your own hands to go and downvote everything you find is not acceptable at all. By downvoting an item, you are giving a subtle clue to future viewers of the answer that it is not correct (when in fact it may be) and you will be providing a disservice to more than just the person you are attacking.
Further Edit If you are the recipient of a case of serial downvoting, take your problem up with the team by mailing team@stackoverflow.com. Often times this will be taken care of with the nightly rep recalc (wasting the efforts of the voter(s)). It will also allow for the moderators/team to inform the offender that their action is not acceptable behavior on SO.
"
Should SO seek to be the home of programming language FAQs?,"
I don't know if it should -strive- to be that...but the longer it stays open and the more questions that roll in, the more it is going to be seen as the standard place to look for information on programming languages.
"
Mark questions to receive notifications and updates?,"
Rather than continue to comment on other's posts. I've decided to open myself up to downvotes by answering.
There have been at least two recent metaso questions related to this issue.
Allowing Editor to notify downvoters
Which is about being able to be notified on edits on only a single post. Not the entire question (RSS feed and/or Favorite)
What level of notification should we have regarding questions we have posted an answer to (or left a comment) ?
Which is about being able to be notified on comments on only a single post that has been commented on. 

Basically, these all fall under the same broad category of being able to get MORE information about specific things that are changing rather than broad strokes.
RSS - doesn't cover this problem, because the RSS is on the entire question, which, if the question is very active, would be an incredible amount of noise if you are only concerned with one answer. Also, as noted in my comments, I prefer my Outlook inbox to be for work emails, but that doesn't mean I don't want to be notified about these things when I log in to SO. 
Favorite - I can favorite a question, but then I have to manually check every one of them to see if any comments have been added, or any of the pieces of it have been edited. And again, I would still need to click through in order to check if the particular post I was concerned with was edited. 

My suggestion for these were enumerated on both the previously linked questions, but I feel it's worth repeating.
Have a checkbox on every individual post that says ""notify me when this is edited"" which would generate a notice in your ""SO Event Feed"" (the thing that shows up when you click the mailbox).
Have a checkbox on every individual posts that says ""notify me when this is commented"" which would generate a notice in your ""SO Event Feed"".
A third option would be to merge those two, since it seems likely that people who want to follow the comments would also follow the edits. 
That way, you could choose precisely what you want to be informed of. 
"
What’s going on with the time conversions on SO?,"
It's only 13:56 UTC at the moment. I think you're mistaken about your time zone. You may be two hours ahead of ""British time"" but UK is on BST now, which is UTC+1, making you UTC+3.
GMT ~= UTC, so I don't think you're really GMT+2.
Where are you, geographically? I can go from a city name to a full Olsen time zone fairly easily :)
"

"
Why call It Supe Use? - Meta Supe Use,"
I think it might have to do with the other name for root. I suppose they could have called it root...but that would have sucked, IMO.
That, and yes, it begins with an S and has a nice acronym (SU). IIRC, the su in the nix sudo command used to mean superuser (today it's an acronym for ""substitute user"")...
So it's just nice all around.
"
No more bronze badges being awarded on SO?,"
We stopped showing bronze on the homepage because they were so commonly awarded. 
Only silver or better are shown.
This is only a display issue and has nothing to do with the badges themselves or how they are awarded.

"
Do closed questions ever get deleted?,"
see https://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/the-stack-overflow-question-lifecycle/

Why would you delete a question? Isn’t closing it enough?

Some questions are of such poor quality that they cannot be salvaged. They’re literally nonsense. Not every byte of data that is created in the world is infinite and sacred.
Some questions are so incredibly off topic that they add no value to a programming community.
The mental cost of processing these closed questions is not zero, particularly for users who are actively engaged and scanning questions to find things they can help answer.
If users see a lot of closed questions, they’ll note that we don’t enforce the guidelines, so why should they? Without any final resolution, asking questions that get closed becomes something we are implicitly encouraging — a broken windows problem. If this goes on for long enough, we’re no longer a community of programmers who ask and answer programming questions, we’re a community of random people discussing.. whatever. That’s toxic.
If enough of these closed questions are allowed to hang around, they become clutter that reduces the overall signal to noise ratio — which further reduces confidence in the system.


"
What purpose does downvoting questions serve?,"
Voting on questions serves a very similar purpose to voting on answers: it provides a visible hint to other readers. Chances are, a heavily down-voted question or answer is not worth the time to read, while one with up-votes might well be worth a look. Even more: since August 2010, downvotes also feed the automated Sorry, we are no longer accepting questions from this account, to filter out low quality questions.
If I have a question and I'm searching for an answer, I want to find an existing question that asks this question (and has good answers for it). I don't want a question that was unclear, because chances are the answers will be similarly unhelpful. Not necessarily - but if there are two questions that match my search, then the one that made it easy to provide a good answer is the one I want to read first.
This is why sympathy votes irritate me - they skew the rating of a question or answer away from the intended ""who found this useful / unhelpful"" scale.
"
Is accepting an answer discouraging more answers?,"
Accepting an answer discourages further answers. A few answers may trickle in after, but many (most?) members care a lot about reputation, so they won't answer anything that's old or that has an accepted answer.
That's why I usually don't accept an answer unless it nails the question. In other words, if, after a day or two, I still have only a collection of partially correct answers, I don't just accept the one that is ""least wrong.""
"
Please add a serial downvote tax,"
To this, I would add: it should only apply to older posts. If someone's flooding the site with reposts of their question (as does happen on occasion), it makes more sense to flag and close them. But I don't see any reason to punish those who down-vote them as well.
"
Should questions and answers show their authors?,"
Attribution of others' material should be hideable at user option.  If one wants to hide identities of others, to minimize one's own bias, one should be able to do that.
Attribution of one's own material should be hideable at poster option for questions and answers.  If one wants to hide identity to avoid unduly influencing responders with one's name, one should be able to do that.  (Except mods, of course, should be able to override and see author.)
Attribution of one's own material should NOT be hideable at editor option.  You modify someone else's content, and your work is visible to all, period.

"Bug report: ""next"" button in search changes the search term","

"
"Should you downvote an answer that ""works"" because it is not strictly ""correct""?","
I would upvote Answer 1 and not upvote Answer 2.  Correctness is about more than just accomplishing the end goal.  In other words the ends do not justify the means.
A good answer needs to not only provide a solution but it needs to provide a solution in a manner that adheres to best practices.
I wouldn't downvote the second answer but I don't think it deserves an upvote along with the better answer simply because it works.
"
"Suggest community wiki based on title keywords, tags","
The rules for what is Community Wiki are so screwed up already I don't know if you could effectively program to look for questions that might be CW status.
I think before we try and provide helpful tips to question askers, we need to figure out what CW actually means first.
It should also be noted that they could easily avoid the little warning by  just not using those tags as well.
"
"""Meta stuff is not building a solution""?","
I don't think you need to worry too much about your involvement. You may use SO primarily to ask questions, but others primarily answer questions, edit posts, fix grammatical errors, and police spammers.
There are many different types of users on SO, and no single type should feel pressured to conform to the behavior of any other type.
Keep asking questions, we'll keep answering, others will fix our grammar, and yet others will keep the noise to a minimum while we all enjoy SO.

"
Make superuser an aggregate of SO and SF Reputation,"
This I could actually see happening, as opposed to moving rep over from SF to SO and vice versa. If you are intelligent enough to rack up massive reputation on SO and SF, you could theoretically be seen as a knowledgeable enough person to have high rep on SuperUser.
Plus, with the hordes of noise that is inevitable on that site it may be a good idea to have a lot of high-level users there to help clean it up immediately. 
Another idea, which may be easier to swallow for some of the masses...just make it a one time synch. When you join SuperUser your rep is initially set to your total from SF and SO, but it wouldn't grow along with your other rep if you don't put in the effort on SuperUser
Edit: mmyers brought up a nice idea about capping the initial rep score at 10,000 if there was a one time rep score set to your SO + SF reputation. This would allow us to still start on a fairly level ground with the really big reputation scores that are already present on SO.
"
"Should SO allow ""give me some feedback"" questions?","
This was asked a while back on SO itself concerning ""code reviews"" and it received positive feedback. I actually posted a Code Review question myself and it turned out well. I received some very good critiques and took that advice towards building a better DAL.
As long as there isn't a super massive chunk of code and the author of the post is pretty clear about what areas he is looking for critiques on, I don't see a problem with it.
Edit: Here is the actual topic I posted. Code Review: ADO.NET Data Access Utility Class (VB) (yes, there is what you might consider a super massive chunk of code in there).
Edit 2: If the author of the post doesn't make it look like he is putting any decent effort into his question (such as being clear about what he is looking for help on or what specific areas to look at), then it is unlikely to receive much feedback from the community except close votes. In the cases of pure author laziness, I would probably vote to close myself. But if it looks like someone actually put a concerted effort into getting some useful feedback from the community, try it out and see how you can help the author.

We had this originally (actual count) and it caused no end of friction. You have ""enough"" votes until you get close to running out, at which point we tell you how many are left.

once you get below (n) votes the count is displayed
above (n) votes the count is not displayed

"
"How can we retire ""What is the worst programming language?"" with dignity?","
I don't think a question about what is the ""best"" or ""worst"" of much of anything is going to suffer a kind fate on StackOverflow. You are going to make it very argumentative with a lot of hurt feelings (you know how programmers are with their favorite languages). I don't know if it was community wiki or not, but if it wasn't, it probably should have been in the least.
"
Ability to sort/reorder interesting/ignored tags in sidebar,"
I don't agree with ""Olafur Waage"" in that's too much work with little benefit.
I will repeat an update I made to my own question (when I asked the same question as the one you're reading now - silly me - my question is now flagged as duplicate):

However, having read those others, I
  have a suggestion for the developers:
  clearly you are now keeping a list of
  selected tags in a table. 
If you add one integer field to this
  table, and give us a 'upvote' link
  (like you have now in front of a
  comment), we could very easily alter
  the order of tags (if you would show
  them according to this new field).

"
To change the 30-second time limit in comments,"
I'd either like to see an edit capability for my own comments, or I'd like to see this time limit waived once, for 30 seconds, if I've deleted one of my own comments. This would allow me to immediately replace the deleted comment, without permitting spam - it would be one deleted comment exchanged for one new one.
"

This is getting more important with suggested edits.  We need to be able to hover over a tag and see if it was 'made-up' or if it is an established tag.

"
Please add a 'Migrate to Meta.StackOverflow.com' link on SO,"
I think it would be nice if users could migrate even non-closed questions.
"
What has happened to the quality of answers on Stack Overflow?,"
Okay, here's my 2 cents.  You ask a very legitimate, but very complex question.  Generally this is a question that you would put to an architect, not a developer.  And then you ask ...

""So what is the best solution?""

Points I think you need to recognize about your question: (1) it's hard; (2) it's not typical for SO; (3) it's targeted at architects.  So, the only people that are going to be able to answer you are: (1) someone who has done this before; (2) an architect that decides to sit down and spend an hour or more researching the problem and composing an answer.
Recognizing #1, it's a hard problem, you get typical answers of the type ""did you push back?""  Those make sense.  To those reasonable responses, you say ...

I cannot simply say, sorry, why don't
  you try a more traditional approach
  and to suggest doing so is naive.

I push back on requirements for a living, so I think your statement is actually the naive one.  I have actually been blamed by customers for not pushing hard enough do dissuade them from a bad course of action after something I recommend (strongly) against blew up in their faces. 
Then you get a smart ass ""hey give them Java and say go for it!""  And you let it drag you down and you start to pop-off.  As such, you lose any credibility in the question that you may have had.  That answer should have been water off a duck's back.
You got legitimate answers (not the answers you wanted) and you immediately went ad hominem with your response (""you're naive!"")  Personally, I think your expectations of SO are too high.

I know some people find the notification alerts annoying, but myself think they aren't used enough. I would love to see more of those alerts so that I could keep better track of what is happening on the site as I am using it. They aren't terribly obtrusive and they are simple enough to dismiss.
"
Please detect serial down voting and generate a pop up and a limit to disallow voting on that user,"
To generate some sort of working algorithm for preventing serial downvoting. You would have to look at the logs of a real serial downvote and gather points from that.

Is the user only downvoting new answers by the target
Is the user doing this over a large period of time?
Has the user ever upvoted the target?
Are there sudden bursts of downvotes to a question that isn't on the front page (or a recent question)?

"Please show the tags associated with each question listed in the ""Related Questions"" section of the ""Ask a Question"" page","
Here a abstract form hour discussion in the Gaming Thread.

Example : ""how-can-i-kill-the-president"" tag ""fallout 2""
but the question ""how can I beat the final boss"" could be more problematic, since it's a common concept in many games. Not having this tag displayed in ""Related Questions"" section of the ""Ask a Question"" page would be useful.
"
Notify user when their name is mentioned in comment,"
I don't see why this feature requires unique names. As long as we have some unique way of identifying users (i.e., their ID), we're all set. And users don't even need to be aware of the ID's.
Here's how it would work:
When I post a comment, I am given three options to choose from (in the form of radio buttons):


Don't notify me of any new comments
Notify me only if a commenter tags me
Notify me of all new comments.

(Note: You can change your selection at any time.)

Then users who post subsequent comments could tag any user of an existing comment using a drop-down checkbox list, like this Notify [checkbox list \/] of my comment. This list would contain only the names of users who had agreed to allow someone to tag them, and perhaps it could include the first few words of the first comment that user left in case there happens to be two users with the same name/alias (and also just for general user friendliness, in that it makes it easier to match a name to a particular comment).
Pros:

No one receives notifications (gets ""tagged"") who doesn't want them, and they can decide on a comment-by-comment basis. They should be able to change their selection at any time in case they change their mind.
Those who are willing to receive notifications are notified because someone was trying to get their attention, not just because someone said something random that didn't relate to their comment (unless of course they opted for full notification).

Cons:

Adds some complexity.
Tagging? That reminds me of Facebook :(
Someone has to program this.

Note:
This is sort of a fleshed out version of Ian Elliot's comment & waveyλger's answer.
Edit:
Just to clarify, when I say ""notifications"", I mean your little SO envelope icon turns red and you can click it to see your new comment responses. I don't mean it to imply email.
"
Should you gain rep for asking a duplicate question?,"
One big pet peeve of mine is when someone answers a duplicate question with the link to the duplicate instead of doing the proper thing and commenting and/or editing the post itself. The posting of the duplicate link as an answer always seems to me to be a very cheap rep gaining ploy. So if people didn't get rep on questions closed as duplicate I probably would not be upset.
On closing a question as duplicate:

Question asker loses all rep gains or losses
Answers lose all rep gains or losses

On reopening a question that was previously closed as duplicate

Question asker has the rep reapplied
Answers have rep reapplied.

"What is the difference between ""hot"" and ""active"" questions?","
I think Hot is taking into account a different measurement of the ""velocity"" of that question such as number of views, number of votes, and number of answers within a given time frame. Active questions are questions that have immediate activity on them (i.e. a question with a new answer is immediately bumped up).

Community Wiki Allows for Gaming to get badges,"
There's certainly a discrepancy in terms of CW granting badges but not rep. Big deal? Maybe, maybe not. Personally I'm not terribly bothered by it.
Now, as for gaming the system: there are various ways of gaming the system to get more badges - fewer for rep, but I dare say it's possible. The problem is that any ""fix"" to that is likely to harm the system too. For example, suppose someone does create an answer just by grabbing all the best bits of other answers. That's improving the site by collecting all the information together. In an ideal world, the other posters would then delete their original answers, leaving one definitive answer. That's good for the site, but bad for individuals in terms of ""unfair"" rep and badges.
Basically there's a tension between what's good (and fair) for an individual and what's good for the site as a resource. The system has been designed to keep the two goals in line as far as possible, but it's never going to be perfect.
Personally I would favour leaving the system as it is until there's evidence of widespread gaming which doesn't improve the quality of the site.

This is really a request for Fog Creek.
At the very least, Fog Creek should be geolocating the IP.

"
Why show captcha when an answer takes too long,"
Since the page shown is a hip reference to a FOTC video about robots, I've always imagined that there was (or still is) a robot in the wild that deliberately takes a long time between a form fetch and a posted answer.
It must be thinking that returning a form with 1K characters in a field only 100 ms after fetching the page would obviously not happen with a human, so it should wait for a while before answering.
So it waits. And since we get the ""I'm a human"" page after several (ten?) minutes, it must wait quite a while.
Unfortunately, the threshold time that causes the CAPTCHA page seems to be just about as long as it takes to actually verify the facts of an answer as well as get distracted by at least one unrelated Wikipedia link and possibly one phone call from a customer wondering if you've finished his project (that he hasn't authorized to start) yet.
Edit: I've expanded and tried to clarify the point I wasn't making as well as I could have.

What's the recommended syntax for an image with a link?,"
It is possible to use Markdown for both the image and the link.
You have to do it manually because the the toolbar's default behavior
is to make the clickable image point to the URL of the image itself.


Reference-style
[![alt text][image]][hyperlink]

[hyperlink]: https://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/44330/jason-s
[image]:
https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dd5a7ef1476fb01998a215b1642dfd07
(tooltip)
  – or –
[image]:
https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dd5a7ef1476fb01998a215b1642dfd07
""tooltip""

Example

Default behavior, reference-style
Since July 2015 the insert
image feature (Ctrl + G) of the toolbar of the
Stack Exchange Markdown editor by default adds a clickable link to the
image itself.
1
It uses the following syntax:
[![enter image description here][number]][number]

where number is an automatically generated number.
Default example, reference-style
[![Jason's avatar][1]][1]

[1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/X14m7.png
""Tooltip for Jason's avatar""


To change the link to something else, simply change the second
[number] with (*your URL here*) (in parentheses) or use the
reference style syntax above.


Inline-style
[![alt text](image ""tooltip"")](hyperlink)
  for example:
[![invisible description of images, read aloud to blind users
](https://i.stack.imgur.com/X14m7.png
""Let's check Jason S' profile page (inline-style)"")
](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/44330/jason-s)



Default behavior, inline-style
You can get the default behavior without using the [number]
construct.
[![A click on the image links to its own URL.](
https://i.stack.imgur.com/X14m7.png
""A click on the image links to its own URL (inline-style)."")
](https://i.stack.imgur.com/X14m7.png)



The observant reader will notice that to achieve the inline-style
default behavior, the URL to the image must be supplied twice.
The first link is there to display the image, the second link
makes the image clickable.

Badgs for claning up - Mta Stack Exchang,"

Closed 10 or 20 questions with a unanimous vote
Closed 10 or 20 questions as duplicate

This prevents (or tries to prevent) negative and pointless voting to get badges. Since you have to select a duplicate and you have to select a correct close type.
There is one problem though with the first one. It forces that people vote the same if they want to get the badge. So if the first person picks the wrong thing, the others have to pick the wrong thing with him to get a badge.
"
Is the Critic badge awarded prematurely,"
Awarded badges are not removed, by design.
Jeff Atwood has mentioned this on a few occasions: ""Badges are almost never removed. You do not lose the badge once you have it.""
So if, for example, you left 10 comments (Commentator badge) and then deleted one, you would not lose the badge.

Some reductions in CAPTCHA throttle thresholds, if you have > 10k rep:

for post submission times -- min seconds reduced by one half, max minutes increased by 2x

additionally: assuming you are a logged in user and have >= 200 reputation, after successfully completing one captcha we now suppress captcha for 5 minutes on your account.
"
Turn answr into commnt - Mta Stack Exchang,"
Something tells me this would be difficult to implement.  First, what does it become a comment of, the question?  Second, how do you resolve any potential formatting, code blocks, etc.  Third, what if it's bigger than 600 characters?
Even if you pick answers to those questions, they're going to be arbitrary.  I just don't think this provides any improvement over the current system of commenting on the question, downvoting, and if necessary, flagging for a moderator.  In fact, I'd argue that it's substantially worse than the current system.

If you answer a question that has gotten the tumbleweed badge (or a similar criteria) and for each upvote you get, you get a bonus +5 rep (or something) until some criteria is hit.
"
What is syntax highlighting and how does it work?,"
What is syntax highlighting?
Syntax highlighting allows code in posts to be highlighted based on the language it's written in, to make it easier to read.
How does it work?
When creating or editing posts, syntax highlighting is assigned to the preview based on question's tags as soon as you stop typing for 5 seconds.
Stack Exchange does not have its own syntax highlighting engine. It uses highlight.js, and may not necessarily be using the latest release of that library. Therefore, any bugs and feature requests regarding syntax highlighting cannot be handled by Stack Exchange.
Why isn't my code being highlighted correctly?
1. Check that the site you're using has syntax highlighting enabled
The full list is available on Meta. If syntax highlighting is not enabled on a site, follow the instructions at the bottom of the answer there.
2. Make sure you're specifying a language code or the tag exists on a site
In case of a tag name make sure to also specify it in lower case. See How do I use syntax highlighting? section below for more info.
2a. Check that the language is supported on Stack Exchange
See Language codes currently available on Stack Exchange section below. If your language is not on the list, follow the instructions in How do I report a bug or request a new language? section below.
2b. Check that the tag has a language code associated with it
Each tag may have a highlighting language specified in its properties. Visit the tag's wiki page to see it: click on the tag you've found at step 2 (such as javascript), then click ""Learn more..."". The language code that is currently being used for the tag (if any) will be displayed at the very bottom, below the wiki buttons:



If the tag doesn't have a highlighting language specified when it should, create a feature-request on your site's per-site meta to request it. (Only moderators can change the highlighting language for a tag.)
3. Check that the tags on a question have an associated language codes
By default, Stack Exchange uses the tags on a question to determine the language you are using. If there's more than one tag that has a highlighting language specified, it lets highlight.js infer what's the best language to use. If none of the tags have one, no syntax highlighting will be performed. The same highlighting language that is used on a question is also used on its answers.
How do I report a bug or request a new language?
Reporting a bug or requesting a feature for a language supported on Stack Exchange
Go to the list of existing issues in highlight.js GitHub repository and check to see if your request is already filed there, and if not, post it there.
If your bug fix or feature request has already been fixed or implemented by highlight.js but isn't working here, please wait, as new versions of highlight.js are deployed on the sites on a scheduled basis, and the latest version hasn't been deployed yet. (If it hasn't been deployed after a long time, you can post a feature request here on Meta asking that Stack Exchange update to the latest version.)
Keep in mind that Stack Exchange does not maintain this syntax highlighter (aside from installing newer versions of it), and posting bug reports or feature requests concerning it here on Meta will not get them fixed or implemented.
Before you do anything, make sure that you've got the correct highlighting turned on.
Requesting that Stack Exchange support a new language which is already supported by highlight.js
If a language is already on the list of languages supported by highlight.js, but is not supported on Stack Exchange (see Language codes currently available on Stack Exchange below), you can raise a feature request here on Meta to ask for it to be deployed on the network.
While it's fine to request for the SE team to add additional supported languages, these requests are extremely likely to be considered low-priority and as such deferred. The current response for such feature requests is that the team finds that the added trade-offs from supporting more languages outweigh their potential benefit, though they're looking for future ways to lighten it.
Requesting that a new language which is not currently supported by highlight.js be added
Follow the instructions in Reporting a bug or requesting a feature for a language supported on Stack Exchange above to request that highlight.js support your new language. Once the language is supported by highlight.js, follow Requesting that Stack Exchange support a new language which is already supported by highlight.js to make it available here on Stack Exchange.
How do I use syntax highlighting?
As long as all the conditions in the Why isn't my code being highlighted correctly? section above are satisfied, highlighting of code blocks will kick in automatically based on the question's tags. (See 3. Check that the tags on a question have an associated language codes section above for how this works.) Inline code is not highlighted.
It is possible to explicitly override the default highlighting language in use on the post with your language of choice for a specific code block, by specifying a language hint above the code block. Note that this is only supported when using the code fence (```) method of code formatting; since the implementation of CommonMark, doing so on code blocks using the four-space indent method is no longer supported*:
```lang-or-tag-here
code goes here
```

You may use either a language code or a tag name in a language hint to activate syntax highlighting. See below for the complete list of language codes supported on Stack Exchange.
For example:

Here is a code block with language code (having the ""lang-"" prefix) as a hint:
```lang-js
function greet(person) {
    return ""Hello "" + person;
}
var user = ""Jon Skeet"";
alert(greet(user));
```

Renders as:
function greet(person) {
    return ""Hello "" + person;
}
var user = ""Jon Skeet"";
alert(greet(user));


Here is a code block with tag name (without ""lang-"" prefix) as a hint:
```typescript
var arr = [0, 1, 2];  // will highlight if [typescript] tag exists
```

Here on Meta Stack Exchange, this renders as:
var arr = [0, 1, 2];  // will highlight if [typescript] tag exists


If you don't want to have any syntax highlighting, you can use the lang-none language code:
```lang-none
[code here]
```

Renders as:
[code here]



You can also apply a language hint to all code blocks in your post, so you don't have to add a hint before each one, by adding an HTML comment at the top of your post. The hint will then be applied to all code blocks within your post, including those which use four-space indent or HTML <pre><code>:
<!-- language-all: lang-or-tag-here -->

Note that when used on a question, it does not override the highlighting language on its answers; those will still be highlighted by default as per the question's tags.

Language codes currently available on Stack Exchange
This is a complete list of every identifier that you can use in a language hint for syntax highlighting. All the language identifiers in each group point to the same highlighter. Other language aliases set by highlight.js (in brackets) should work, but only identifiers before them are officially supported by Stack Exchange.

Any language identifiers used in a post that go unrecognized by highlight.js will be ignored and will trigger an automatic language detection.
Hinting: Tags
You can specify any tag that exists on the site, and Stack Exchange will use whatever language hint is currently associated with that tag to highlight the code block (which can be either null (no hint, no syntax highlighting), default (automatic language detection), or a specific language code). Keep in mind that by default all tags start off with null as their language hint!
You can also use the plain none keyword to manually specify no syntax highlighting, similar to using the lang-none code above.

* The former method of specifying a highlighting language can still be used for HTML code blocks: place an HTML comment <!-- language: lang-or-tag-here --> before the <pre><code> tags and it will work. This:
<!-- language: c -->
<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h>
int main() {
  printf(""Hello World"");
}
</code></pre>

will render as
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  printf(""Hello World"");
}

Also, this former method hasn't been completely removed for four-space indented code blocks, but merely deprecated. While it will still work for the time being on four-space indented code blocks, it may/will be removed in the future.


Note to editors:
Please do not edit the above list manually.

Just because you type something in and it looks like it's highlighted correctly does not mean the identifier actually exists in the system. Keep in mind that invalid identifiers trigger an automatic language detection.
Not all the languages supported by highlight.js are available everywhere. The set of languages available depends on how the library is built or included.
Additionally, several languages that are indicated as supported in highlight.js's documentation may also not be supported by Stack Exchange version of highlight.js, as they are in separate modules which may not be deployed on Stack Exchange.

Because of these points, to update the list please use the script it was generated with and link to this script (or another Meta post which confirms an identifier's existence) in your edit summary.
Note to commenters:
The comments on this FAQ are for requesting clarification of something you might not understand in the FAQ so that it can be fixed. Please DO NOT ask if certain languages will be supported in the future. Follow the instructions in How do I report a bug or request a new language? section to request language support.

Here is the query if you're curious:
select
    uuser.id,
    uuser.displayname,
    count(post.id) as ans,
    count(vote.id) as acc,
    1.0*count(vote.id)/count(post.id) as pct
from uuser
        join post on (uuser.id = post.owneruserid)
        left join vote on (vote.postid = post.id)
    and post.posttypeid = 2
    and vote.votetypeid = 1
    group by uuser.id, uuser.displayname
    order by ans desc;

"
Odd Reputation Number: 90 + 20 + 10 = 121?,"
You, me, everyone gets a 1 to start off with, and your rep can never drop below 1 even if you get down-votes that should take you into negative territory.
I don't know whether there are reasons for this. Unless it's must have rep > 0 to post.
"
Daily reputation cap effectively counts downvotes twice,"
It doesn't count twice, the voting system is just inconsistent by design and this generates lots of corner cases. Like at 190 rep upvote then accept answer yields a different result to accept answer then upvote. Personally I think it should be fixed because it looks bad and looks like a bug (and imho is a bug).
As for Jon's point about the devs having enough to do, frankly I think the solution to this is trivial. Just put rep in two buckets:

Soft cap: upvotes (+10) and downvotes (-2) received, limited to 200 per day;
Hard cap: downvotes given (-1), answer accepted (+2 given, +15 received), bounties (variable).

And then the system is completely consistent.
"
Create RSS feeds on a set of tags,"
To subscribe to a single feed for multiple tags, use ""or"" in the URL. For example, if I wanted to subscribe to the questions tagged status-completed or status-declined here, I would use the following URL:

https://meta.stackoverflow.com/feeds/tag/status-completed+or+status-declined


You can also use this trick when browsing with tags:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python+or+django

"
Contribut to bounty? - Mta Stack Exchang,"
Variations upon this theme have been suggested before. My usual concern is the added complexity of things like adding bounties to other people's questions and who chooses the answer or potential hijacking issues.
But this proposal is far more limited and thus far less complicated. You should probably limit it by saying you can't top up a bounty within, say, 2 days of it expiring and point out that the winner is still selected by the OP. Other than that, I see no real problem with this.
One issue worth discussing however is should this extend the deadline for the bounty?  I'm thinking not but maybe there is an argument for doing so.
"
Polarity of conflict between upvotes and downvotes?,"
Actually, the vast majority of people upvote a lot more than they downvote. There are really two reasons for this. First, people like rewarding good behavior much more than they like punishing bad behavior. Second, the rep loss from a downvote provides some disincentive (as opposed to upvotes being free).
Stu Thompson has created an interesting graph that plots upvotes (Y axis) vs. downvotes (X axis) of high-rep users:

"
Are there any clones/alternatives for running a Stack Exchange style Q&A site?,"
Stack Overflow for Teams, a hosted solution, is available for use. In the past there was an enterprise version of Stack Overflow, but this is now deprecated.
But if that does not meet your needs, there are several third-party tools that try to clone at least some of the functionality here.

How is the Birthday field kept private?,"
It's always seemed strange to me that the field exists at all. After all, if age, why not race, sex, politcval affilation etc? I have no problem about people knowing my age , and have mentioned it in several of my SO posts, but its presence in the profile is a bit peculiar.
"
Rjcting an Accption - Mta Stack Exchang,"
You can correct your answer... Take it as an opportunity to educate others who might have made the same mistake you did as to 1) why your original answer was wrong, and 2) what the better solution is.
"
Notify us when an answer we've accepted has been edited,"
I recently had this exact situation happen in reverse. I answered a question, which was then substantially edited. My answer was subsequently down voted because it was a poor answer to the edited (and completely different!) question.
This is pretty harsh, since I don't see that I did anything wrong, but I can see why a viewer faced with the current question would come to the negative decision.
I think some way of linking specific versions of answers to versions of questions would be helpful, or at least some sort of visual cue indicating the edits have taken place.
"
Notify us when one of our posts is edited,"
I agree - this feature can be useful as a way to teach new users how to improve their questions, especially if a description of what was edited will be available as well.
"
Why have so many users given '1920' as the year of birth?,"
Actually, I suspect that the ""89 year old"" users are simply using the oldest date they're allowed to by the system. If you try to set your birth year before 1920, the system will return an error:

Oops! There was a problem updating your profile:
Birthday - must be after 1920/01/01

"
Improved titles for comments in user feeds,"
good idea; implemented!
"
Show reason for edit without clicking through to diff?,"
I'm not sure what benefit this will provide. While I do think it's important to be able to review the revision history and the change notes, I don't think it's necessary to include that information on the main page. When you're viewing a post, you should see what it is, and not be concerned with how its different from its previous revisions.
"
What is the right way to make a feature request?,"
The answer is #1, keep it all together. Though StackOverflow and ServerFault stricly require the question/answer model, the rules have been relaxed here. The reason the site still says things like ""question"" and ""answer"" is because it's going to take a little time to make the necessary changes toward a more discussion-oriented site.
Incidentally, this does not mean that questions will no longer be allowed or even no longer be the predominant method of starting a topic, just that other forms of discussion will also be permitted.
"
Allow extending bounties by topping them up (within limits),"
Totally agree. I am now willing to put a bounty on a question I asked, and requires some skills, so the bounty should be high. The question is complex, and unlikely to attract a lot of contributes. Together with the summer period, I am almost guaranteed to invest maybe 300 reps with poor or no perspective of an effective return. The bounty system is a very good idea, but as it stands, it definitely has flaws.
"
Notify us when the question has been edited after posting an answer,"
This is a good suggestion. I've been downvoted before simply because the question was edited changing the validity of my answer. Most people tend to realize this is whats happened but some don't. It would be good if there were such a notification so you could modify or delete your answer, as appropriate.
"
Please improve the auto-linking to allow square and round brackets,"
examples removed as they are now obsolete -- we do auto-encode parens and brackets now.
Bottom line, in all cases you'll have to encode the space and comma.
"
"Please enhance the ""Recently awarded to"" badge page","
I'm cross-posting this here because they're duplicates (referring to this post) and I'm unsure as to which should win out. After one gets closed, I'll delete it from that one, I suppose:
Maybe not have the questions displayed on the badge page, but in a user's profile, mark the question with the badge that was awarded for it. For example:
[25] How awesome is this place? [* Great Answer] [* Necromancer]

I know that finding where your badges is supposed to be part of the search and destroy fun, but honestly, I'm not going through somebody's entire answer history to find out what the heck they won't leave dead to get the Necromancer badge.  For question/answer specific badges, this is a solid idea, and would be really neat to see.
"
List the questions/answers not the users that received a badge,"
I've always wanted the ability to be able to click on badges and see what actually was the recipient of that badge. I pretty much agree with this suggestion 100%.
"
Is there keyboard navigation of questions and answers?,"
I have not seen any real method of keyboard navigation outside of your standard keyboard navigation for the web browser, and this has a tendency to skip over some things like the vote mechanisms and other AJAX-esque elements.
"
Question summary may cut off at the middle of an entity,"
Good idea, so I'll just greedily take up to 200 characters, as many as I can, until I hit a space:
var r = new Regex(@"".{0,200}\s"", 
    RegexOptions.Compiled | RegexOptions.Singleline);
return r.Match(body) + separator;

"
Reputation Limits and the Rollover Minutes Concept,"
I'm thinking it's a pretty large system change to prevent people from losing a few rep. 
You already have 200 rep for the day and got an accepted answer, and are worried about the 2 rep you lost and didn't get back when someone else upvoted you later on the day?
"
Would hiding OpenID on profile pages be a good idea?,"
I don't see any real logical reason why it HAS to be displayed. I agree that it should at the very least be a preference to show or not (perhaps hidden by default).
Edit Actually it is hidden to other users. You can see yours in your profile, but not others, so this is more or less just something that needs to be closed as ""not actually a problem""
Edit 2 if this is asking for the ability to -make- it visible, I don't have a problem with it, but I don't find much use for it overall.
"
"Is SO able to create stable, live ecosystem?","
Natural ecosystems allow for a multitude of organisms to thrive in them. StackOverflow has taken a stance to only cater towards certain subject matter (and even then certain types of questions).
If we were to start organizing the same way natural ecosystems organize, we're going to end up seeing and growth and abundance of the ""weeds"" which are analogous to all the noise questions which don't benefit StackOverflow.
I'd rather have a clean lawn and garden rather than a weed-overgrown backyard.
"

Can I put a bounty on a CW question?,"
Yes, whether or not the question is Community Wiki makes no difference to the bounty system.
"
Collaborative Answers / Point-Sharing,"
At the moment I don't edit posts for rep - but then again I only edit posts to fix glaring typos/grammar or formatting issues.
If there was the potential of rep on offer then I might be inclined to edit more posts and make more extensive edits to those posts. At some point I might even make the post worse that it was before or twist the sense away from what the originator intended. This would be a bad thing.
Editing with no thought of reward is probably the best approach. It means you edit because you think the post needs improving. If the OP disagrees they can always roll back.
NOTE: This was written before they opened up editing to all and sundry giving a +2 to accepted edits. I'm all for this.
"
Why do you cast downvotes on answers?,"
If I see a bad answer at 0 votes, I generally leave a comment to give the poster a chance to correct or delete it (since the first downvote has been known to trigger a flood of pile-on downvotes). If I check back later and find that it is still wrong and not deleted, I will then downvote.
If a bad answer has already been voted up into, say, the top two or three answers, I will both comment and downvote. I don't want bad answers to be above good answers.
As for what I mean by a bad answer, I would say #1 and (on rare occasions) #6; however, in practice these kind of answers rarely stay around long enough for me to downvote (thus the 27 downvotes in my profile).
For #2, #3, #4, and #5, I'll simply leave a comment. For #8, I'll flag the answer; that already knocks the answer down a notch and potentially leads to -100 reputation for the answerer, so I see no need to penalize both the answer and myself by downvoting also.
"
Are there any statistics kept on RSS feeds?,"
There's no way to reliably determine this.. IP's are dynamic, readers like Google Reader could account for numerous readers (or numerous IP addresses).
The only reliable way would be to have a unique user identifier in the feed URLs, and that would only work for registered/logged in users (which would be a bulk of them, most likely).. 
Anything like this would require the RSS feed URLs to execute code, rather than be dumb cached files, which would increase the server load, all for something of fairly limited interest.
I think there's more interesting statistics that could be calculated/displayed first, perhaps number of view from Google vs number of views from within StackOverflow?
"
Is there documentation on how to use Stack Overflow?,"
The best resource right now is the FAQ for Stack Exchange sites.
"
"Why might I lose 2 rep ""invisibly""?","
If you were at your rep limit and was awarded 15 through an accepted answer, a downvote would take away 2, and then if it were removed you would still be unable to recoup that rep because you were technically over the limit and any further upvotes would not count.
I posted an example similar to this in my suggestion about banking reputation points.
"
Licncing cod snippts - Mta Stack Exchang,"
Anything you post on StackOverflow and its sister sites is automatically placed under a Creative Commons license. As such, all anyone needs to do to use the content is to follow the terms of that license. However, since the person requested to use your code in a production codebase that likely cannot be placed under a Creative Commons license (as is required by the license) then they will have to contact the owner of the content (in this case, you) to obtain a different license. Unfortunately, there is no mechanism built into StackOverflow for contacting another user (yet).
Alternatively, if you wish to dual-license (GPL, public domain, etc) your content here, you can put an appropriate note in your ""About Me"" section of your profile and people can choose the license under which they wish to use your content. Note that this will only apply to content you create - if you edit an answer, that answer cannot be relicensed without that owner's consent as well.
"
What are the architecture details of Stack Overflow?,"
This has actually been asked before and has been covered in the StackOverflow blog (and I am sure somewhere in the FAQ).

"
Questions and answers should not be allowed to contribute a negative score to overall reputation,"
That just shows the system is working. The idea is that if you write something which the community deems wrong/misleading/etc, you will lose the community's trust a bit.
You deleted the answer, so by the community's judgement (which can be wrong occasionally, admittedly) the world became a better place again.
"
How long do deleted questions live in the system?,"
They don't actually get deleted (at least in non-exceptional cases), but once deleted you need 10K rep to be able to see them.  If you know the question number, you should be able to see your own deleted question, however.  Using the question number you can build the URL that will take you there.
I did a basic search via google using your user name and ""deleted by"" and didn't come up with anything.  Perhaps if you could give me (us) some keywords that would fit, I could find it for you and give you the question number/link to the question.
"
When you hover over the name of the person closing a question it should show the reason they've chosen,"
I like it that you suggest a hover, it wouldn't take up space in the UI, kinda like the net votes thingy on posts
"
"Dealing with persistent trolls: ""see the newsgroups guy""","
I'd just keep deleting them as they come - i.e. your current course of action.
As you say, you can't do anything systematic about it to ban him. If he is actively trolling (i.e. he knows he's being unhelpful and he's trying to irritate people) then fretting about it is just feeding that desire.
If everyone just deals with trolls in the simplest way possible, hopefully they'll get bored. That's certainly been the standard advice on newsgroups etc for years. It doesn't always work, of course: if a dedicated group of trolls ""attacks"" a newsgroup, reducing the signal to noise ratio below any useful level, it can sometimes effectively spell the end of that newsgroup. Fortunately I see no sign of that happening on SO - yet. As the site gathers momentum, it will become more of a target, of course. My guess is that SuperUser will be trolled more than SO/SF/MSO.

How to handle a resubmission of a feature request?,"

A new question with a link to the original.

This. 
SO doesn't work all that well for extended discussion. Re-opening an old, potentially-crowded question with new ideas seems like a good way to see those ideas ignored or lost in the noise.
There's a bit of precedent for this on SO already... I've often seen it suggested to those who are posting questions nearly identical to existing questions, but with some key difference. By explicitly linking to the exiting question, and describing why theirs is different, they're able to avoid wasting time on repeated discussion.

SO-Sit Bar (Minimalistic) - Mta Stack Exchang,"
Not too sure about pinning it to the top of the window (position:fixed), aside from that  it looks quite nice, if a little unintuitive at first (""What are these three little coloured boxes?!"")
An alternative idea, using each site's favicon.ico in the toolbar:

Code:
(function(){
  function GM_wait() {
    if(typeof unsafeWindow.jQuery == 'undefined') { 
      window.setTimeout(GM_wait,100); 
    } else { 
      $ = unsafeWindow.jQuery; letsJQuery(); 
    }
  }
  GM_wait();
  function letsJQuery() {
    $(""<span></span>"")
      .append(""<span class='link-separator'>|</span>"")
      .append(""<a href='http://www.stackoverflow.com'><img src='http://stackoverflow.com/favicon.ico' title='StackOverflow' style='padding:1px'></a>"")
      .append(""<a href='http://www.serverfault.com'><img src='http://serverfault.com/favicon.ico' title='Visit ServerFault' style='padding:1px'></a>"")
      .append(""<a href='http://meta.stackoverflow.com'><img src='http://meta.stackoverflow.com/favicon.ico' title='Visit Meta Stack Overflow' style='padding:1px'></a>"")
      .appendTo(""#hlinks"");

"
Which accounts have more questions than answers?,"

If you really want to know, why don't you download the database dump and examine it. You'll probably find all you want to know and more.

For those without the means or inclination to do so, I'll share my findings. I wrote a query that would scan order users by their question:answer ratio. So as to not point fingers, I haven't included the user IDs, but seeing as this data is publicly available, it's not exactly a big secret who these people are. (note that this is the data from the last dump, which is now over a month old)
ratio   rep     #qs    #as
139.0   3556    278     2   
137.0   1041    137     1
111.0   566     111     1
78.0    491     78      1
60.66   886     182     3
36.0    1106    36      1
35.0    237     35      1
35.0    830     35      1
34.0    461     34      1
30.0    340     30      1
29.0    1102    29      1
29.0    293     29      1
28.0    242     28      1
27.0    426     27      1
26.0    118     26      1

If someone has no answers, their question:answer ratio will be infinite, so I had to query them separately:
#qs   rep
134   1169
98    678
66    292
59    509
57    874
49    958
47    558
44    463
40    461
39    548
39    193
34    173
30    79
30    141
29    1

Looking at this data, I think that this 'problem' is way overblown. The maximum rep that appears here is 3556, which is not that high (all things considered).

"Change date format of ""x hours ago"" tool tip?","

Is the ratio of upvotes to downvotes a meaningful measure of participation?,"

Another potential measure may be the ratio of upvotes to downvotes on your own questions.

I could see that being interesting... Everyone has the same number of votes to give (whether or not they actually do), but the number of votes they can receive is much less bounded. 
"
Users making multiple accounts,"
There are legitimate reasons why someone might end up doing this (lost password, lost cookies for unregistered account, broken OpenID provider...) so I advise against being too quick to jump on them.
That said, various answers and blog posts indicate that the site admins take this very seriously when it is done with malicious intent. If you're concerned about potentially untoward interactions between two user accounts, flag one of them for moderator attention and let the site's moderators know about it.

Unfortunately, the only site option for bookmarking an optimal answer is to bookmark the question.

There are plenty of easy ways to to bookmark an answer in your browser:

right-click the link item under the question
select ""bookmark this link""


If your browser does not have ""bookmark"" as a right-click option:

right-click the link item under the question
select ""open in new tab""
in the new tab, click the bookmark function in your browser (this is usually a little star icon near the address bar)

Recent big cleaning of reputation in ServerFault?,"
Say hello to an un-documented side-effect of ""rep recalc"":  
We (as user) shouldn't know anything about this internal stuff, but it appears a reputation recalc cannot take into account votes from questions since then deleted...
And a large ""rep recalc"" seems to be underway following some mishaps with a ""bonus"" to be set when associating accounts...

"Search for questions with tagA, but not tagB?","
The order in which you place the tags matters. If you're searching for questions tagged A and not B, you'll need to put the A before the -B in the search URL:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/php5 -php


Though the search exhibits bugish behavior when you place the negative term first, it's possible this is by design. Consider a search for

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/-this-tag-doesnt-exist


If this-tag-doesnt-exist doesn't exist, then that query would have to return all the questions in the system, a (potentially) costly operation.
There is, however, a bug in the display of the negated tag. Here's how it's supposed to look, according to the blog:

What are the criteria for a Feature-Requests,"
I think there are different classifications:

Feature requests which are invalid due to them not being good ideas
Feature requests which are invalid due to them not being worth the time to develop
Feature requests which are invalid due to the solution already being readily available outside of StackOverflow (such as through a popular web browser extension).
Feature requests which are good but unlikely due to the cost/benefit
Feature requests which are good but unlikely to be implemented for some time
Feature requests which are good and likely to be implemented in fast time frame (such as bug fixes when they are discovered).

We do that for Chat, but it makes sense for chat: how many people are talking in real-time?  
It makes less sense for a Q&A site; while it may appear to operate in real-time, it doesn't, really.  Each post stands on its own, and participants for each post come and go as they please.   The number of participants to the site overall is not really a relevant detail, from this perspective.
The focus for a Q&A site is, and always should be, on the post, not on the participants.

Please ask for confirmation when voting on iPhone,"
I think the answer here is figuring out what the use case is for mobile browsing of this site.  If it's the full experience including answering questions, then I would agree with the arguments that people tend to write long posts, and thus the effectiveness of mobility is less.
My thought is that a mobile version of the site should be created to address this issue. It is mostly a presentation issue, and could easily be developed by the SO team in a reasonably short time period.
However, I don't think the amount of use this would get justifies creating this specialized version.  
"
Should one answer the questionable questions literally or try to look at the big pictures?,"
I would say that the best method is a combination of the two.  Offer the questioner some advice about the best way to do it, but then also try to provide some insight into the way that they are asking it.  This insight may help to show them just why the way they want to do it is not the best, e.g.

I would advise you not to go to Elbonia because there is an outbreak of monkey flu there.  However, if you know for a fact that you do have to go to Elbonia, then I would suggest using a parachute.  Note that if you do use this method, you run the risk of landing on a monkey and thereby catching the afore-mentioned monkey flu.

"
Show all of my question/answers to me even if they are deleted,"
Should this be reconsidered? There are some valid points in Jeff's answer and its comments, but IMO recent changes to SO made this feature request a lot more useful (and less harmful):

Users can no longer undelete posts deleted by moderators.
Users can no longer instantly undelete posts deleted by someone else.
Users with 20k+ rep can vote to delete questions immediately, reducing their exposure


As it is, one needs 10k reputation to see deleted posts made by everyone else. But there is no reputation limit to see your own deleted answers (self-deleted or otherwise). Not only that, but answers deleted by someone else have a link to the FAQ:

Questions on the other hand will vanish without a trace for anyone with less than 10k. They'll be redirected to a 404 page, leaving users with little clue as to what happened. They also get no notifications of any kind.
I tested this by setting up a new account and asking a bad question. Unfortunately it wasn't bad enough and it was taking a while for it to get deleted, so I asked a worse question, which got promptly deleted. There are no notifications, no messages, nada — it just vanishes. (All these links are 10k only.)
Now that 20ks can delete bad questions immediately, it would help to allow anyone to see a list of their deleted questions (i.e. along with non-deleted questions) and access the deleted questions themselves. The comments and the close reason should help everyone but the most clueless to figure out what's the problem(s) with their question and hopefully prevent them from making the same mistake(s) in the future.

When posting an answer, there's a ""Community wiki"" checkbox for making that particular answer CW, even if the whole question is not. I believe this is not a bug.

Move questions between Stack Exchange sites,"
It might be useful to have a way to immediately move your own question before there are upvoted answers - similar conditions as for deleting your own question. 
It happens too often that a question is voted on to belong to another site, but at the same time downvoted too. This could be prevented by immediately moving the question. Especially newbies not aware of the other sites will profit by this.

I believe the appropriate action should depend on the question. 
If the poster is simply asking for someone to write their code for them without putting in any effort themselves, I would downvote and vote to close.
If the poster has demonstrated some prior effort, then perhaps it's down to them not knowing what to search for or how to apply to their problem the information returned from the search. You can help by leaving some hints as comments, and if you choose to do more:

Posting and answering questions you have already found the answer to,"

Having this in mind, is it a good practice to post a question and answer it yourself immediately on stackoverflow/serverfault when you want to share your idea with community?

Absolutely, that is one of the design goals for the site: to be a frictionless technical mini-blog where you get reputation for your hard work.
Since May 2012, you can even write your answer before posting the question: see What is this ""answer your own question"" jazz? here on Meta, and Encyclopedia Stack Exchange on the blog.

Mixing automatic syntax highlighting with manual markup,"
I suspect this would end up being complicated in both implementation and use, but I can certainly see the point.
Another alternative might be to have special line endings which you could then use to refer to particular lines easily later. That might be easier to achieve - so // [1] might be translated into a bold ""1"" which you could then label afterwards.
Admittedly this is entirely based on the Manning book style which I'm familiar with :) I suspect it could work quite nicely on SO though... it depends how easy it is to modify Prettify.
"
Could the tagging system be enhanced to support tag synonyms?,"
I believe that tags on SO should be relatively rigid.  
In general, when tagging media like images, audio, or video that is not otherwise easily indexed, you want a very loose tagging structure that encourages adding as many and as varied tags as possible.  This is because you lean heavily on the tags to index your content for search. It's why flickr and youtube let you tag things any way you want.  
But when talking about text, which is already easily indexed, the tags themselves don't matter for indexing; you index the text directly. The tags don't matter for summarizing; that's the job of the title. Instead, tags are used strictly for categorization. Categorization is a different thing entirely, and it only works if everyone is sorting content into the same set of categories. You need a rigid set of categories for this happen. It's why gmail labels (which are really tags) are harder to just create willy-nilly.  
StackOverflow content is definitely text-based, and that means we should be thinking of rigid tag categories rather than a loose tag cloud.  I've advocated a few changes to the tagging system to help improve things:

done Minimum rep threshold required to create new tags (implemented at 100, I'd like to see it bumped to 250 so that an eager new user has to spend at least more than one day with the site before they can create new tags).
done A better explanation of why the question was rejected would be nice, too.
Add a warning whenever using a tag that appears on fewer than 10 other questions.
Restrict certain junk words like 'and', 'the', 'a', 'server'(on stackoverflow), 'visual', etc from use as tags entirely.  Possibly even do this silently where possible- the tag just doesn't show after you post.
Some synonyms are already tracked and corrected automatically every hour.  This should be done as questions are posted and edited instead.  This way,  users are more likely to notice the tag changed (often the entire question is resolved before the correction, so the user never knows about it) and we reduce time spent by community members correcting these tags that could be more profitably spent elsewhere.  This is also important because by the time a correction is applied the question has fallen off the main page, and users that might have been interested in the question based on the corrected tag will never see it.
done A way for users to nominate tags for merging/elimination/add to synonyms list built into the user interface of the site (not just posting a question here) that allows high-rep users to comment and vote on the nominations via the 10K tools.
Re-name 'tags' to 'labels' ala GMail, to encourage users to think of them in terms of categorization.

"
Could we make tags imply other tags?,"
That almost sounds like an automated method of what I have been doing for a while now when it comes to tagging. I will generally tag something in it's broad category (example sqlserver) and then use the other tags to whittle down the specificity (sqlserver2000, sqlserver2005, sqlserver2008). This would allow for someone to subscribe to the broad tag sqlserver and still see my problem which is specific to sqlserver2005.
Your example of C# and .NET I think showcases a lot of examples of people tagging wrong. If their problem is specific to the C# language I believe it should be C# and you shoudln't have to include .NET at all. If your question is a confusion in the actual .NET framework itself (and therefore not generally C# specific, or VB, etc.) The C# tag isn't exactly necessary.
Again, this is generally I how I view it. 
One question I have would be, does this automatic linkage mean that the tags will automatically display that are linked, and if so, would this take away one of your five allowed tags?
"
What makes a SOpedian's profile worth visiting? (Data dump analysis),"
You can't really trust profile views as a metric of popularity. I know personally that early on I fell into the habit of clicking on my own profile to view my upvotes/downvotes, etc. (this was before the ""little envelope"" functionality was added). I still tend to click on my profile instead of the envelope, thus potentially inflating my profile views.
In short, profile views may be a measure of popularity for some, and narcissism for others. =)
EDIT: You also can't underestimate the ""train-wreck"" profiles: users who give utterly horrible answers, or routinely ask terrible questions. They probably get more views just out of morbid curiosity.
"
Accept Multiple Answers or Split Bounty among Several Users,"
The goal isn't to have multiple answers each containing a piece of the puzzle. It's to have a single, correct, comprehensive answer. Bounty provides a means of encouraging answers to tough problems by offering a reward: allowing you to subdivide this reward creates a situation where you're misleading those participating (who think they're competing for a big prize but only receive a portion of it) and potentially discouraging users from taking the time to write a complete answer.
In short, I think it's a terrible idea. Good, useful answers will be rewarded, by the voters who find them good and useful. If you aren't comfortable with the ""winner takes all"" bounty system, then just don't use it - there's no requirement that you do so ever.

Since the new dump is out now I'd like to say that the dumps are cumulative as of May/June. 
"
Should I ask questions I already know the answer to and answer them myself?,"
As I mentioned in my answer the best approach is to post your question, wait a day or so and then post your answer.
You might get a better answer than you already have and also it's not that obvious that you already knew the answer ;)
"
What's with the prominently placed ads for each question in ServerFault?,"
It's reputation-based.  Your serverfault rep is <200, and users with lower rep see more ads.

"
Is there a way to know which tags I created?,"
If there is I would love to know about it, but as far as I know there is no simple method of finding out who was the first to create a tag. In theoretical terms, you could look for the oldest item with a certain tag, but that is not a guarantee to be the originator because tags can be changed and taken away, so the oldest may have been retagged at some point.
"
Should tags take the form foobar or foo-bar?,"
which way will users search for this term on the broader Internet?
The most important factor by far. For example, I'm about to rename a bunch of tags on Server Fault which are in the form

[windowsserver2008]

I do not believe anyone types ""windowsserver2008"" into Google (or Bing, or whatever). I believe they type

Windows Server 2008

Which means the appropriate tag is 

[windows-server-2008]

.. because dashes are treated as word breaks in every known search engine (and regular expressions, since forever). This is critical to get right because it means people will be able to find what they're looking for.
which form is more popular?
In the case where the search argument cannot be made -- for abstract terms, or technical terms that tend to be a ""lump"" without word breaks -- I tend to argue ""survival of the fittest"". Whichever tag has more questions associated, whichever tag is used by more people, should win.

How's the code for Stack Exchange organized?,"
No secret, it's been mentioned in the podcast a few times.. Podcast #52 mentions this I think, although the transcript is incomplete https://stackoverflow.fogbugz.com/default.asp?W29049:

Atwood: We thought the worst case scenario was that we would literally branch the code.

If I recall right, it's the same code, instances share same server, with different assets (logo, stylesheet), and each with a separate database

Can low level users comment on answers to their own questions?,"
Yes I believe you can comment on your own stuff no matter what rep. I even think i have seen this on many occasions.
"
Details about the flagging mechanism,"
There is a shared queue of items that are flagged as either spam/offensive or moderator.  Users with 10K rep can see spam/offensive, while only moderators can see moderator-flagged.
Moderators can clear the flags on a item to reset it.  It's been my practice to review an item with flags, and if it's a clear-cut case, I'll act or not act on it, and then clear it.  If it's a judgement call, I'll leave the flags, and see if it accumulates more or another moderator sees it as actionable.  (This is pretty unorganized/variable in my opinion, but I work with what I'm given/told, and it hasn't seemed to be a problem here)
Also, the number of items flagged for a mod appear in a red box with a # in the header, so we see those immediately.  So items flagged for a mod are instantly visible to us - so if there's anything crazy-bad, like a porn in an answer, flag it, rather than marking it offensive.  Finally, we see the user who submitted the flag, and the message. 
"
What do the multipliers next to tags mean on the user stats page?,"
How many questions with that tag for which you have posts (answers or question).
