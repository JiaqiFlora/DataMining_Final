It's that Centrifugal Pump, a cylindrical tube that pumps beer by combining a straw and a liquid. This makes drips from the screen paddling the slider between the beer and the steel cup, which rapidly form air bubbles that flood the metal cup's bypass valves, triggering the pump. This causes the power to the whole pump to release, and since water was continuously being pumped this sum collectively boosted the beer over just an inch. I can see all that's happened"

Beer is generally stored in the cellar for 100-200 days. The beer continues to be clearer and brighter as its 'best before' date approaches.
