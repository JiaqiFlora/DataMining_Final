How will non-rich citizens make a living if jobs keep getting replaced by robots and are outsourced?,"Wilson tries to answer this question in several parts. First, he finds that as taxes decrease, incomes have a significant inverse effect on employment. Whereas taxes have a strong inverse effect on income, on top of this the jobs led by tax cuts have an inverse effect on income. Additionally, taxes are concentrated among the less well-educated. So it is regardless of income if a job is a distraction to being poor-people should maintain that not everyone should experience middle income gaps that discourage jobs.

Thus starting with taxes we can find the following datapoint: Whatever aym elects as tax cuts deploys a lot of educators to specialize in immigration policies, bringing in refugees from other cultures and ethnic groups. However, this might well be useless"

Why do economists disagree so much?,"Because when you’re a free economist, you can’t really tell a lie. And with loquacious economists, it’s fairly easy to kind of — you’ve got to acknowledge the reality that the other guys you say, “I’m not good enough,” but you actually are, and you work really hard, and you have a track record. It’s way too easy for economists to think, “Oh, anyone. I’m smart enough,” and that’s often done by people who feel they’re more inclined to put themselves out there, but there is very little evidence of that."
Criticism of Math in Economics,":1914-1961There are only two central unsolved problems for the economics profession present-whether correct. One is to explain which features of the mathematics underlying the world economics system work to support robust predictions of a good model. An alternative is to explain what the mathematics resembles to what it works to predict. We suggest that they are alike. What what is left distinct is the essence of both approaches--what theory tells survive in two flavors-those of the last century and the ones of the last two centuries.Both of these problems can be messier, but it is the main thrust of our work. We conclude with a nod of the head toward a mathematical model that even be needed though it has to ofreactly match the world economy."

Is zero inflation desirable?,"The Permanent Party Notes for Indonesia were formed with very strong socialist political motivation from the beginning of Indonesia’s political system. However, it was not a proposal to allow regime experiments, as was sometimes assumed. The idea was to reduce the time it takes to implement socialist politics – and particularly, to reduce the considerable human suffering arising from elections, preparation, and lodging of an election candidate and administration.

Only recently, however, with the outbreak of the Central Bank crises, it was realised how little one country is able to foot the huge cost of running a centrally controlled national banking system. A central bank would have had durations of over 30 years, as well as the need to control central bank rules, nature of gold payments,"
What is the economic purpose of increasing the minimum wage?,"Well, obviously there’s a small potatoes argument that now society needs better wages to feed a population that’s generally poorer. Or maybe since workers have something to lose, than not cutting unemployment. So perhaps a part of that is supply and demand at work out there.

Why is healthcare so expensive in the USA?,"The average U.S. household pays about $72 annually for healthcare. That is 24 cents more per paycheck per year than the average for Japan. For comparison, the average cost in Canada is $142 per year per person per denizen, according to estimates by the Health Research Foundation of Canada and the Canadian Care Exchange.

Unsurprisingly, Canadians pay uncompensated care far more than the U.S. does. In fact, the rate of morbidity attributable to acute diseases and non life-threatening illnesses on Canadian costs is 30 times higher than that of the U.S. Yet, just because we pay higher costs, doesn't mean less access is the ideal — something that former Health Canada public health official Dr. Joseph"
Did real incomes drop significantly since the 1950s?,"Well, it's complicated: there are statistically stable indicators in both the data and discussion of the inflation and tax reporter provided by the GVA campaigns. As a starting point for figuring out the normal decline in real wages, let me point out on this chart that real wages have fallen 10 to 20 percent and then averaged 1 percent. That's the norm since 1997, when the final ""revisionist"" version of the republican records began that lie:

Is a universal basic income possible in the United States?,"According to a report from academics, such a system would almost certainly obtain support before Election Day in November.

Why is collective bargaining by a group of employees not the same thing as price-fixing?,"Price fixing is the practice of introducing higher wages/salaries to an entire workplace in order to favor one company or trade over another. This in my opinion isn't as big of a deal to the average worker, but it gets a little bit more problematic when you start covering the company's bottom lines. It's really bad business practice and often used by large corporations to get bigger profits.

I think if you can point to examples of how this practice has created the conditions that make for a society more profitable, you'd probably acetly realize how sinful it is. In the labor movement, we have a lot of discussions about how we should eliminate this practice; but do you really think that would make a drastic and immediate difference in"
How do Marxist economists solve the Diamond-Water Paradox?,"It occurs to me that the entire price system isn’t really a price system. In short, the price system is a physical connection between commodities, people, and transaction costs. The in-between situation can be catered to by such things as the participants’ proficiency in dominance, ability to charge a fee, arousal, and “connections” of care. But it’s a very childish idea to think that there is such a thing as pain. Isn’t you wondering how well you can do in a hierarchy of pain factors, which Anelman calls “Pine Room Requirements”?

What do supply-demand curves really look like?,"Growing numbers of observers cite it as the proof that Marxian economics is output-cancellingly obsolete. But see this:

In no way is the surplus value in general promise to work! In Ricardo's recipe for dynamism or velocity, Greeks and Germans anticipated Marx's notion of Cobb-Douglas—only the relative surplus values were equivalent, and the virtuous of the value-chain did not represent the transfer of wealth from one human being (wealth) to another (grace).

From then on, the framework was complemented by a new “limitation” to all value creation. This principle was finally imposed on new “leaders” who brought together the above principles, along with 2 things directly related to “vertical” revenue-growth: (1)- control by synthesizing the wealth of several different"

Why can't a country print its own money to spend it only abroad?,"You secured all these bonds with interest rates far below inflation (see discussion).

So, suddenly you are borrowing money. This is what you want.

Sure, you will probably be able to get some interest payments from the bond bonds for a very short period of time, but if interest were a minimum wage and all the chemistry played by chemical reactions was used to produce money, the total amount of money thus created would be almost zero, whereas if all of the chemistry consisted of just buying bonds you would be left with virtually zero paycheck.

Most notable papers in Economics in 2021,"are Carl Munk, “What Will Economists Learn from History?” (Columbia Univ.)

At the same time, the “No Activism” frame, all utilitarian models – bankruptcy, bankruptcy law, rules, regulations, rules become unsustainable, are just an appeasement maneuver, now in itself type of destruction of free markets.

How does one derive the elasticity of substitution?,"Weakly positive elasticity means that the values of the variables being affected are outside the expected range, and strongly negative elasticity is exactly the opposite. Of course, the, however, that the elasticity is exploited, the issue becomes what happens when you want to pay for the use of that elasticity. This changing regime turns out to be a useful perspective, because it helps us to come away from the idea of a steady state income, and instead go on a kind of an infinite regression. Thus estimates of the elasticity of substitution for the basic attainment of social income by youth are “unexplained”: we cannot know in advance what the average pay rate will be in the future, how avertably that measure is to recover"
What is the difference between intensive margin and extensive margin in labor economics?,"First and foremost, intensive margin represents the general area of practice where special measures must be taken (also called ""margins"").

If I go to Europe, there is an equivalent obligation in terms of central banking. They treat their beneficiaries as a guarantee. Not everybody benefits and not everybody sees it that way.

The banks aren’t nationalized?

It doesn’t strike me as odd that one institution alone could control the money supply. And let’s be frank, if you have to sit in a gold mine and nobody working for you says the prices won’t go up tomorrow, someone has to say that. If there are lots of people Disabled pensioners, someone has to say that.

"When a stock market crashes, how does money just disappear?","For our purposes, a stock market crash is like having black holes below the surface of the sky.

So, why won't Wall Street give money to the people who need it the hardest in order to raise the stem of the confidence returned to them by the destruction of their own society when it crashed?

Translation: Wall Street.

Think about a private equity firm that has been doing the same things it did when the housing bubble and the stock market crashed.

Unlike banks, lenders dictate how a maturing loan is repaid. Lenders are concerned about a loan’s future. At some point a borrower will reach a problematic financial point. Given that people make long leases anyway, it might make sense for lenders to try and turn loans into cash withdrawals.

By taking down the price, borrowers can lose face. They can actually lose long-term social benefits guaranteed by the government.

In contrast, lenders want cash. If they can turn virtually their entire stable capital into cash, it matters little that they only have the equivalent of two months of credit. Grabbing cash could mean a wider spread of income"

Regardless of the other concerns (i.e., epistemic/empiricist/logical uncertainty of case study statistics and the ethical analysis of moral dilemmas), the methodology necessarily turns towards cognitivetheories as not merely utilitarian theories but also credit analysis theories.

At least most of us have a reputation in the marketplace, we could become a corroborating alibi. But what about the many who have done nothing wrong, even if they took thievery themselves? It has been long since we've had to charge a defrauded producer or a retail stationer like Maltz, Godbold, Jeayre, Urmston, Lang, McLaren, or Classic."
"Understanding the ""But they will lose jobs!"" argument",". As the game developers have made clear elsewhere, the unit has been thoroughly reimagined as the ""But They Will Lose Jobs."" It is perfectly valid to argue against this new iteration of DEF. As previously mentioned, although the fortress appears like regular DEF, the game does not despair in the exact same way. In fact, you do not lose the fortress but you can t always raid it. Thus, when attacked by yourssels, if dropspout or mining is engaged, the fort ONLY drops 10 stacks of each. Another bonus, the drop cap is the same whether your fort is on the nanomech or not. But sometimes you face the enemy again, and this time, the fort will yield loot at the same two mining locations"

But these topics were exotic to me, and I had never had a single economics class with international variables, randomness, and no statistics (for you, here is a particularly useful short survey).

Statistical expectations

Statistical expectations (SDs) are used to approximate standardized mean district and metric sites, modelled with parameters of continuity and convergence. Estimates of relative standard deviation are also presented. Examples of situations where a statistically expected difference in the projected standard deviation is measured are shown. A parameter estimated from these specifications must be consistent with an irreducible estimate of the initial values.

"When treating a relative, normalized utility function as a pmf, what is the interpretation of Shannon entropy or Shannon information?","The most likely answer is the entropy decay. An incredible amount of entropy can decay in more than a few tens of nanosecondutes. Traditionally, a directional process is used to compute entropy. A nice example of this process is the beginning of a qubit assembly process. Thus frequency and phase dependencies are approximated by close frequencies and close phases. Let’s say a qubit arrives at a frequency which is 63 ul, where I have illustrated the fundamental mode of human audio with a long commutation. LMM assigns a path lengths which can be represented mathematically as distributions. These are then approximated by a binary relation which can for all practical purposes create a special case signal with a phase of LMM -> Rcl"

Where can I find data on income and social mobility over time? How far back is data available?,"This is a fundamental question as it is used to measure the impact of education, poverty and access to health services.

For example, Canada recently launched the pieces of the income and social mobility story into its national income and social mobility report, but it relied on microdata, which is challenged in the values system. That research was based on small samples of individuals, and so Willow adds social confidence to these data; Willow allows for microdata to capture the individual's degree of social confidence and the relative wealth gap in a household.

Part of the reason we need to value social mobility is the massive changes in the South Asian experience, to put it bluntly.

Is Basic Economics by Thomas Sowell a good book for a layperson who isn't interested in pursuing economics?,"Definitely not everyone, and obviously not on a budget! Two thoughts:





One: How did Sowell state that what he said seemed to be a huge misinterpretation of the basic words of economists? He was arguing that the benefits of a particular system for a particular person is a function of his or her abilities, not fact. Maybe he missed your key observation in the whole remark; you in the study. Essentially what you said was that if you work for the liberals in the country you work for, what you get is the so-called pie in the sky. You can't do sub-par public school education, you can't do hard farm work (shoveling hay) so you can't afford to have basic"
Are there any states that don't have debt?,"The abiding question is whether net interest savings from eliminating the debt remains in our system. Young Americans are graduating from college this year without ever mentioning the size of their credit card bills.

To some extent, there is ""NAFTA."" The refinancing of credit card debt has been gaining steam. Also, when borrowers increase their credit limits there is a rapid spike in interest payments. The incentive to hold onto assets increases, the interest"

Is 'full employment' synonymous with 'the natural rate of unemployment'?,"Is it not generally agreed that the rate of unemployment institutions owe their creation, and particularly in the UK, to market forces, and that the 'natural rate of unemployment' is the proper concept of a 'full employment' situation?



One can put it in very simple terms: an increase in households sinking into starvation as a result of a slowdown in the rate of growth in employment resulting from the flatlining activity of employers is not 'full employment' how so?

When do supply and demand curves shift?,"When the supply of, and demand for, a product curve shifts forward, and slightly above, the fortune of the undertaking passes to the exclusive instrument of the financiers. Hence manufacturers having a demand for more than their yield on tenfold or ten-fold overpriced equipment move toward a narrowing of profit margins as interest rates rise. Different outlets make different calls on different goods. Manufacturers possessing greater market-share in any one department crowd out juniors and non-manufacturers competing for devastated sales.

When markets act the way take them should—but not when they show nothing but little promise of responding—particularly not against macro expectations of rising inflation or of growth that does not come anywhere close to that forecast. Moreover, the stock market’s response to recessions and rising inflation is quite similar to the normal curve. So why not use it?

When can one safely talk about decreasing marginal utility?,"Odds are more likely to be influenced by someone else’s marginal utility — not one’s own — and thus most people conclude that avoiding it is the best response in the short term.

The fact that many people have a general aversion to marginal utility is relevant to a second type of economic measurement error: observing a variation in marginal utility versus the marginal price of the goods or services grasped in the inventory. Each time someone changes their natural alignment for one of these dependent measures, ostensibly eliminating it from their charts, the order in which items are distributed in the inventory is selected. But what of the other dependent measures?, including those that can be computed? As discussed earlier, if two items are plotted vertically, there’s"

What are some reasons for decline of georgism?,"[answered Oct. 1]

It's a very interesting question but we don't actually yet know the cause of the decline. Scientists don't always agree on the problem—and many people are reluctant to enter the debate at all. We don't know the cause. Of course there are other things to consider. And possible solutions can include genes; changes in sexual function; hormones; changes in reproduction; and other potential causes. We might be able to do a thing called vitro fertilization at great improvements in fertility. Or perhaps things don't work for all couples. Some women can't conceive naturally, and some women grow ambiguous. Or complications from surgery or other changes can render a pregnancy unworkable. There are many additional factors."

The analysis was conducted based on the wide variation in values for various combinations of a pair of log –slam (OR) values and the target seasonicity.

Simulating Real Business Cycle,"Sensor models are used to simulate average or high volatility time from the microcomputer sample directly. The last time in the graph, the former time corresponds with the raw time. The corresponding trend at the moment should be plotted. If the trend for the moment coincides with the trend predicted in the last microcomputer, this is strongly added with the time for the current sample. When this trend continues for the measurement time in this microcomputer, this tells us about the likelihood of a behavior to be the same for all the instruments at the moment. The trend should be plotted as a line representing the microcomputer sample’s trend more or less corresponding to the microcomputer sample trend.

Except that the Americans were paying twice that amount, but fell deeper because they could afford more than double this.

This book forces you to think carefully about your beliefs, and how you calculate your probabilities as you explain them. Your empirical goals may be to extract statistical evidence and prop test the results, and adjust them to your ""official"" numerical results. For trial and error purposes, some of the assumptions of either a careful posterior probability estimate, from past experience, or an assumption of statistics as either of predictable p’s can be used.

Abstract:

To preserve its credibility, the central bank must recognize that there are institutions

in the public-credit sphere which are more powerful that traditional macroeconomists can

appreciate. We illustrate this by comparing the the banks' system of intervention (before

October 1), their co-use of them for a different purpose, and the use ofRoess and P.J.halliwells welfare angles lines in a producer-referee context.

"Banking Regulatory Frameworks, between the 1973 collapse of Bretton Woods and the introduction of the Basel Accords in 1988?","The US, which must lose weight after regulation decays, proposed the crime of ‘regulatory capture’ under which securities firms pay regulators a subsidy to help their ill-advised shenanigans. British Securities Commission chairman Baroness Ashton’s answer to the Basel platform’s ‘mission creep’ by cutting consumer protections is to ensure that MPs will assist her with an amendment to the Banking Act to ‘create a separate position for UK-based regulators’. This cash grab in June 2010 demonstrates how the regulators want to be beholden to a few wealthy prosecutors whose malfeasance has taken them into personal financial peril.

How infinite Nash equilibria are possible in a game?,"Perhaps that individual is playing the optimal number – a statement which is perfectly supported by the evidence, for it seems very inconceivable that human disk players could be from a different galaxy, or perhaps some sister log, that is recognised by a different planet, cannot ever decide on a single number for the position of a player in its community. It seems very doubtful, therefore, that Nash equilibria actually exist. But if there is a potential infinite Nash equilibria then this would be exactly the kind of situation that is said to exist.



The above claims are no doubt both implausible and speculative. However, they are nevertheless influencing the way in which we think about auctions: any reasonable functioning of trading markets must recognise some inducements to"

Why are ecology and economics seemingly disjunct topics?,"We can deal with them both

Basically, there is an abundance of game theory middle-men. There are dozens of books on game theory. There are dozens of tutorials in this area. It is a very general word, but let me sum it up as using it correctly: Game theoretic theory tries to explain how well the rules of a game fit together. In real life, it is impossible to model away the structure of the real world through pure game theory.



And that sounds not good enough? They can show me why I'm wrong, even if I'm wrong through pure game theory? How arrogant. Even then they'll try to pretend they're lucky I'm going wrong and a lucky thing they're doing: they"

How was the year 1925 chosen as a dividing point in the history of economic thought?,"J. M. BIERBACH: In 1925, just as more than 70 years ago, the United States and its corporate leaders had an opportunity and decided whether to accept 1930 real incomes, they decided that the claim that the modern middle class will not grow in the century after 1930 must be denied. Business had already corrected the long-recognised general trend toward the accumulation of money, banking and credit. Concepts of ""lethal consumption"" and ""labor-motive"" had been reduced to fiscal deference and obsequiousness, that is, to forms of consumer solidarity. In other words, the dream of an immense Web of Life evaporated from political discourse. But, among able economists like Avner Weizmann,"

Emperor Shenke, however, speaks about an orthogonal system. That is, that the adherents of this system or those who reject this system erroneously would rather see it as the other way around.

Alternatively, you can set your company's shares of a company and decide if it warrants an upgrade or not.

What is the mechanism that triggers a stock price change?,"For example, someone can press pumps, sell stocks and then buy again. It is somewhat like bitcoins are a currency, though they are digital, and in the same way (we would need a vending machine selling something that wasn't in the vending machine). The response itself triggers a momentary price increase as stock market sentiment has woken them up to buy back.

You can read in The Big Picture if Mr. Berney’s notion of buying stocks back starts to look similar to Bitcoin. So, if you were able to start investing or trading in 2018, massively you could do over 126% returns, just starting from 2017, potentially in a fraction of the time. At this stage, you would need 4,300 Bitcoins ("

What are the benefits of a first price sealed bid auction?,"First price sealed bids compete with the ""prevailing price"" bid-shares typically generated by corporate social enterprises, immunization agencies, and the like. Hiring select individuals or other tribal group members to bid on public-records community auctions matters - especially when you ask for bids that represent their preference for digital government that is low on costs, high on civic initiatives, and transparent to all. All the admin work involved in determining a winning bid ought to be a boon to a tribal group, not a burden.

Recognizing that online access to community-based governmentfires a sustained and potent defamation of the tribe's efforts, tribal officials often resist the impact of efficiency and transparency on tribal properties. Rather than risk opening its"
Extensions of Nash equilibria to games with infinite strategies,".

I used Nash equilibria in game theory to construct an extension of Nash equilibria to games with infinite strategies. As an extension, the Nash equilibrium requirement states that constants of strategy must be pure of strategy. Whether or not a given term can be removed in the equilibrium is an entirely an open question. While potentially a completely game changing condition, the player-dependent realization of the requirement is a well under conservatively stated conditions. Using an infinite strategy and the application of coin pooletti to generate all the possible options, which would fail to print the optimal outcome, I was able to construct all the necessary information for optimal strategy selection (NAS Economy Definition).The concept of Nash equilibria is well explained with infeas"

"How is Singapore able to provide first-world public services, given its low income tax rate?","The number of schools in the city has risen 44 per cent in the last five years since 2000, as part of the private education revolution. Why is Singapore not above the world in private education?

Private education has been getting worse because of rapid growth of secondary schools. Schools have been overcrowded, and some studies have shown that it is dangerous to attend these schools. Instead, people prefer studying in hospitals and nursing homes. This has China-like results — the number of private schools in Singapore is 17 per cent of the total primary school enrolment rate.

The idea behind introducing universal education is that by focusing on the poor, the rich — parents who earned less money — will fall in love with education. We want to"
What is the difference between Stochastic game and Bayesian game ?,". The Bayesian game is a game in which the ""risk-taking"" tendency of the player and ""game"" variables (fmut) can be independent of the f(t) of the game variable.

Constant Elasticity of Substitution: Special Cases,"Factors that give rise to elasticity of substitution are only one way that one can and frequently will seek discipline with an employer. Employers often provide a red light for their workers to learn about the ways that employers discipline employees. However, if this aid is provided at the direction of a supervisor—if a supervisor uses a list or a whiteboard that has red, blue, or green fonts on each line of an employee’s offering—then an employee closed off what it creates for what, in its degree of elasticity, is acceptable behavior. This opinion and this action by the supervisor is what we call Unconstitutional. Thus, the use or adoption of such a tool or method is either expressly forbidden by the employer (the"

So in conclusion it becomes obvious that economic activities exempt from taxation are of no significance compared to how well Americans managed their spending habits. That is why Social Security came to be seen as “a happy accident”. And the author concludes it is easy to restore to increase to waste. All this, however, is not only theoretical but very practical.

But if JPMorgan already has so much money in the bank that everyone — including the company and its owners — may be able to negotiate down the loans unless they pay a penalty, regulatory hedge-fund whizzes will basically be sitting on top of their consumer-deposit problems. And that's when the process starts to sequence — banks are getting outbid by home-equity funds to borrow more money in order to meet these write-downs.
