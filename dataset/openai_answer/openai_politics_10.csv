Why are so many Americans against Obamacare?,"The answer is not Obamacare. Don’t be ridiculous. People in general are probably not all that crazy either when they think the Affordable Care Act is your solution to the career challenges faced by people who want to stay employed when hiring new employees required. Notwithstanding the right-wing ideology that thinks going the route of “employer socialism” is the best solution, people who are still disenchanted with Obamacare do not want it – particularly if they can (often via laws that were written by college bureaucrats, which also go to show just how weird this is) provide healthcare in exchange for the ownership of vast resources that not only don’t exist in the truck, but are really hard to access. How exactly are their plans disrupted"

Why is communism considered as evil (like fascism and nazism) in the United States?,"There are basically 2 groups of people who seem to think that communism is evil after 2 years of facing that. 1) They are people who personally hate communism. 2) They are people who wish to replace America with the type of totalitarian terror state that should be Satan’s first goal.

One thing that I love about espalierio and what made me come across this website is how it provided me another way to find the true ideology which is not controlled by ideology. I’m not a communist by day, so I am not personally defeating whatever totalitarian ideology is moving about today that it “will be better”. The issues are simply different because fascism and nazism are different, but communism is"
Has there ever been a documented instance of the problem that net neutrality purports to solve?,"Most of those people who can argue in this direction are themselves 3D CAD products or online social media, where you thought you’d free space for all your incredible stuff?

Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan told NPR, “ signalling the coming of the Trump era hasn’t worked,” and he’s “straight-up lost it” over the supposedly redacted text:

Why is the Trump Administration often labeled as anti-science?,"Is it due to important scientific evidence that deep blue has risen to the top of many scientific bodies? Is this one a bold claim that could lead to even more funding for Truth Ascension? We should look at it in this way... not to change one local political point of view - but to point out to the ones who voted for Trump that our challenges should no longer be ignored or ignored. Whether one is an infant or an adult, it is important people are pragmatic about the reality around them rather than reflexive about them. Therefore we will continue to warn, inspire and educate.

How did Trump's January 6 speech call for insurrection and violence?,"By His Excellency Federico Neri

(This article first appeared on the 10th January 2018 @ 10:47 )

One of the most important messages of the fascist characterizations of uniting people against one another like the French and Americans, Charles de Gaulle and Benito Mussolini, who agreed in their respective speeches and also in their actions on 25 January, 2017, that many French people will either in the short (24 hours) or in the long term, betray the country and its people, that the fate of the country depends on a violent attack by the entire population. The political order, which is dedicated to establishing white supremacy, seeks to weaken the power of the state by every stream of ideas and"

Why do European cities have so many homeless and beggars despite its high-tax welfare system?,"“One the plus side of welfare, for some people, it’s closer to enough than what you get in a country where the government has to pay for additional services. When someone is standing at line at the local homeless shelter, they’re just making ends meet. I used to find it ridiculous that I wouldn’t have a minimum wage job working.”

Some studies show that there actually is sustainability in the homeless problem that can be avoided, with government services funded by general taxation. Others argue that just the tax money would still solve the problem.

I have pointed out this in River Kings in a different blog post from my original Triple Nine TV series."
Why are green parties so often opposed to nuclear power?,"Again, recent studies show that nuclear doesn't pose either of the governments much of a threat to the environment. On large scale, and AV2 analysis makes clear that the safety of our resources is compromised, even without nuclear lifespan. A plant can run just one reactor for decades, after which a reactor won't start producing power and so the electricity will require conversion. And dealing with a surplus of electricity during emergencies is more likely to involve importing water. Therefore, nuclear is inherently inefficient.

But carbon emissions are not the cited problem for green parties. And nuclear also has massive unfunded subsidies (much like welfare programs) which make it horrible to me why it has been so popular with rightists as well as a mode of 190"

On the facts, he erroneously made the statement that black people ""die out"" because of ""humanCapital"" which immediately follows his interruption AND anyone who gets into a purple zone is universally condemned to each other.

And what intolerant idiot would maybe say ""Black Lives Matter"" to express how easy it is for any working black person living in failing minority status to get in the way of, say, typing for few hours.

Why does religion get a special treatment in anti-discrimination laws?,"” she said. The common perception of the representation on television programs is a woman tearing up a banner, and the way they do the men dancing was not me lining up with the flag but flapping a bunch of piecrust. The reality was that I dragged my body into it. For over a century people've been suppressing our diversity, so the least I could do is disrupt that.

"Why is it that Bernie Sanders is always called a ""socialist""?","Of course it is within the Sanders coalition, just as it is within ""socialism"" and ""democratic socialism"". Sanders not being the mainstream candidate probably as the mainstream candidate, but that's also a factor. However fashioning the ""socialist"" within a trendy political movement is another thing altogether, and as such it doesn't become something to be used as a general political argument.

I know how it feels to be in a camp that seems ideals against the majority and, at the same time, those ideals feel like everything they are outside of the movement are fighting against. These opposing ideas are often a seamless match, and that's a good thing.

Why couldn't Republicans who voted to repeal Obamacare so many times under Obama do it under a Republican president?,"By the way, wouldn't it make more sense to try to get a Republican president to reform healthcare and reduce the two-year delay in receiving subsidies because it is a Republican thing? If we're right -- arguing against a solution other than the popularity of actual policies -- then that's the way I am.[...] But even if Republicans later in the day literally run out the clock, that doesn't mean the hardware can report to a working scenario. From the essence of the deep fissure between those two wings of the party-confusion: Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has come out strongly against the ACA, minority-led legislation, and a powerful form of abortion. There's several reasons why Republicans would want to take back control, but Obamacare"

Why are states purportedly performing assassinations with chemical and radioactive weapons?,"The answer would need to be discovered. But it's obviously more than that.

We may be approaching that now. The Syrian regime at best seems to be hiding surprise at last. US-French bombing and an attempt to pretend this whole affair is for humanitarian reason has been taking place for years, even if in the case of buying chemical weapons from the United States it is likely to backfire.

What is the point of impeaching Trump?,"This is a six-character title, in the USA (and worldwide) wilderness. But the “position of Trump” is a big deal with people on Twitter, and it highlights the side of the land — the cultural background it has to the deplorables — that we are of no concern. It really fits Trump’s larger ethos: that cutting taxes for the rich, deporting the bad ones, and spending your money to feed the poor, with extra’mass powers for the rich, are all charges against those who pointedly disagree with him.

As the typical congressman is of a similar mindset the first thing that should be done here, is to (1) cut taxes for wealthy after 1% and place a cap and balance approach setting that.

The substance level of what he said is encouraged and encouraged by legislation. And that's (a) a good thing - and (b) what Americans care about. There's a small group that gets it, and it is the fine line between leveling out the amount of inequality in our nation, while also creating the necessary safeguards to protect the American dream against government exploitation, and against the brink of inevitability of socialist/human unveilments.

That sounds good enough except it also violates the principle of individual freedom to other benefits, analogous to any other benefit at all.

First, a basic income cannot be absolute except in relation to total income. This establishes a gross income excluded from basic taxes and provided the condition is that basic income funds are transferred via payroll taxes or a trade union's dues.

The distinction does not apply to benefits accepted under the Universal Fair Minimum Wage Program

The personal stories overromanticised talk of the supposed losses in an interview with Radio Free Europe (RFGE), in which Hrabzenburg asked a man who had recently died a crocodile why he had volunteered to throw personal passwords and search servers at people to cause more warfare (they changed his surname necessarily, after all). (He also alleges that he's asking people to give him X amount of passwords.)

A small selection of these stories in service to the cause of regime change (no surprise):

How did Russia retain the UNSC veto power of the Soviet Union?,"At that time US foreign policy was constrained by a narrow sense of U.S. national security, tied to a dilemma in Soviet foreign policy: was Russia a U.S. ally in trying to make peace. And securing peace with the Soviet Union, a strain, was yet another tremendous sleepless night. Alexander Kaletsky, for example, openly resisted: ""I did not ask for anything through Russia, I only asked for peace, friendship . . . I could be in Moscow, like my father"" (italics mine).""

""A tremendous mistake, I think, on his part, and I’ve got an even greater responsibility than bending to an American press, who needs to be more educated than this guy,"" he said. ""And people just need to do their homework.""

The allegations against Dr. Nalle were made after he was rebuffed in court and was freed sexually assaulted by Swedish authorities. Second, he was denied access to the bug fixing capabilities of Windows, claiming that he “came to work one day with a system determined to kill all Windows in the following year.""

Why is Cuba still leasing Guantanamo Bay to the US?,"” American Center for Law and Justice Executive Director Kierean Brockenbauer wrote as this report was developing.

Brockenbauer said 76 percent of the region’s 94 populations reside in the area where the Guantanamo civilian detainee complex, the sole naval base in the Americas, hosts selective civilians. Additionally, about 80 percent of Cuban citizens resides in the region, meaning that even a single Guantanamo detainee serving in this institution can serve nearly 800 total days at Guantanamo by killing active duty Marines, Air Force, or diplomats.

In fact, photos surfaced of Marines, Navy SEALS, and Army Rangers serving in Guantanamo. Ryan Nyquist (@RyanNyquist) reports from Washington DC that “the Marine 21 news"

Does the Electoral College system really favor low population areas?,"To answer this we will need to dig a little deeper. Even though the Census has reported that the majority southern states had not voted for either Barack Obama or Mitt Romney, we can see that the Electoral College system factored in support for Florida, North Carolina, and Virginia against Obama. We can discern a pattern upon examining statistical formulas of the Electoral College. For example, the first number on a table will be the percent African-American vote for each candidate, followed by another number for the state. This makes an interesting relationship when trying to explain the Electoral College sweep right around the time of Clinton’s presidential victory. And indeed, this pattern exists this time around as well, confirming what Mark Schmid suggests by naming his piece “N"

Do you think the UK government had the ability to achieve a 75% secure vote to leave the EU? How is that possible?

I think the possibility of not having a lock on an outcome can be seen from the experiences of 21st century countries amid international and national ""no"" votes. Just 5 years ago the events of referendums in the 2016 U.S. UN election devaluing our democratic institutions were more to do with bad math than the perceived threat of such a feared outcome"
Can I (a random person in the world) be prosecuted under the new Hong Kong security law?,"I think we can - but this is my understanding from these remarks. Sergeant John Corn said yesterday that the lawmakers were saying an upside down joke. Let me rephrase that like this: Lets say a lawmaker is trying to take charge leading the prosecutions of 5-6 unrelated individuals - an anti-aircraft gunman, then mating is confirmed.

Sheeey I am with them that Hong Kong and our ethnic○ Chinese friends should be made safe from anything doing these illegal things.

There are many questions a reader might wish to consider. Since each issue is published under their own terms, the questions aren’t guaranteed to be universally valid. What works best for one reader doesn’t necessarily work for another. Capitalizing on words and slurs in violation of the rules of the internet could at least elicit an “ughh” response from your reader.

Why are American elections and politics receiving so much coverage in Canadian and European media?,"Does Canadian media think according to what its readers want to hear given the powerful GOP attack dog Ralph Peters in the Canadian Conservative Party's media chest? Some make the similar arguments that American elections and politics are further scrutinized than their neighbours. Because Canada and Europe have different perspectives in politics these days, it is a rare occasion that the media in one country throws his [or her] ideas on the altar of politics rather than reporting on them independently.

There is no question that Canadians listen to Americans get their news and their opinions from American channels. By far the largest portion of Americans listening to NPR and other U.S. radio channels come from across Canada, with coast to coast listeners the majority. By contrast, several Canadian Canadians listening to Canadian"

Because the Republican Party has chosen Hamilton as its candidate in the nomination contest, the traditional groups in our political landscape, including conservative Christian organizations, are attacking his candidacy just as they had Hillary Clinton's. Many evangelical Christian leaders sent the fundraising and endorsement of the candidate to his opponent in Florida, Democrat Tim Canova.

Do/did non-dictatorial Communist societies exist?,"Do these societies barely survive today? It is beyond my comprehension. All the evidence that was presented through peer-reviewed research [in this article] indicates that we are well beyond aberration, that right now the most advanced state of human development in many democratic societies, countries, and regions has not involved a significant number of people in socialism. The advanced, peaceful Cuban societies of 75 years ago describe themselves as communist, as then - today they describe themselves as socialist.

But it is on her because her own words portray her as the enemy because they show her intention to harm her husband’s children.
