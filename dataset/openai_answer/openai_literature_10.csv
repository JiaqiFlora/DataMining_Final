Why was 1984 set in 1984?,"It is simply the product of all its successive historical forecasts, by people like Roy W. Borden, my high school science teacher at Long Branch, New Jersey, who encouraged me to take up balnaciachrach as a hobby when my brother’s role models didn’t fulfill Maslow’s classic five-wave model but “tragically” chose to live in (and outer-spaceally dominate) a nightmare that he felt forced to recall in order to protect the world from Dr. Evil.

Snoopy can balance on an edge atop his doghouse. Is any reason given for this?,"The answer is that, with a slightly different asymmetry, the living (primordial) world could be left in a computer. As mirrored worlds collectively collect information, other identical worlds “pop up” in the same form as the one in which the humans are located. Not only that, a single human-machine live variant is cryptically born in a participatory reciprocal experience and the world of parallel universes is extracted from this environment. Duchamp's rule suggests, for example, that a living and no longer living phenomenon can naturally want or not want for one-another a mutually failing society fluctuating grotesquely between the extremes of enjoyment and distortion.

What is Hobbes?,"- It was a classic political thinker, and a rather infamous thinker. I argued, in The Philosophical Review, that Hobbes (sixteenth century English writer and philosopher) was one of the finest human beings in the world at the time, “a mighty and eloquent character of sense and understanding. He was a hastongener, an earnest, an honest, honestly calculated, shrewde man. In his mistakes he had a habit of being murderous.”

Did Gaiman and Pratchett troll an interviewer who thought they were religious fanatics?,"Writing pretty much like that?” is worthy of note. But just as boycott ideology has spiked in the wake of peripheral events like the Sandy Hook massacre and other tragedies, and more broadly in the wake of the grassroots protests that came to both places in 2007 when frontline leadership is a “brave people”, so too has the ideology permeating the left come to live in the present. Far from always elevating social justice warriors, the often galvanizing ethos of anti-political correctness has already detached itself from its traditional leftist roots criminalizing both morally repugnant and rationalistic sentiments.

Suddenly we were talking about overelad and having no idea that it was actually in a loaf, let alone a cake or a bottle of wine or even inside a machine.

"Did Poe plagiarise someone else's work when writing ""The Raven""?","And if so, why?

AFAIK, ""Origin of the Dog"" is an April Fools' trick which precedes Poe's tragicomic story ""The Raven."" Poe instructions its audience to break into a house when a mouse has peed on the bed. The story is basically a pornographic parody of a prominent political case that involved Stormont being prevented from defying Queen Mary due to his religious beliefs; this is also exactly what Poe refers to in ""Oedipus"": One is a monster from beneath the skin .""

When and why did the Brothers Grimm start collecting fairy tales?,"It is possible that it was a way of recreating the popular narrative that arose on the continent in the middle of the 18th century. In Alpine fairy tales, monsters were people, and in Hansel and Gretel they were mice and birds. It does not, however, mean that Grimm invented the books. The Grimm brothers squeezed together a vast amount of tales from this repertoire of European weaver tales. All are collected in a book dated 1629. This addition was made in order to make his earlier collection appear later, when they had already been in focus for decades before. It can be learned about Grimm’s childhood through the place where he lived. He lived in a manor on the North Hinder River in Switzerland; in"

While Nelson is certainly the only literary figure in modern history who wrote in an idealistic and fairly called-for sense a masterpiece that is both essential to understanding Christian authenticity and reveals Christian God and Christianity’s genius for redemption, he may be mistaken.

Take first, for instance, the dichotomy thesis: that Narnia represents Christianity inherent in all great myths by inverting the previous three contradictory reversal meanings of our cosmos. However, the following examples have several attempts from C. S. Lewis to “mold Narnia into Christian Christian Christianism” (or “masculine Christianity”, according to C.S. Lewis)."

Which flood story was first: Genesis or The Epic of Gilgamesh?,"October 23, 2017

Rather than seeking an easy way to defend the flood story, I wanted to sound the alarm about how that flood story undermines, and may even endanger, the biblical narrative on multiple levels. First, the literal literal appearance of God on four man-made days reminds me of the Ozhma Galbanu in the golden age enchanted unicorn tales, though it has been significantly weakened by innuendo and awkward narration. Instead I wanted to come to terms with the central dynamic of the flood story: salvation does not come to the people of the promised land on biblical soil but may be from elsewhere.

Why are Freud and Lacan still seen as important to literary criticism when their theories are discredited?,"One reason is that they were often criticized for being too “emotional.” HAS is also criticized for not being “realist” in ways that other philosophers have in other meanings. Jacques Lacan’s ideas have no natural or obvious starting points and are never more than reliably contested within the contractual history of morality in general and Freud’s in particular. On account of this, we shouldn’t try to explain the way contemporary treatments express themselves or the filmmaker’s tactics in terms of psychoanalysis. A culture of experience would be needed for capture of that de-realized behaviour.

What is the meaning of the epilogue in Blood Meridian?,"After finishing Blood Meridian, I lamented that it was short, because I wanted more. But since the book is so short, I didn’t want to turn anything on pages. So for the last fifteen pages of Blood Meridian, it builds and walls me up. I need this to tell more.

The epilogue of Blood Meridian deals with a different order of events in a different body of work: Skybound, one of the new works in the Americana which has taken roots in Seattle, as well as its follow-up, Media Buy.

Did Homer base the Iliad and the Odyssey on mythology?,"I suspect it's hard to find the right people on this. At the moment there's no convincing argument that these stories are about real historical eras or even very early historical eras. I don't see anyone saying the Homer was based on Anaxilaus.

My main problem with the whole approach to mythology's early sayings is that it invites bunch of arguments about how ancient mythologies have some kind of relevance to history or to Christianity.

Anyone can point out works that were influenced by something, just as Dream of Gerontion and Homer had many older works influenced by India, Persia, Batanes, and others.

Mythology's got all those kinds of ancient influences right. But I think we should never let one"

This – that– it was one of things that taught them about Jesus. Several of the cousins believed in the lies whose theft and actual theft they took to frighten the brothers and their families.

In an age in which Wilder emphasizes connections with the world attained only through cooperation and collaboration, he suggests that we use art as a vehicle for communicating intuition to others. The poem is jaque restoree at the end of transgress the idea that War is the proper name for the invasion of life by new and more beautiful creatures; War arrives at our minds via other means. War is not to be a metaphor for violence and destruction but for the employment of force and violence for self-protection.

Is it common practice for cover art to be designed without direct input from the author?,"In addition, which of the parties will provide meaningful information to the artist giving the contribution (stock, title, species etc.)?

I hope to use those examples to demonstrate that it's under-utilized, though certainly possible to use such examples to demonstrate missing roles. First of all, it's not always clear as to which role is ""disciplined,"" employing a show- Tavern. A lot of work is driven by constraints, and probably not a good idea to (a) approach Nickelus personally to request design, or (b) have a mental image of the cover before we're done mentally seeing it. I hope to use these sort of examples to help clarify concerns that arise.

In another fine example of Carlson's fisticuffs to women, comedic Royal Kid had waggling pigtails but one consistent feature: his entire ""personality"" was defined by a feral propensity to do stuff to people, consisting of yelling, scratching, pulling people's a-holes, trampling people, kicking, burping, peeing, biting people, provoking youthfulness and so on."

Why is the hero's journey so ubiquitous across world literature?,"I've studied the great masters of world literature -- Geoffrey Chaucer, Henry Fielding, and all the others -- but theories of the hero's journey further back have shown themselves to be derivative. Yet many of them are still very useful. In contrast, the western hero's journey was a revelation. It came from within. Writers have celebrated it as a revelation of spontaneity, almost without limit, unloosing spontaneity. It has long seemed that the pursuit of a moral is an unselfconscious pursuit, which has little to do with reasons, inner motivations, or situational situations. Yet during the so-called process, the writer learns that the hero's moral is so difficult to find?). It is possible for a mechanical action"

How much weight should we give authors' declarations of their intent after the fact?,"(Turk, Strawberry, Vine & Wild, 2008). From the standpoint of the historian, who makes the declarative decisions that salonists take, it seems a most unfortunate decision.

What are the challenges in translating a work of literature?,"”

Zhou is described as someone who combined the attention to accuracy with sincerity and restraint, and a love of detail into a work of fiction that “falls somewhere between Twain and Poe in the facts, details, and symbols.”

Zhou is the first writer in history to have both the authority and the passion of Peccary. This artist and poet had strong colloquial and poetic roots – through conversations with his traveling companions, newspapers, letters and journals, the cultural jargon and turns and turns this obscure local poet created was always rich with fresh and funny ideas.

In Norman Cohn’s classic The Great Sword in the National Museum of Man and Man’s Other Great Invention, Oswald Bacon answers the question:

Never before, before now, did anyone ever pass through the hearts

Of any one of my epistly Romans,

men and women with such unspeakable perfumes

As those whose bare souls find England so warm

As the flames of the stoves in the devils’ mouths; that each

Not only assumes a secret chef, but offers

Branding too, the marketing of his taste,

Who chained the albatross to the mariner's neck?,"What is the significance of inbreeding if it goes against one's will?""

The idea of concerning one's own species with violent prejudice or even utter contempt was common throughout the fifteenth century, and the seventeenth century gave rise to a number of phrases emphasizing the paternoster-like nature of the family relationship, an aspect of scientific belief that reflected a change in the small stature of males in East Europe before the Church's rule. Yet such statements did not precipitate the formation of a distinctly new science of natural history; they mattered much only as a tool and a metaphor for a recent trend—the adoption of the idea of the plenitude of nature; the reverence in Western thought for the protist at the base of the tree"

""Would I have said to him, 'I wanted to make this film on Faye Kellen. Please, I should have given up trying to make this film on Faye Kellen,'"" writes Evelyn said. ""He told me I should try. He wasn't there for me when I could of made it.""

"Does ""The Soul selects her own Society"" by Emily Dickinson have a simile?","For that, see "": In The Watch List"": History has generally been uninitiated as to our duty to seek wisdom from poets, and erudites too wisely, but for worldly things has been learnt in a chased shop-stall."" That simple saying demonstrates continuity yet the first century had an entirely different image as well as notions of their usefulness and practical value.

Why did Bill Watterson choose the character names he did?,"These aren't just normal wethers and they definitely shouldn't be. The reasons are as follows: Character names are powerful symbols. They allow various characters to share a name that reflects their heroic or meliorative qualities. I have never noticed a symbol in a character's name that would be completely unremarkable in most other types of characters. They were designed for one reason and that reason was the symbol they were chosen to represent in a particular environment. This clarifies the continuity of the Stan-Watterson controversy. Also, as noted by one observer, this was only one being to which Stan could not control which characters he chose to submit. The successful writers on this show must always have desirable themes running as major characters. An example of"

The first Rule of Man was by definition not a social nosh, that being an arbitrary empirical maxim which drops completely from the night sky every time that an sardonic teenage boy closes his eyes.

Is there any animal internal monologue in The Lord of the Rings?,"Sometimes you may see an animal visualizing itself, first in speech, then writing itself. There is ‘losing’ – which itself represents loss – someone who has been loved in some form. This is embodied not in all the book – many girlfriends were characters too, although their presence did not make sense for the ‘intro’, which does not know who they are. In Tolkien’s method, the ‘intro’ of the whole text is dramatized: show us the objects we are supposed to relate to, and the natural Hodor of the Lothlorien Manor will display itself in the poems, music, dances, songs and looks that are largely constructed through ‘voice"

Her unrequited love for Ben purposefully destabilizes the living conditions of both birds and people around her, if the conversation could be taken out of the perspective of A Wrinkle in Time.

What does the last sentence in chapter 2 of Crime and Punishment really mean?,"But it says something about lack of knowledge and inaccurate models about human nature that underestimating the tendency of Germans to use violence was a common sentiment among liberals, while believing that the use of violence alone could only be used by non-violent means. Their belief existed in a mindless way, as if every German thought before he received his book, and by reading it with their eyes closed asked their own secret thoughts. Thus, hypocrisy towards the idea that distrusted Muslim Mujahedin might not be enabled by precautionary measures. These were the only interpretations of the statements of the German leaders. This question was totally ignored, as such questions would certainly stunt the growth and non-violent development of national anti-imperialist societies. Examples"

Is Winston Smith in Orwell's 1984 an unreliable narrator?,"This is a fascinating question, and my deepest respect goes to the brilliant and thought-provoking essay by Julian Simon calling Winston Smith into question. Simon exhibits a surprising honesty in his attempt to describe the state of confusion our heroes have avoided.

Sure, there was situations in the novel that felt singly impossible. But the beginning of 'The Great War' was far too tight-knit, and the final chapter converges too fast between carnage and campaign-winning. The writer takes us behind the scenes, past immigration reform, fire brigades and engineered languages across the half-billion Pacific Ocean to track lugubrious children through the streets of Paris and rising world-weariness.

"Why did the author of The Dictionary of the Khazars publish a ""male"" and ""female"" edition, and what's the significance of the textual differences?","Back in decades, Egypt was under Scandinavia's control and the scholars were either historians or scholars of religion. The author Harry Flint, for instance, convened seminars and kept libraries full of dictionaries. He imported all the local Armenian dictionaries (diatoms) and Sanskrit scholarship, so he had a major collection of religious and border volumes. He even prepared a 22 volumes western (west) Asian (core aboriginal) dictionary.The prophet Masihiermon of Egypt was a very good scholar and essayist who may have been the most significant scholar of his time. He collated all the ancient national and regional vernaculars of the country and compiled a substantial collection of grammars and dictionaries, including much older material. equally,"

Why did Montresor want to kill Fortunato?,"”

“That’s simple,” Juan said. “I was not about to give her, the woman of his heart, to ME. Besides, that’s how ‘a whore’ works. She can’t see another. She keeps her eye on JFK. It even became my strategem. The wind of DUMD is, in spite of the covers, puffing toward the explosion. Those big guys are set, and now she’s afraid to break her blind watches. I think perhaps that Suprematang is in too good a position to try something like this. So she won’t risk breaking her watch that way. It’ll be"
Do all old stars get their own private island and a magical buffet table?,"I was blessed by letters for a lifetime! I became more open with a handful of conversations with Mary Beth and the candor of her stories. Over the years, I collected a number of letters that communicate a depth of feeling unique to each of my books: in The Imperfect Garden here, (you’ll know the text too by my father’s initials), Esther theme home, and in this one: A deathbed day “beautiful just like fate.”

"Is the fight between Mercutio and Tybalt a joke, or is it serious?","It's funny, but no joke at all. Yeah, Mercutio's like, gonna handicap Tybald to get fame and fortune, but it's very, very serious.

What is it that makes Tybald that special? It is not just because he has magick in his veins. It is something big, and it is the reason I want to kill all its victims every single day. Also, Tybald has the gall monkeys, and it's because Mercutio knew he was downtrodden, because he's thoughtless, and Richard will never forget how he began to belittle Merret. Metal masks, everyone knows, masks are for the strong, but you're in a Mad World and everyone"
"Is calling Queequeg a ""cannibal"" meant to imply he literally consumed human flesh?","I wasn't aware that cannibalism was a cultural practice at all. Perhaps it should be expressed through a very specific lens.

A proper schoolyard bully would not go for a boy who is more alliterative than tyrannosaur. Not to mention, unless someone is in the gutter, that soy sauce out of the bottom of a glass is only going to taste good."
"How much ""self-editing"" did Nabokov do when his Russian novels were translated into English?","Recommended for ""essen.""

Official summary.

It lacks intensity of imagination.

My main dislike of the book is that it revels in annoyance with its ungrateful tastes. I assume that being a big downer the author refused to eat anything but all, practical foods at all, not even potatoes. Perhaps he considered them to be a bore? Or, losing his vegetarian friends, genetic mutations or, when faced with a healthy dish, warning that he'd heavilyet up his physique. I found the book dull to read and annoyed by the lack of meaning in many of the scenes that are imprinted upon my memory. Possibly Nabokov thought that most Russians, including the book, thought that royal teas and Mother"
How does Room 101 reset for each person who enters?,I've heard that souls need to sit downstairs. That's not how it works that way is it? The soul will wait in the front of the hallway after all.

"Why ""Moon Child""?","; for, in declaring that the moon is god, was used in a positive sense, not as referring to an animal. Of the true nature of only gods, etc, see Rev 9:5, 6:

Justification by Faith - God forthcoming; living without sin; for reason, thus made understand and sensible of sinless righteousness. The presence of a mute god hence a misuse of language; hence the led-out pronunciation of ; and with this statement of the necessity and need of God ceased all those changes of style and substance of works that looked potentially to rob god of his mark.

Why did Morris and Clay preemptively dissolve the Red-Headed League?,"The league was dissolved over concerns that the disagreeing players were running the show in Chicago. Miscellaneous screenshot

Clay was definitely aware of this, and Moss's report that Clay had handed control of the league over to Sid Bream in 1956 was a slow start. The move began on Friday, September 17, 1956, with Clay hiring Sid Bream from the United States Amateur Athletic Union as an executive vice president. But on the same night, Clay sent out his old friend Sid Turvey with a list of top executives for the organization to select. On the list was seven rooting workers.

Was Stevenson's Treasure Island influenced by Poe?,"Of course. In addition to producing a number of novels, and a short story, Stevenson also wrote a tale entitled Jeffrey De Toffola's Respite, which vividly depicted the Hampshire hamlet of Wannop-lore (now privately owned but the estate is currently co-owned by developers), its inhabitants, and the way that it was lost to the pursuing darkness of the Huns. But before we consider that influence, let's turn to what King may have taken to be the terror scene in East of Eden: the horror delusion of resolute nature's matching spirit; an idea that haunted his imagination, which he spent growing up on Y Open Trees.

Did George Orwell ever feel that Spain would be better off under Franco?,"Yes, I believe you have that right. I think the main reason Communism failed was because it took over a person's head. George Orwell and the rest of us felt the same way. You threw George Orwell into a organization that hated him and his books. That's it. Basically you hurt the whole person who read his books. If communism had come in four years earlier you would have started with less than a million people. Saul Alinsky did that. He didn't live to see communism succeed. Hegel didn't live to see Hegel succeed. You know what would happen if you didn't give life that chance? You'd kill off the thinking, you'd give it to Lenin. Germany is closer to freedom than France or Britain or Stalin."
