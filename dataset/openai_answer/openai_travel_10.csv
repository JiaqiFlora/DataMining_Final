I first saw tongs posted on YouTube in 2003 as simple and versatile stand-alone tools. Within days, they had gained a new life: as the item ticked off my 'bucket list' list of things to learn to do with the mybody by looking at the instructions and getting a pair of tongs at a local tech store (and then buying a whole TON of free tongs to keep myself entertained). I've been tethered to my nipples ever since, so it's become a huge annoyance whenever I drop the tongs anywhere in the house.

"What are these large, empty towers made of connected metal girders, bars or pipes in London?","These towers enclose shiny mountains on newspapers' comments—they're like a junk heap. Constructed in a hurry and envy-inducing neatness, their disorderly rubble looks indeed as though it represents the progress of optimism: the towers are a reminder that life isn't just proceeding so smoothly yet so very slowly. Mount the tower, Riverman says, and ""the whole world becomes dramatically splendid."" But that's not the problem. The problem is that the quiet mesmerizing moments of beauty in Versailles are vanishing, vanished not even as soon as the towers are built.

What is a continental breakfast and what other types of breakfasts are there?,"In general, a continental breakfast is a traditional breakfast other cultures have historically received in the UK. The most common variation on continental breakfast is called a sandwich breakfast or classic continental breakfast. An example could be bacon and egg omelette, but it could also be oerloon (lox), calabrian rabbit, or anything else. The most general description of a continental breakfast would be ""sandwich breakfast"" which incorporates the traditional flavors of the continental bread, a northern continental coffee, and sausage/cheese on a toasted steel country bread.

Marinara pasta has often been a continental breakfast replacement for a traditional English breakfast.

Are there other continental countries, such as France, Germany, and Italy,"

Why would a visitor destroy their travel document?,"They are not sure what this is good for. But simple logic. This must be a criminal offense, and the danger is it can cause future flight incidents - with even worse consequences (such as a rikinit threat to someone else). And the very phrase “the joy of leaving home” is a crime.

Generally, if there’s been an incident, the travel department is going to be alerted. Often it is a case where Pakistan has been ruled out - we have been presented with timelines by NSC and it makes sense that they will defer to that decision (until the whole “CNPP consultant” and their colleagues have had a look at their material - they’ll be totally caught"
Should my first trip be to the country which issued my Schengen Visa?,"In order to travel, it’s important to first determine where you can stay. If you travel with family, it’s common to stay with friends and other family members. Instead promote your use of more modern, self-contained accommodations. If you must travel alone, be sure to ask family and friends to allow you to stay with the person you”re traveling with, rather than just renting.

If you’re traveling alone, if you’re in some business from out of town or international you”re agreeing to stay with a hotel or motel. It”s easy enough to direct someone to a place to lend a hand. If you want to spend a lot of time"

It has been my experience that at the paternoster elevators downtown, they are very expensive to use and unpleasant to look at.

Yes, provided you present a private-bank balance sheet that shows all of the bank assets.

"In US museums, why are backpacks only allowed to be carried on one shoulder?","In the US, a backpack generally has a decorative strap at the top of the backpack, and a belt or another item fitting beneath the strap. The backpack always features a security strap as well.

Many people have a backpack that has a belt that is hidden at the bottom of the backpack, and possibly a detachable closed laptop pouch from the belt.

People believe they must actually attach a belt to the backpack near the ""lock and lock"" lock on the shoulders. Were that the case, it would be outrageously rude if people simply bent over backwards not to expose a hard to access shoulder strap. I (and many other racists) will gladly bend over backwards if necessary.

Can I travel to the USA while working remotely for my non-US employer?,"“user optimal working hours” –

This may be true for our US colleagues because some of our projects are considered “more productive” from the office location perspective because they use information from our office for “magical” copywriting tasks such as content marketing.

How do you choose a restaurant when travelling?,"Do you have a specific meal preference on vacation?

How to search for a flight when dates and cities are flexible but non-direct flights must not pass through a particular country?,"After a flight passed through a particular country, we cannot use the other airline’s database, update an existing booking, or retrieve the original flight. Even if the airline provides information again in the future, a similar hotel should just update their published data, i.e. the city of departure and the city for pick up.

What is the normal payment method that can be used for an airline?

PayPal, Venmo, Credits or another similar payment system is sufficient. In general you can use any credit card issued by the airline. The routing of the flight should only be one next to the payment method on the itinerary and we can confirm an airline has chosen that one for us in the agreement."

Luckily, final determination lies with the airline, which may take the time to gather all information to determine if something is prohibited. “If there is an emergency, if they do violate any law, long-term privacy damage could occur,” Lawson said in reference to devices used both by themselves and others.

I have no proof I would have paid it to anyone, or nobody would know that, and therefore they likely won't. What I do know is that they check the form to see if I am raw material seller, but I can't read this so I'm not sure that means one thing is a scam and another thing is another.

"Can I voluntarily exit from the US after a 20 year overstay, or could I be detained at the airport?","The CSPI estimates there are more than 1,000 foreign citizens U.S.-designated as a “systems engineer” in the United States. That number includes subcontractors/controllers, technicians, and other workers that they were assured had not been detained by DHS. Under procedural rules, migrant workers from the United States and their visa-holders are only permitted to work at certain assisted living houses or community-based housing where they are legally allowed to come to work. Since information such as this has circulated widely, we expect that if a worker is detained, others might share that information, and the rules might change. We await official guidance on this issue before acting.

Conversely, a startup is not very good at predicting the future. That said, there are two different market technologies which can make just that prediction a lot more likely.

What makes a market prediction possible? Generally speaking, companies have some large advantages over the general consumer. They have a cash flow which improves. They are more open to new types of customers. Capital may come with a larger debt discount. Companies also have some money to absorb the losses on excess trading credits.

Usually, for buildings with two stories and perhaps an amount of parking, there are always two street addresses. However, blocks of flats have not such opportunities and there is no reason why two street addresses have to be recorded.The number of separate street addresses is quite small.

Why don't airlines have backup planes just in case of an emergency?,"A back-up crew would not be needed during an emergency situation. And even this requirement would need to be up-to-date with FAA's regulations. Though the reason for this is blurry, the ABC Business blog says ""experts who've worked for airlines, including Boeing, have studied the issue and say until the FAA can get the regulations into line with current air rules, planes would be shut down.""

Even if you think it's odd that the official emergency response plan doesn't include a #backup crew. Note: Take this as a hint.

What's the make-up of the backup crew?

Can I travel back to my homeland after being granted German refugee status?,"”

Doing so becomes a crime in Germany. Unfortunately, you won’t be looked down for this – even though 10% of asylum cases end in failure. The majority of asylum seekers are destined to poverty and even destitution in Berlin. People who apply for refugee status must pay surcharges of around €333 (hard translation: $357) a month.

If you dare to look economic refugees in the eyes, they ridicule you. They won’t believe your stories of trying to improve your standard of living in Eritrea. In fact, many refugees are suicidal, and deserters outnumber Hitler-haters 20 to 1.

What are the best ways to avoid data roaming fees when travelling abroad?,"To avoid deals with Data roaming fees when travelling abroad, you can consider these other advantages:

1. By travelling by air, local calls are not cost-shared with a passenger.

2. It is the usage of the aircraft that determines the difference between domestic and overseas lines of service.

3. Of course, some partners offer to provide roaming services.

The fact that data roaming services are no longer done on the basis of a contract to provide roaming service is a matter of fact. That is because of the name “Car Traffic”.

Mobile communication is a huge priority for all airlines nowadays and hence, data roaming fees are not used to get to places that they are prohibited"

"Is ""departure time"" when the plane leaves the gate or when it takes off?","Does not the aircraft accumulate additional fuel? Come what may, all airport officials agreed that ""departure time""--both the point of departure and the arrival--is always ""departure time."" And the exact meaning of the word ""departure time"" has recently been really hotly disputed. But after all, flight departure (windtime) is the same thing as when a flight departs on the ground--at the airport.

More trouble arises when the airline says that four other times per day an insulting smile or a kiss or a five-minute wheelbarrow look takes flight departure, and what are four when it is fiven per day?

What is the longest stretch of the Autobahn that is guaranteed to have no speed limits?,"Actually, car safety standards basically mandate a minimum speed limit of 100 kilometers per hour on the Autobahn. There are no specially designed speed limits, but as a general rule, very heavy vehicles, such as trucks, trucks, buses or even autonomous cars, will never exceed 200 kilometers per hour on the autobahn unless asked to do so. As for a perfect instinctive setup, it would indeed be highly obvious that all such maneuvers would be subjects of safety admonishments, just like a full-speed ahead would be subject of severe fine. And a reminder on this topic is that safety terms also include bitting speed limits imposed on other theoretical models, such as internal combustion engines. But no one seems to be always politely asking an"

Hoffman, a drone pilot, drove down the twisting 22-mile stretch of dirt roads to finish with his fat bank account and his young bride.





“I’ve driven up the hill for the last bit of the way, found another beautiful lot, put out attachments and grateful bright light and headed out again with rose. ‘We’ve got all the way to Canada,’ said the duck.”

Whether it was the surprise attendance of at least Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints teenage members or the fuss he aroused in tourism contractors, Hoffman paid a visit to the local District Clerk office.

How does Expedia manage to sell a room significantly cheaper than the hotel itself?,"To be fair, a cabin cost approximately $850 per night in the lowest category. If you're paying the full room price, that would add $2,100 to $2,200, which obviously isn't the best fee, and probably won't show up in the expense report.



However, if the ""high cost aspect"" is lowered to ""suffix"", then the number of toes is not changed at all. There is no transformation of the number of liner pads, although this would clearly mean a higher cost, since the entire signature goes to meet expenses.



Surely that said, you'll either have to pay a reasonable amount more/even more,- or you wouldn't need to (12"

Why is public transport from/to the airport so expensive?,"A study by Fast Forward Worldwide found the price of the short hop of a car from Changi to Singapore from HK$570 including bus/train fare but cost a ferry for those to the Island. One thing I was surprised about is how little is included in the price tag. Perhaps the car carrier was “giving” us a “great deal,” but the ferry operator was saving us time and money for no which is where the claim to this seems big.

Why don't American traffic signs use pictograms as much as other countries?,"History

The W-gram is originally a part of the Polish language, hence the name. It is however from Japanese, a Offkyanete, which had originally an “eye” (polarized, being in a right-side-up position). It is supposed to have come from “winter” (when the sun is coming up) and Verse inscribed on them:

Can I exit and reenter a UK station while waiting for a connecting train?,"Probably. You'll need a lot of time to be able to wait for your train and re-enter the station after exiting and rejoining a stop, subway, or bus, or at least set up another way to exit and reenter the station.

Can I exit and reenter a bus and stand in the area on the next bus?

There is no place to exit on the next bus. When the next bus leaves you, the next stop you get on the bus is not completely the closest to the bus you were waiting at; it's just within walking distance. So you can sometimes get in front of another bus, if you press the elevator button two or three inches behind another bus and push the red stop"

Are drivers from mainland Europe likely to end up in an accident when driving in the UK?,"This article outlines what you need to know if you’re driving for issue to the Government by driving carelessly, callously or unfairly. Unexpected events such as traffic accidents can lead to significant effects in life or death. Drivers engaging in unacceptable behavior that poses a danger to life or limb must be prevented from driving alongside others who behave in some way that poses a risk to others. However, this impacts on performance on the road (Johannesson and Wilson 2002) and may also cause accidents, delays, casualties and other delays that are preventing people heading towards their transport journeys. We note that in the UK many new carpools are being introduced by implementation of new driving rules. Figure 1A shows the volume of journeys made"

"What's the right answer to ""Check, Savings or Credit"" for an overseas card in Australia?","Australia and New Zealand residents have an international credit card (IAN) with a 'check only' balance option. This option centres out processing for you to the credit card company. Once the balance reaches zero, the bank then charges up to the current credit limit, subject to increase on the flat-rate, catch-up rate and surcharge.

For overseas individuals who do not have a credit card and don't pay interest on it, THEN you can set up a foreign checking account which may cost significantly less than the basic American card to add an account. Once adequately secured this can quickly be run due to their undersized 1990 American credit card.
