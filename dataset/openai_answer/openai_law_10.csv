"What 'specific legal meaning' does the word ""strike"" have?","""The word strike, as used by lawyers, is an extreme form of a legal action. A lawyer will stop a car on a side of the road, which he/she represents as his/her client's alleged desire to hit your car. If you object to this action, the lawyer would essentially be stopping traffic so you can actually block traffic. Action is really the same in this case as trying to hit a vehicle, and an argument by motorists to that effect is not a strike. In brief, since this can result in a loss of your motor vehicle insurance, the man's reaction must be illegal to stop the traffic on the side of the road legally.

Microsoft has this playbook before it that they will likely go out IPSW with functionality that contradicts what their original announced intentions were. In this case, they likely did their best to run this like Windows based on later versions of business standards (and modern hardware). In the Windows side, it felt like everything was in place to see just how wrong it was going to be. In the solution to this I can’t really run into too many cases where I was even once made aware of a mistake. Even in the Model 100 Board case example, I would feel the need to"

The Silent Justice Act has urged police to refresh the on-line records, get old ones that don't have the technology available, etc in order to freshen these up.

Does being engaged (to be married) carry any legal significance?,"Perhaps not. Extramarital sex between living married persons (for both spouses) is legal under many U.S. states. It's not illegal for a man to have an extramarital affair with a woman under certain circumstances. But being engaged to someone is a legal requirement of marital status in tens of thousands of states. Many conductions in this context include living with a proven misrepresented spouse. In fact, the term ''marital status'' has been adopted as part of the United States Code. A 2003 precursor to the federal Marriage Tax Treaty, also intended to regulate the divorce of married couples — failed. Twenty-eight states plus the District of Columbia are still approved for its standardization. Why should marriage rules be changed?"
Why does it matter that a group of January 6 rioters went to Olive Garden for dinner after the riot?,"They probably went home thinking there was nothing to see, I don't know, but the reality is that restaurants and industries traditionally obedient to criticism are almost always firm when they receive a high-traffic period and hard-hitting criticism.

It is true that we had a precedent in this case where one party was incarcerated and the opposing party in the same jail.

But that judge wrote a decision opener that has no bearing on the Harris-Clark decision.

Can a private person deceive a defendant to obtain evidence?,"With your insights, you can help the attorney decide whether or not to intervene.

Such a defense, incidentally, avoids any one-sided pleading argument for more time.

Domestic statutes are based on pre-existing domestic use principles, and so, absent exceptions, are generally only affirmed to the extent that the determinations of a court or statute are satisfied. Not in all countries, since a triviality like property trespass or merely a breach of the contract can never make a socioeconomic-defect-based infringement-illegality-prone.

What are the legal ramifications of a legally dead person turning up alive?,"Legal proceedings can be initiated if the deceased person is indelibly linked to a certain person, property, or legal liability, such as mentioning his or her name, or if the deceased is mentally disabled. If a death has been ruled a suicide or unless someone makes a positive forensics and dental determination, a non-lawyer or doctor will probably be appointed to take the deceased’s personal effects and record it on the death certificate.

On the contrary, if the deceased was in fact a child or a relative of a relevant person, living relatives can either request a court to terminate the deceased’s legal rights of inheritance, including right to probate, and transfer the property to them without the client ever knowing they were being"

Must the interrogation stop when the right to counsel has been invoked?,"3.01 The purpose of a hearing is to obtain the information provided by the police officer. Because the police officer may have the right to protect his identity and confidential information, the police officer should invoke his right to claim information provided by the justice when providing the information. The police officer should invoke his right only after assurance that the information should not be used against him or given to another party. The Court will recognize that in this circumstance there is no requirement for the police officer to invoke his right and that therefore a hearing is appropriate. The Court will also recognize that if the police employee requests that the police officer uncover confidential information, the police officer’s right to claim confidentiality is clear and compelling.

The Government does not have great precedent in our courts. Foreign government law is an anomaly; we have precedent. So you don’t need a warrant to enter somebody’s home once the Government has had a look around. Very little in our Courts has to do with domestic surveillance. Keep this in mind! That doesn’t make any sense. If someone were arrested, charged and prosecuted, the Government would do its equivalent thing.
