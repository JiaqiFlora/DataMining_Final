search - How long does it take a patent application to appear in the USPTO database?,"Under the USPTO rules, a patent application takes longer to appear in the database than it does to be filed for U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. You can begin search activity under either USCIS or the USPTO and see how long your application takes on average. 2 years in total takes a minimum of 76 days.

Does your patent apply to the same file, or multiple files?

If your patent application is filed based on multiple files then there is a difference in what the USPTO actually considers for patentability. See the USPTO DCA PCT Section II.B and, if more than one file, the patentability of all complexes.

What is the layman's definition of 'prior art' in the US and other countries?,"A movie critic may be a foreign journalist, or may be a tabloid journalist or theater actor. No one knows or understands all the corners of the American art market, so we refer to 'prior art' when the term refers specifically to art that was produced before 1950.

Is it easier to find quality movies as a result? If so, is that a factor in your decision?

Yes, it is much easier to find quality movies in the US if there is a direct relationship between scenes that are similar, and scenes that are not comparable at all. This is difficult to see in other countries.

Which genre of movies do you group on a 'big four'?

patentability - Are US software patents enforceable in the UK?,"+3322/88/6992/90/02/OP/EU/N.13/I33

- It is legal to sue over patents in the UK for alleged mis-use before a decision is made on the merits of the appeal.

In the UK, there is no distinction between a patent application and the actual patenting itself. In effect, you are simply re-purposing a design already patented by someone else, with the same law application effect of the patent. Putting your patents into startup condition is not “in the laws of the land”. It is just pretty and silly.

Would software written in a country without software patents constitute prior art in the USA?,"Software patents are generally a third class right, and if they are used and infringed in the USA it could run afoul of a US law which prohibits patentability for laws. In South Africa technology differs. There is a copyright in hardware and each company owns the copyright (although this may not be clear with software patents), and so patents and trademarks in software are reserved to be used for international trade or commerical purposes. Software patents are reserved for commercial and industrial applications.

patentability - Can software be patented after being made public?,"No. It’s the fundamental business needs of programmers. In the case of software, the same requirements as a programmer must be fulfilled — both in the form of robustness, security, reliability and reusability. In the case of ipv lines, it’s an intellectual property formality. In the case of an encryption algorithm or a blockchain, the program is sensitive. A programmer’s tasks aren’t described by rules makers or protocol-gauges. (Some may say that the most secure protocol you can write isn’t the world’s best protocol.) From the software business standpoint, one programmer’s jobs are many and are inherently different on the Internet, perhaps"

Patents are housed in online registries, like so many patents hallways, in order to avoid much paperwork and fees. Since many offices and clinical trials don't have an Internet link, they often delegate the task of entry to the internet. Some states, like New Jersey, mandate independent registration of intellectual property (see below), which can cost various numbers of dollars.
