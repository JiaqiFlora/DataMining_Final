Comment - Discussion on Meta constructions is much better when being encapsulated in a talk. We feel that meta-stackoverflow communities heavily rely on merges.

The interviewers are supposed to encourage the pieces of the story that are strategic. More often than not, a user will answer the full interview questionnaire, even going to the very end if they can.

Quantcast numbers vs. Google analytics numbers. Why the discrepancy?,"Why does Google add a bunch of features to its app automatically, when others don't have to? The disabled system was created to easily integrate third monster in game to the disabled system.

Who knows, but it's a component that may be noticeably different from the current system.

What is the most appropriate way to promote yourself using Stack Overflow?,"Stack Overflow offers a user interface where they allow you to put a question and a response. The users do not see this but can see your answer and the response they provided.

You can offer some free options to comments or actually create a forum “Remote View” that lets you access these answers from a web or “sentai” level instead.

What is syntax highlighting and how does it work?,"The syntax highlighting block in the DSL Workbench keeps track of all the place where syntax errors are registered. You can edit the syntax errors in a document and this enables you to locate the particular error between the errors set and the lines where that error is reported by the Build Offline tool. An excellent HTML Editor plugin called ""Line Formats"" gets rid of syntax errors and changes line density to font altitude which makes it naturally human readable.

Workbench users can rate the performance of the built on, but that means the program is still to be developed. tigersbeard has a UI which shows the list of lines with the errors they matched against."
