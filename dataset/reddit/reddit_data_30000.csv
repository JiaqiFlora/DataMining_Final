On July 1st, a highly unpopular [change to Reddit's API pricing](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/) went into effect. [Most third-party apps have shut down](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23779519/reddit-third-party-app-shut-down-apollo-sync-baconreader-api-protest) and so have many tools relied upon by moderators and [projects for making Reddit more accessible to visually impaired users](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/comments/14ggf8k/the_future_of_transcribers_of_reddit/). 

Beyond the [disastrous AMA](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/09/reddit-ceo-doubles-down-on-attack-on-apollo-developer-in-drama-filled-ama/) by the CEO, Reddit's response has been limited to promises that this change will not affect moderation tools [^((it has)^)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BotDefense/comments/14riw76/botdefense_is_wrapping_up_operations/) and promises of [new and more-accessible first-party moderation tools](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/01/1184258201/reddit-api-accessibility-mods). Promises just like [ones they have made in response to past protests](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/142w159/askhistorians_and_uncertainty_surrounding_the/), but have consistently [failed to fulfill](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/14jm3ut/several_communities_have_surfaced_an_open_letter/jpm9e0q/). 

If you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:

1. [Finding your favorite subreddits on other platforms](https://sub.rehab/) and participating there instead.  
2. Refraining from using the first-party Reddit app, instead sticking to one of the few remaining third-party apps or [patching one of the apps that shut down](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1wHvqQwCYdJrQg4BKlGIVDLksPN0KpOnJWniT6PbZSrI/) if you're using an Android device.  
3. Disabling ads on Reddit with [an ad-blocking extension](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin-ubo) or [a DNS-based ad-blocker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBXTnrD_Zs4).  
4. Cancelling your Reddit Premium subscription.  
5. Sharing the continued news coverage of these events.  
6. Encouraging others to do all the above.

Ain‚Äôt that the truth,"PSA: Make it a habit of **reading the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gamingcirclejerk/about/rules)** of each subreddit you participate in:

**Rule 9: No Offensive Imagery**: *This includes nazi imagery and slurs, for you brave nerds who think ""free speech"" involves private internet forums. If you post fascist iconography trying to ‚Äújerk‚Äù, you will receive a ban. The only exception is when we make fun of gamers and criticize gamers who happen to be fascists. Please remember to spoiler any potentially triggering or offensive content accordingly. This rule now includes repeatedly posting bigotry from the same source (4chan).*

**Rule 7: No Participation in Linked Threads (Brigading)**: *If you are coming here to brigade this sub, you will be banned. Likewise, do not make comments and vote in pages you've found here. Of course, if you're a member of said sub and you were already in the thread before, this doesn't apply to you.*

**Rule 8: Censor Screenshots**: *Keep screenshots of arguments on Reddit to a minimum. Please remember to censor screenshots of all identifying information, i.e usernames* **and** *subreddit names. This applies to screenshots from any social media sites.*

**Rule 11: Keep Posts Relevant (only about Don Cheadle)**: *This is first and foremost a place to make fun of gamers. Just because someone is being a bigot online doesn't mean it belongs here. Let them be pathetic without infecting the sub with their nonsense. Please avoid posting screenshots that show people using capital G gamer slurs.* **If absolutely necessary, please censor posts and the words containing such content.**

**Rule 12: No Fake Posts on Other Subs (Contamination)**: *Do not create fake posts on other subs only to post back here. Also, do not ""lol, you should post this on r / OtherSub"". It's considered interfering with their content and can also lead to brigading.*

*This is a reminder to the readers. The post itself is untouched.*

So,  a while ago, there was a county fair where the winning goat got put up  for auction. The girl found out that meant her beloved pet would be  slaughtered, she got upset, and the guy who *paid the money for the goat* agreed to return it to her, and let the county fair keep the money.

The county fair decided that *this would not do* called the sheriff's department to *kill the fucking goat*. The deputies literally drove 500 miles to kill a pet goat in front of a kid.

To teach her a lesson.

My husband doesn‚Äôt know how to be poor,"This post has been flaired as ‚ÄúVent‚Äù.  As a reminder to commenting users, ‚ÄúVent/Rant‚Äù posts are here to give our subscribers a safe place to vent their frustrations at an uncaring world to a supportive place of people who ‚Äúget it‚Äù.  Vents do not need to be fair.  They do not need to be articulate.  They do not need to be factual.  They just need to be honest.

Unlike most of the content on this subreddit, Vents should not be considered advice threads.  In most cases it is not appropriate to try to give the Submitter advice on their issue.  In no circumstances is it appropriate to tell them ‚Äúwhy they are wrong‚Äù or to criticise them, their decisions, values, or anything else.  If there are aspects of their situation that they are able to directly address themselves, the submitter can always make a new thread with a different flair asking for help once they are ready to tackle the issue.

On July 1st, a highly unpopular [change to Reddit's API pricing](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/) went into effect. [Most third-party apps have shut down](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23779519/reddit-third-party-app-shut-down-apollo-sync-baconreader-api-protest) and so have many tools relied upon by moderators and [projects for making Reddit more accessible to visually impaired users](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/comments/14ggf8k/the_future_of_transcribers_of_reddit/). 

Beyond the [disastrous AMA](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/09/reddit-ceo-doubles-down-on-attack-on-apollo-developer-in-drama-filled-ama/) by the CEO, Reddit's response has been limited to promises that this change will not affect moderation tools [^((it has)^)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BotDefense/comments/14riw76/botdefense_is_wrapping_up_operations/) and promises of [new and more-accessible first-party moderation tools](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/01/1184258201/reddit-api-accessibility-mods). Promises just like [ones they have made in response to past protests](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/142w159/askhistorians_and_uncertainty_surrounding_the/), but have consistently [failed to fulfill](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/14jm3ut/several_communities_have_surfaced_an_open_letter/jpm9e0q/). 

If you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:

1. [Finding your favorite subreddits on other platforms](https://sub.rehab/) and participating there instead.  
2. Refraining from using the first-party Reddit app, instead sticking to one of the few remaining third-party apps or [patching one of the apps that shut down](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1wHvqQwCYdJrQg4BKlGIVDLksPN0KpOnJWniT6PbZSrI/) if you're using an Android device.  
3. Disabling ads on Reddit with [an ad-blocking extension](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin-ubo) or [a DNS-based ad-blocker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBXTnrD_Zs4).  
4. Cancelling your Reddit Premium subscription.  
5. Sharing the continued news coverage of these events.  
6. Encouraging others to do all the above.

Norway says Israel response to Hamas attack disproportionate,"The commenters on this post ‚Äì and across this sub ‚Äì might be shocked to find out that conflicts like Israel-Palestine have been solved before. These solutions involved precarious ceasefires and moving away from ideas of self-defence/revenge. Some of these conflicts even happened in Europe. Quite a few of them, in fact. 

So we could look to history for the nonviolent routes to lasting peace. Or we could just keep giving Israel carte blanche to reduce Gaza to ash. Whichever works.

EDIT: Lots of people are, predictably, refusing to engage with this point with any degree of charity. Is Israel/Palestine wholly isomorphic to Ireland/South Africa/the Balkans/whatever? No, of course not. Are there perhaps some similarities *across these conflicts* that might be relevant to Israel/Palestine? Absolutely.

If you continue to label **all** Palestinians as Jew-hating savages that hate peace you are (a) doing an excellent job of dehumanising a subjugated population and (b) refusing to engage with the notion that extremist positions can change. In conflicts that seemed intractable, such as the ones I've suggested, extremist positions of the sort we see, today, in Israel/Palestine were also present. You won't be able to change everyone's minds, of course, but if you meaningfully engage in peace processes you stand a pretty good chance of making progress. This is what history tells us.

It is somewhat disturbing to see the number of upvoted comments that completely write off Palestinians as being too violent, arguing that because they rejected peace before they will do so forever more unless all Israelis are genocided. This kind of rhetoric further entrenches the conflict ‚Äì as it did in my above examples ‚Äì and serves to dehumanise Palestinians. I'm sure I don't need to outline the dangers of dehumanising an entire population.

Finally, for all those arguing that ceasefires are only ever broken by Hamas/Palestinians and that it is Palestinians who reject all proposed 2 state solutions ‚Äì¬†you have an incredibly uncharitable view of Palestinians and the actual history of this region. Might I remind you that Yitzhak Rabin was murdered by a far right Israeli terrorist after winning the Nobel Prize with Arafat and Peres. I also encourage you to look at the ideology of Kahanism and the views of *sitting Ministers* Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalal Smotrich. There is plenty of hate, and opposition to peace, on both sides of this conflict.

Just like I do not reduce the state of Israel to the likes of Baruch Goldstein, Ben-Gvir, Smotrich, and others, I do not reduce Palestine to most virulently anti-Semitic elements of Hamas/the PIJ. We have imperfect examples of conflicts that moved past outrageous extremist positions; I implore you to see the relevance they have here."
I hand sewed an 18th century gown,"A month ago I had the desire to draft myself some 18th century fully boned stays. I used a historical research book called Patterns of Fashion 5 that describes how people used to draft stays and I used that method to get a silhouette that I wanted.

I sewed channels for boning on a machine and then sewed the rest by hand.

Once I was close to being done I of course wanted a dress to go with it so I decided to take my chances and see if I can finish a full Italian gown by Halloween.

I used a pattern by a company called Scroop Patterns and altered it as I was between sizes and needed to extend the bodice for a longer torso. The fabric is an ikea duvet cover. 

The entire gown is hand sewed! It‚Äôs my first 100% hand sewn project and my second 18c century gown. 

I don‚Äôt know why I do this, but I do find it is a huge stress relief for me."

On July 1st, a highly unpopular [change to Reddit's API pricing](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/) went into effect. [Most third-party apps have shut down](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23779519/reddit-third-party-app-shut-down-apollo-sync-baconreader-api-protest) and so have many tools relied upon by moderators and [projects for making Reddit more accessible to visually impaired users](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/comments/14ggf8k/the_future_of_transcribers_of_reddit/). 

Beyond the [disastrous AMA](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/09/reddit-ceo-doubles-down-on-attack-on-apollo-developer-in-drama-filled-ama/) by the CEO, Reddit's response has been limited to promises that this change will not affect moderation tools [^((it has)^)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BotDefense/comments/14riw76/botdefense_is_wrapping_up_operations/) and promises of [new and more-accessible first-party moderation tools](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/01/1184258201/reddit-api-accessibility-mods). Promises just like [ones they have made in response to past protests](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/142w159/askhistorians_and_uncertainty_surrounding_the/), but have consistently [failed to fulfill](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/14jm3ut/several_communities_have_surfaced_an_open_letter/jpm9e0q/). 

If you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:

1. [Finding your favorite subreddits on other platforms](https://sub.rehab/) and participating there instead.  
2. Refraining from using the first-party Reddit app, instead sticking to one of the few remaining third-party apps or [patching one of the apps that shut down](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1wHvqQwCYdJrQg4BKlGIVDLksPN0KpOnJWniT6PbZSrI/) if you're using an Android device.  
3. Disabling ads on Reddit with [an ad-blocking extension](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin-ubo) or [a DNS-based ad-blocker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBXTnrD_Zs4).  
4. Cancelling your Reddit Premium subscription.  
5. Sharing the continued news coverage of these events.  
6. Encouraging others to do all the above.

It‚Äôs starting to happen again ‚Äî,"As you're all aware, this subreddit has had a major ""troll"" 
problem which has gotten worse (as of recently). Due to this, we 
have created new rules, and modified some of the old ones.

We kindly ask that you please familiarize yourself with the 
rules so that you can avoid breaking them. Breaking mild rules 
will result in a warning, or a temporary ban. Breaking serious 
rules, or breaking a plethora of mild ones may land you a 
permanent ban (depending on the severity). Also, 
grifting/lurking has been a major problem; If we suspect you of 
being a grifter (determined by vetting said user's activity), we 
may ban you without warning.

You may attempt an appeal via ModMail, but please be advised not 
to use rude, harassing, foul, or passive-aggressive language 
towards the moderators, _or_ complain to moderators about why we 
have specific rules in the first place‚Äî You will be ignored, and 
your ban will remain (without even a consideration). 

All rules are made public; ""Lack of knowledge"" or ""ignorance of 
the rules"" cannot or will not be a viable excuse if you end up 
banned for breaking them (This applies to the Subreddit rules, 
and Reddit's ToS). **Again: All rules are made public, and 
Reddit gives you the option to review the rules once more before 
submitting a post, it is your choice if you choose to read them 
or not, but breaking them will not be acceptable.**

With that being said, If you send a mature, neutral message 
regarding questions about a current ban, or a ban appeal 
(without ""not knowing the rules"" as an excuse), we will 
elaborate about why you were banned, or determine/consider if we 
will shorten, lift, keep it, _or_ extended it/make it permanent. 
This all means that appeals are discretionary, and your 
reasoning for wanting an appeal must be practical and valid.

Thank you all so much for taking the time to read this message, 
and please enjoy your day!

Guys: the copypasta doesn't work. It's an urban legend to make you feel proud of getting back at the scammer. Engaging with scammers can make things worse. Inexperienced users trying to collect ransom money can get scammed by the scammers.

Please read the rules of the sub if you want to participate. OP I think you have your answer. If you still have questions feel free to create a new post. Remember: don't take advice in private.

A reminder of the rules in r/scams:

> No personal information (including last names, phone numbers, etc). Be civil to one another (no name calling or insults). Personal army requests or ""scam the scammer""/scambaiting posts are not permitted. No uncensored gore, personal photographs, or NSFL content permitted without being properly redacted. A full list of rules is available on the sidebar of the subreddit. Report recovery scammers or rule-breaking content by using the ""report"" button. Also, consider warning community members of recovery scammers if you see them in the comments. Questions? Send us a modmail."

"ELI5:What is Engine Braking, and why is it prohibited in certain (but not all) areas?","Big trucks have a special brake called a ""Jake Brake"" that uses the engine to help slow down. Instead of burning fuel, it compresses air in the engine and then lets it out quickly. This helps the truck slow down without using the regular brakes. The quick release of air makes a loud noise, which is why some towns don't allow it because it's too noisy for quiet areas."

I See Dead People,"This anime is still one of my favourites.

Premise: Mc is obsessed with zombie waifus. One day his cat dies in an accident. He comes across an old book which has a recipe to create a potion which brings back dead as a zombie. He goes every night in an abandoned house to try to make it so he can bring his cat back to life. There he meets this girl, Rea. They start hanging out at night. He fails to create a working potion. Still, he continues.

Her family and especially her dad is a piece of a shit. She drinks the potion to commit suicide. She thought it would kill her as it was made from poisonous flowers and it wasn't working as a zombie potion either. It doesn't kill her. After her dad finds out that she has been hanging out with a dude at night, he tries to punish her and She accidentally falls off a cliff. She dies and rises up as a walking dead. The potion she drank was actually a working one.

This is a really bittersweet story. It deserves much more love.

The title itself is enough to make me cry.

How do I select in a circle? I wanna give this eye a pupil,"I think you should not have applied the subdivision in the first place.

\-Just take a cube, subdivide it directly 2 times, then go to ""mesh -> Transform -> To Sphere""  
\-Now that you have a low poly sphere, add a subdivision modifier on it with waverer value you want but do not apply it. You can now work with the low poly sphere to give it the shape you want.  
\-I am not a topology expert so my way of handling that was to create the area of the hole with the insert faces tool on the 4 front faces,  
\-Then select the edges of the hole and once again ""mesh -> Transform -> To Sphere"" and then scale it on the axis the normal are facing (X or Y) to flatten it. If you are using the looptool addon you can also use the relax button on the edges of the hole to do that part.  
\-Then simply extrude it onward. You can then give that the shape that you want by playing  with the vertices and with the Mean Crease available in the item side menu.

Good luck !

edit : removing ambiguity in some part of the explanations.

edit 2 : Sadly, the blender subdivision will not give you a perfect sphere, if this is what you are aiming for, there is 2 ways that I know of to achieve this goal.  Firstly, if you have already followed this method, you can try and add a  Cast Modifier with shape set to sphere, that should correct the slight  imperfection.

Another cleaner way to handle that is to not start from a blender cube but instead use a custom shape with perfectly spaced vertices. For that you can activate the ""Add Mesh : Extra Objects"" addon in ""Edit -> Preference -> Addons"" and add a ""rounded cube"" with a radius of more than one.

8. Folklore - bonus: the lakes 
9. Evermore - bonus: right where you left me, time to go 
10. Midnights - 3am Edition 


I would suggest listening to the Taylor‚Äôs Versions. They‚Äôre essentially identical to the original versions just recorded within the last couple of years so she can own those versions outright. The TVs are going to be the most comprehensive editions (mostly anyway there‚Äôs a few one offs) with all the bonus tracks from the original albums plus the new vault tracks. 

Some people will say that there‚Äôs something missing from the Taylor‚Äôs Versions, but those are people who know those songs inside and out. For someone who isn‚Äôt familiar with their catalog you won‚Äôt miss anything.

Gamer moment.,"PSA: Make it a habit of **reading the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gamingcirclejerk/about/rules)** of each subreddit you participate in:

**Rule 9: No Offensive Imagery**: *This includes nazi imagery and slurs, for you brave nerds who think ""free speech"" involves private internet forums. If you post fascist iconography trying to ‚Äújerk‚Äù, you will receive a ban. The only exception is when we make fun of gamers and criticize gamers who happen to be fascists. Please remember to spoiler any potentially triggering or offensive content accordingly. This rule now includes repeatedly posting bigotry from the same source (4chan).*

**Rule 7: No Participation in Linked Threads (Brigading)**: *If you are coming here to brigade this sub, you will be banned. Likewise, do not make comments and vote in pages you've found here. Of course, if you're a member of said sub and you were already in the thread before, this doesn't apply to you.*

**Rule 8: Censor Screenshots**: *Keep screenshots of arguments on Reddit to a minimum. Please remember to censor screenshots of all identifying information, i.e usernames* **and** *subreddit names. This applies to screenshots from any social media sites.*

**Rule 11: Keep Posts Relevant (only about Don Cheadle)**: *This is first and foremost a place to make fun of gamers. Just because someone is being a bigot online doesn't mean it belongs here. Let them be pathetic without infecting the sub with their nonsense. Please avoid posting screenshots that show people using capital G gamer slurs.* **If absolutely necessary, please censor posts and the words containing such content.**

**Rule 12: No Fake Posts on Other Subs (Contamination)**: *Do not create fake posts on other subs only to post back here. Also, do not ""lol, you should post this on r / OtherSub"". It's considered interfering with their content and can also lead to brigading.*

*This is a reminder to the readers. The post itself is untouched.*

"YSK brainstorming is best done separately, not in a group","In large part this is because most brainstorms are facilitated poorly. It's not just getting fifteen people in the room and shooting the shit, but many brainstorms end up that way. (Of course, yes: part of properly conducting a brainstorm is that people have put some thought into the topic ahead of time.)

Brainstorms are also not just about coming up with the final idea; they're about allowing input from everyone in an open process so they understand how the final consensus is formed and no one person is the central architect."

"As baby boomers retire, German businesses turn to robots","The following submission statement was provided by /u/donutloop:

---

Submission Statement 

With Germany grappling with a severe labour shortage, companies are increasingly veering towards automation to sustain operations. A prime example is the machine parts producer, S&D Blech, which has decided to replace the head of its grinding unit, set to retire, with a robot. This move comes in the wake of a nationwide skilled labour drought exacerbated by the retirement wave of the post-war ""baby boom"" generation. As of June, about 1.7 million job vacancies linger unfulfilled, with over half of the companies finding it tough to recruit, costing the nation nearly ‚Ç¨100 billion ($109 billion) annually in potential growth, as per the German Chambers of Commerce and Industry (DIHK). 

S&D Blech's transition to automation over the years underscores a growing trend among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Germany, driven by the escalating need to offset the declining workforce and to maintain a competitive edge. The German Federal Employment Agency forecasts a shrinkage of 7 million workers by 2035, further pressuring companies to adapt. 

The automation wave isn‚Äôt confined to Germany; it‚Äôs a global narrative, as expounded by Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP, who acknowledges the game-changing nature of advancements in robotics and AI on the global work landscape. Germany, already a robust market for robots thanks to substantial investments by its automotive and industrial sectors, continues to witness an uptick in robot adoption among its Mittelstand companies. The International Federation of Robotics noted a significant installation of around 26,000 units in Germany last year, indicating a sustained momentum in automation adoption post the pandemic-induced slowdown.

The narrative extends to various sectors, with companies like ROLEC investing in robots to ensure uninterrupted night-time production. The ease of operating modern robots, now equipped with intuitive Human Machine Interfaces, coupled with a shifting perception among employees and trade unions, who now view robots as allies against labour shortages, are further fuelling this transition. 

Moreover, prominent manufacturers like Daimler Truck are leveraging robotics to alleviate physical strain on workers, although they acknowledge the irreplaceable flexibility of human labor in complex production scenarios. 

This shift towards automation, while a pragmatic response to the ongoing labour crisis, also reflects a broader global trend as companies across the spectrum reconfigure their operations to stay ahead in a rapidly evolving industrial landscape.

Your uncle has been *personally* tasked to ensure your death.  You find yourself at a colony, one allied with the Empire; they even have some nobles present.  You know that they're probably going to turn you in for the honor, but... you're so tired.  You can't run anymore.  The colonists come to you, and... accept you with open arms.  They fight for you, even against people they know, maybe even loved.  They *bleed* for you.  You can barely even comprehend what's going on, or why they would do this.  When the commander comes up to you, body shot full of lead and laser, you try to muster some dignity, to give a formal greeting to a superior officer.  That idea falls apart when he puts a hand on your head, ruffles your hair, and says, ""You're okay, kid.  We got you.""  That's the moment that the tears of a lifetime of suffering finally find release."

The Galileo Project seeking security cam footage in New England from October 20,"


The following submission statement was provided by /u/mnemorex:

---

From the Galileo Project ""The GP is investigating an event in New England on Friday Oct 20, between 7:30 - 8 PM EDT. Do you have an outdoor security camera with audio that was running in this window? If so, we would be grateful to receive your footage.""

No additional details here on the nature of the ""event"" of interest, but the post seems relevant to UFOs, given the topic of research for [the Galileo Project](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/galileo). Curious to see what comes of this crowdsourcing effort.

My guy has a terminal cancer diagnosis and he always seems to get better while I'm away and sicker when I'm home.,"He has a mass in his spleen that triggers sporadic internal bleeding. He was given 3 days to 2 weeks to live and is going on 2 weeks. It's a lot of ups and downs. Seems like every time I get a couple days with him he goes down hill fast and then I go to work and he recovers almost entirely.

The vet says stress is what's most likely to trigger his bleed. I'm scared that he senses how worried I am about him which causes him to stress which spirals into me getting even more stressed. It's been awesome since he's given me some solid healthy rebound days to do everything I took for granted with him. 

Not knowing how healthy he's going to be when I wake up or open the door or hell, just even look down at my feet has been a real roller coaster. The hardest thing I've ever done. He's not in any real physical pain, just gets really weak. This entire time his eyes have always been bright. He's always been alert. Not at all how I thought it would go down.

Mainly just wondering if I actually am triggering him to go downhill while im around or if im just self conscious. I really hate that he seems to be allergic to me. I want to constantly be there for him but I feel like he just keeps getting worse while im around. Either that or the malamute mix is practicing some secret blood magic while im not home to heal him. Either is just as likely."

IMO, you complete all the stages of grief for Gravity Falls once you accept there will never be a season 3/it would not go well and ruin many aspects of the show."

"Wyoming failed to invest in renewable energy and primarily stayed with coal. Now with coal prices skyrocketing, a planned rate hike of 29% angers residents.",There are two major wind turbine farms projected to go up in Southern WY.  There is a solar panel farm being discussed where the power is not exported out of state. There are already existing large wind farms. The problem is all of that wind energy is being exported out of state.   The narrative being used by politicians is to point the finger at renewable energy when the state has a TON of wind and solar to exploit. Great opportunity for the state to turn to renewables to reduce cost for residents.

What if Hitler had surrendered and been exiled to an island to live out the rest of his life?,"I think he would be the number one target for assasination by Mossad agents. They killed and tried to kill Nazis of much lower rank, and would thus be unlikely to avert their focus on taking out the number one Nazi.  I would imagine he would need much tighter security than what was seen with Napoleon. Probably a permanent armed forces detachment, naval forces surrounding the island, etc. Even this may not work. The Mossad used letter bombs, for instance. His continued existence would also be a major point of contention with the Soviet government, who would probably use their secret service to do something similar to what was done with Trotsky. I doubt he would resurface like Napoleon did, though. Many sources say his physical and mental state was deteriorating from syphillis, etc. He would look quite pathetic on that island when compared to his earlier life as a dictator-conquerer. Not someone who would be able to inspire people to proclaim him their leader"

Great whites are open-ocean predators used to living in massive home ranges and migrating vast distances. Even the largest man-made tank would not give them nearly enough space. A few attempts have been made to keep great whites in captivity, but they almost always refuse to eat and constantly bump their tank walls, either dying or being released after a few days (AFAIK, the record is 137 days).

Yes, there are other species of shark that are regularly successfully kept in captivity, but these almost always tend to be reef species used to living nearer to the bottom and in more cramped conditions."

On July 1st, a highly unpopular [change to Reddit's API pricing](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/) went into effect. [Most third-party apps have shut down](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23779519/reddit-third-party-app-shut-down-apollo-sync-baconreader-api-protest) and so have many tools relied upon by moderators and [projects for making Reddit more accessible to visually impaired users](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/comments/14ggf8k/the_future_of_transcribers_of_reddit/). 

Beyond the [disastrous AMA](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/09/reddit-ceo-doubles-down-on-attack-on-apollo-developer-in-drama-filled-ama/) by the CEO, Reddit's response has been limited to promises that this change will not affect moderation tools [^((it has)^)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BotDefense/comments/14riw76/botdefense_is_wrapping_up_operations/) and promises of [new and more-accessible first-party moderation tools](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/01/1184258201/reddit-api-accessibility-mods). Promises just like [ones they have made in response to past protests](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/142w159/askhistorians_and_uncertainty_surrounding_the/), but have consistently [failed to fulfill](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/14jm3ut/several_communities_have_surfaced_an_open_letter/jpm9e0q/). 

If you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:

1. [Finding your favorite subreddits on other platforms](https://sub.rehab/) and participating there instead.  
2. Refraining from using the first-party Reddit app, instead sticking to one of the few remaining third-party apps or [patching one of the apps that shut down](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1wHvqQwCYdJrQg4BKlGIVDLksPN0KpOnJWniT6PbZSrI/) if you're using an Android device.  
3. Disabling ads on Reddit with [an ad-blocking extension](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin-ubo) or [a DNS-based ad-blocker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBXTnrD_Zs4).  
4. Cancelling your Reddit Premium subscription.  
5. Sharing the continued news coverage of these events.  
6. Encouraging others to do all the above.

Why racks are a bad idea (vent). Heisenberg pictured in the photo.,"Racks are and will always be a crappy way to house snakes. Unfortunately, buying a 4x2x2 for every single snake that some breeders have would take up way too much space, not to mention money. I do not agree with racks, but as such i Don‚Äôt see them ever disappearing. Breeders take good care of their snakes *for the most part* and they don‚Äôt interact much with the snakes, so temperament really is not something they‚Äôre worried about. And again although i don‚Äôt like racks, i gotta give breeders credit when i see a beautiful new morph, whether that‚Äôs piebald, or blue eyed leuci‚Äôs, or axanthic."

It‚Äôs the original (and superior) ""Battle for the Cowl."" The final showdown between Bruce Wayne and Jean-Paul Valley for the Mantle of the Bat. One of my all-time favorite Batman issues. A fitting climax to the epic Knightfall saga. Bruce uses his compassion, not violence, to defeat Jean-Paul and reclaim the Mantle. Showing why Bruce is the true Dark Knight. 

The symbolism of both Bruce and Jean-Paul emerging into the light together via the hole into the Batcave Bruce fell down as a boy is sheer perfection. This was a true turning point in Batman history, and Bruce Wayne's characterization, for the next several years. This single issue, which represents the culmination of two years of storytelling, sums up who Batman is at his core. And perhaps more importantly, who he is not."

What‚Äôs something you bought that made you buy less things?,"It might sound counterintuitive, because it is usually associated with over consumption. But transparent organizing bins and pots for my food (kitchen cabinets / fridge). I was always terrible managing food, so to be able to SEE what I have made me reduce my waste A LOT. I also have glass jars to store grains and other dry foods, which allows me to buy in bulk. In general, everything that makes me more organized helps with buying less. 

Also, clothes that are REALLY good. Instead of buying something every couple of months, I buy clothes (like 2 pieces) once a year, and only if I really need it for some reason. They are usually much more expensive, but I‚Äôve been spending a lot less on clothes. Same for high quality shoes. My gym clothes are expensive AF, but even using them everyday sometimes twice a day, I don‚Äôt remember the last time I bought new ones. They are good enough to last. 

On the clothes, anything that allows your clothes to sun dry. They last much longer. 

Good pots and pans and other utensils (ones that can last a generation) for cooking have reduced a lot take outs. 

A good water bottle that keeps the water cool for hours. One for coffee as well, so I make my coffee at home and take it with me. 

A stainless steel razor. I don‚Äôt shave that often, but when I do is never rusted / soggy. I have it for 5 years and I didn‚Äôt even go through a box of razors."

Dr. Carbonation Fanart Repost b/c the recap was skipped + SUGGESTIONS FOR REDDIT IN COMMENTS:,I know lots of artists who stay up late for reddit recap segments just for it to be skipped or for their post to die in the algorithm. It absolutely breaks my heart to see people put in hours of work on a post to the reddit just for it to die to a Spoontrioc shitpost or the recap being skipped. I think the reddit could use a flair for high effort or time consuming posts that could be checked every so often outside of the top weekly posts. In my opinion artists or video creators shouldn't have to try to time their posts on the reddit and gamble on guessing whether there will be a reddit recap that week every time they post.

‚ÄòThis Sh*t is Not a Game!‚Äô Jake Tapper TORCHES MTG for ‚ÄòPretending to Care‚Äô About Anti-Semitism While Ignoring Trump‚Äôs Dinner With Holocaust Denier,"From article:

Jake Tapper went off on Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) ‚Äî accusing her of hypocrisy by filing a motion to censure Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) for anti-Semitism while ignoring former President Donald Trump‚Äôs dinner with a Holocaust denier.  
  
In a scorching commentary to close out CNN‚Äôs State of the Union Sunday, Tapper accused Greene of selective outrage as it pertains to anti-Semitism.  
  
‚ÄúThe degree to which some folks only pretend to care about anti-Semitism when they can weaponize, it never ceases to amaze,‚Äù Tapper said, referring to Greene.  
  
The CNN anchor noted that some Democrats have also condemned Tlaib‚Äôs rhetoric on Israel. But Greene, in Tapper‚Äôs view, is hurling stones from a glass house on this subject ‚Äî given her silence on Trump‚Äôs November 2022 dinner with Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes, among other things.  
  
‚ÄúThe leading Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump ‚Äî he dined with Holocaust deniers,‚Äù Tapper said. ‚ÄúDonald Trump posted a screed accusing liberal Jews of ‚Äòvoting to destroy America and Israel‚Äô last Rosh Hashanah to nary a peep from any House Republican leaders.‚Äù  
  
Tapper also added that Greene herself has ties to Fuentes ‚Äî having spoken at an event organized by Fuentes in 2022.  
  
‚ÄúThis is the same Marjorie Taylor Greene who has pushed the great replacement theory in videos,‚Äù Tapper said. ‚ÄúThe deranged notion that rich Jews are trying to replace White Americans and Westerners with Blacks and brown Muslims. Not to mention, of course, her Jewish space laser conspiracy that a consortium including, yes, wealthy Jews, were using lasers on satellites to start forest fires here in Israel.‚Äù  
  
In the final moments of his Sunday broadcast live from Israel, Tapper brought his monologue to a powerful close.  
  
‚ÄúAnti-Semitism is not a cudgel to be used against people for political points,‚Äù Tapper said. ‚ÄúNor is Islamophobia or racism, or anti-gay behavior or misogyny or any other kind of bigotry.‚Äù  
  
He added, ‚ÄúThis shit is not a game.‚Äù"

Venator command bridge tiles off color,"This is a result of the realities inherent to pigmentation. You notice it more with ""off"" colors due to the complexity of off colors when pigmenting.

To simplify for laymen:

ABS plastic is developed in a specific shade, a sort of ""yellowish clear"". Pure colors are colors that add to that inherent shade. Off colors try to change that inherent shade. As a general guide for LEGO, your pure colors are your yellows, greens, greys, oranges, and whites. Off colors are your reds, purples, blues, blacks, pinks, browns etc

Because pigmentation in plastics is done by adding deliberate impurities (in the form of the pigment) the color you get is a direct result of both the quantity of pigment particles, the density of those particles, and the individual chemical properties of the unique particles in that particular batch.

1 and 2 are considerably more controllable now than they were in the past due to CNC improvements (note again for laymen: CNC means ""computer numeric control"", it just means automated, in contrast to manual. inkjet printers are technically a kind of CNC machine, for example) that continue to improve over time. This ties in to six sigma. Historical katana were made using a similar philosophy due to how garbage the limited steel Japan had access to was. Because medieval Japanese steel was both rare and full of impurities, Katana were folded a shitload of times to try and distribute these impurities evenly so they didn't form individual weak points in the material. With certain pigments in injection molding however, they react chemically with the plastic in a way that actually makes that tactic impossible, which is why you get [gold plastic syndrome](https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Gold_Plastic_Syndrome), and why 2008-2016 red and brown LEGO bricks were infamous for breaking easily. LEGO switched to newer pigments to at least fix that issue.

3, however, is where you get this issue and why this issue is inherent to all pigmented goods. You can see it yourself if you get a bunch of pairs of blue denim pants from the same company. They won't be the same exact shade, no matter how close they may end up being. This is because you're basically running up against the realities of physics, trying to take inert materials and alter how they affect and are affected by light. As a result there will ALWAYS be color variation inherent to production. Megbloks infamously had their ""Swirly"" design as a result of this fact. They were unable to control for color so they said ""fuck it, we'll just make it all uneven so no one can tell!"". LEGO meanwhile has spent billions of dollars trying to get the pigments as consistent as they can...and this is the best that's able to be done.

The reason this is so evident in LEGO is because they produce so much. LEGO produces 70 billion bricks per year. That means, assuming each plant is producing equally, each factory produces 10 billion bricks per year. Your LEGO knock offs and competitors will be lucky to produce 10 billion bricks across their entire production line. 

As a result you're 7 times more likely to see, in a 1:1 comparison, the inherent color variation in LEGO bricks vs competitors. This is simply the result of A) physics and B) LEGO producing so much. 

[For another good example of how LEGO's massive production results in weird quirks to the laymen's eye, see here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legostarwars/comments/zl4wk0/deleted_by_user/j04i8pm/)"

Getting comfortable!,"/r/curledfeetsies is back, but please keep in mind the reason it went private was to protest the unreasonable approach Reddit took in announcing API pricing changes that effectively killed numerous 3rd party applications. This action in turn made it harder for moderators to take care of subreddits in their care. Our protest was prolonged by Reddit's actions during and following the protest, which I think can best be illustrated by the erratic, contradictory & unreasonable actions they took against the moderation team of /r/mildlyinteresting. You can read more about that [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/14gjb8x/what_happened_to_rmildlyinteresting/) and also see the stickied comment in that thread [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/14gjb8x/what_happened_to_rmildlyinteresting/jp5w6qe/) for even more context. This type of behavior was also visited upon moderators of other subreddits and while /r/curledfeetsies was not among them, we stand by the impacted subreddits and call on Reddit Admins to listen to the feedback received and change course. We believe all of this has been a net loss for the entire Reddit community and is motivated solely by profits instead of what's in the best interest for the community and its users.

If you post fascist iconography trying to ‚Äújerk‚Äù, you will receive a ban. The only exception is when we make fun of gamers and criticize gamers who happen to be fascists. Please remember to spoiler any potentially triggering or offensive content accordingly. This rule now includes repeatedly posting bigotry from the same source (4chan).*

Of course, if you're a member of said sub and you were already in the thread before, this doesn't apply to you.*

**Rule 8: Censor Screenshots**: *Keep screenshots of arguments on Reddit to a minimum. Please remember to censor screenshots of all identifying information, i.e usernames* **and** *subreddit names. This applies to screenshots from any social media sites.*

**Rule 11: Keep Posts Relevant (only about Don Cheadle)**: *This is first and foremost a place to make fun of gamers. Just because someone is being a bigot online doesn't mean it belongs here. Let them be pathetic without infecting the sub with their nonsense. Please avoid posting screenshots that show people using capital G gamer slurs.* **If absolutely necessary, please censor posts and the words containing such content.**

**Rule 12: No Fake Posts on Other Subs (Contamination)**: *Do not create fake posts on other subs only to post back here. Also, do not ""lol, you should post this on r / OtherSub"". It's considered interfering with their content and can also lead to brigading.*

My redditless friend is wondering what this is,"Rust and Cross Drilled Rotors.

I'd be willing to bet those indentations you see on the pad edge line up with the pattern of the holes on the rotors.

When rotors get wet, they rust, sometimes very quickly.  Having tiny bits of rust inside the holes that grows out will cause more wear to the pads in those places, and over time you get this patterning on the pads.

That or  you have some very strange factory defect on those pads."
McMansion Polygamy Edition,"$1M, 19 bedrooms, 13 bathrooms, 11,235 sq ft ($89 per sq ft)

This single-family residence is located in the FLDS community of Hildale UT right on the border of Arizona. There is a dual-state community where FLDS members can move between states in Hildale, UT or Colorado City, AZ, for legal reasons. Polygamy is still practiced with one-legal marriage, and all other marriages not being recognized by the state. Thus, the other wives can claim single-mother with children for tax benefits.

In the past, many homes of similar sizes were often left unfinished, usually with no siding to avoid paying property taxes as the house was ""unfinished."" I'm not sure if that has changed. Many other homes look similar in this community like giant private cheap hotels.

IMO, there may be no other house in the country this cheap for the number of bedrooms/bathrooms/sqft unless it's condemned."

ACNH was not, and was never intended to be, a live service game with non stop updates.

Dreamlight Valley on the other hand, is intended to be a live service game, which means that as a business they‚Äôve always needed to evaluate what the best method is for bringing in money to cover the cost of development, future updates, and of course make a profit."

What's the most heartwarming story in the Buffyverse? I think it's Anne,"The first time we meet Anne in Buffy Season 2 ""Lie to Me"" she's going by the name Chanterelle & she's part of a cult that worships vampires. A few months later Buffy runs into her again in Season 3 ""Anne"", she's now going by the name Lily. It's revealed that she's had many names before this with other cults.

At the end of the episode she adopts the name  Anne from Buffy & is looking to make a fresh start. In Angel Season 2 ""Blood Money"" Anne returns & is now successfully running a charity shelter for at-risk teens. The final time we see her is at the end of the Buffyverse, Angel ""Not Fade Away"".

Her charity is still going strong. Gunn is feeling the weight of the upcoming fight. He gets philosophical with Anne & questions if what she's doing even matters. She completely brushes off the question. Anne is undeterred & focused on helping others the best way she can.

I know she's only in a handful of episodes but the amount of character growth is remarkable. Going from someone so lost to where we leave her at the end of the Buffyverse. It's such a lovely character arc."

"Did your opinion of Greg change after this episode like steven, Why or why not?","I actually think it made sense that Greg‚Äôs parents turned out to the be the opposite of who he is, because ever since the beginning of the series he‚Äôs shown that he‚Äôs not a conventional person. I mean he‚Äôs literally living in a van, dated/married/loved an alien and had a child with her, raised said half alien child all in his own for the first years of his life and doesn‚Äôt even use the money given to him by Marty to buy normal items. Sure he‚Äôs made a lot of mistakes concerning Steven, but people have to remember Steven isn‚Äôt an ordinary child and Greg didn‚Äôt know anything about the gem race other than what Rose and the other Crystal Gems told him, and even then they‚Äôre left in the dark about some matters because they didn‚Äôt know how Steven was going to turn out. Some people also say that Greg abandoned Steven when he gave him to the Crystal Gems, but once again you have to remember Greg thought that if anyone could help Steven control his gem side it was them. Plus, it‚Äôs not like he wasn‚Äôt apart of Steven‚Äôs life anymore, he‚Äôs always there when Steven calls for him or is in need of some normalcy. I think one of the sweetest moments of the show was when Steven went to him with Buddy‚Äôs diary and asked if they could go find the paladin. I mean any sane person would have said no to traveling across to world to find something that might not even exist, but Greg supported his son and saw how much this meant to him. Greg may not be the perfect parent but he‚Äôs trying his best and does love his son."

They‚Äôre likely making much more than 65K, whether single or with a partner. 

They may have been saving for years. 

They may have been living with roommates or with partners, parents, or in a cheap apartment for years, and/or living in a lower COL area, able to keep their living costs low to save further for a house. 

They may have had help with the down payment, whether it be assistance programs, loans that require no down payment or a minimum amount, financial help from parents, or something else."

First Detection of Heavy Element From a Kilonova,"Link to a [short HD video](https://youtube.com/shorts/LljipJ9cO1M) and the [original press release](https://webbtelescope.org/contents/news-releases/2023/news-2023-134)

When two neutron stars, or a neutron star and a black hole collide and merge, they also expel a few percent of their mass. This matter is very special because it is very rich in neutrons and starts immediately to form very heavy elements.

In 2023, NASA's James Webb Space Telescope showed a clear detection of a heavy element called tellurium. This makes the first direct detection of a heavy element from a kilonova.

Lane splitting should be legal across the U.S,"Lane splitting has always been legal in New Zealand. I understand the main reason was for air cooling bikes that couldn‚Äôt stand still in queues like cars.

As a car driver I also appreciate that for every 20 bikes that lane-split past me on the highway to work, is 20 less vehicles in the length of the queue in peak traffic. 

To me, this all makes sense and I support lane splitting!!"

How in the world did the Fury's have shit performance against people who aren't pro boxers,"Tommy is skilled but lazy because he has always been gifted opportunities in life thanks to his last name so he isn't as good as someone with his experience and talent should be. Tommy is one of those people that had potential once upon a time but he didn't work hard and develop his talent so now he is simply average. (Which is still a big challenge for people like JJ and jake who have only been boxing for a short amount of time.)

Tyson doesn't have the same passion for boxing as he once had, he just mostly cares about money which is fair enough since he has already achieved pretty much everything he wanted to in boxing. He saw this is an easy fight that he didn't have to fully prepare for and could just use as a way to stay active, collect easy money and prepare for the usyk (similar to what he did with chisora). He wasn't expecting a tough fight so he didn't prepare for a tough fight and francis caught him off guard. Francis trained hard, took it seriously and came prepared."

Thoughts?,"As I said on the post about this a couple days ago, if they wanted to do the Dumbledore and Grindelwald story, they should have just done that, not making it a part of the Fantastic Beasts one. That should have just been for Newt and his creatures.

Besides, I remember back when they first announced Fantastic Beasts people were more confused about why they had chosen that to spin off. Most people weren't familiar with Newt. But they knew Dumbledore, and I have no doubt that if they had started with a young Dumbledore film the series would have been a lot more successful than it was.

Include Newt as a student of his and then do a Fantastic Beasts film after that if he was popular enough. But starting with him, and then trying to do a weird hook turn into the Grindelwald story was just a baffling decision."
‚ÄúNo One Should Be a Billionaire‚Äù: Bernie Sanders Explains Why Having Billionaires in Society Is Economically and Morally Wrong,"Hear hear, fuck the rich!


Too much wealth for any individual will create toxic, sub-human garbage. Corporations and specifically Wallstreet, are what enable these type of scenarios by cheating people into a system of betrayal, so only the ultra rich/greedy can benefit.

Once wealth is evenly distributed, we can focus on politics and change the system so everyone benefits and live free, happy and comfortable. 

As long as the majority of wealth is held by the 1%, all life will suffer on this planet and the rich will too, eventually."

Presenting one of the ugliest flags I've ever seen: the Houthis of Yemen,"This post was reported as not being relevant to flags, since this is a poster or sign, not a flag. It's true that flags are not the primary use of this design, and that presenting it as ""the flag of the Houthis"", as English wikipedia did for many years, is not the most informative way of doing things. On the other hand, this design is occaisionally used in a flag form, which makes it on topic for the sub. 

In general, it's probably good to avoid trying to categorise designs as falling neatly into groups like flags, posters, etc. There are very few flag designs that are used only in flag form."

> The search operation was carried out by a team of Polish and Ukrainian archaeologists, aided by anthropologists from the Polish Genetic Database of Victims of Totalitarianism at the Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin, western Poland, according to Dworczyk.
> 
> Poland's state-run Institute of National Remembrance, the Polish Scouting Association, and volunteers from Poland's Freedom and Democracy Foundation also helped in the effort, he said.

> Around 100,000 ethnic Poles were murdered by Ukrainian nationalists in the 1940s, according to some estimates.
> 
> On July 11, 1943, the day of the worst bloodshed, Ukrainian nationalists attacked 100 villages largely inhabited by Poles in what was then Nazi-occupied eastern Poland and is now western Ukraine.
> 
> The massacres were part of an operation carried out by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), whose plan was to have a sovereign and nationally homogenous Ukraine after the war, according to Polish officials.
> 
> The Volhynia region, which was within Poland's borders prior to World War II, was first occupied by the Soviets in 1939, and then by the Nazi Germans in 1941.

Willy Wonka,"Speaking from memory of the book, not the movies since i can‚Äôt remember either as well:

While Augustus Gloop put himself in harm‚Äôs way and disregarded warnings by Wonka, the chocolate river should have had more security, such as a barrier or railing to prevent accidental falls. 

Violet was wholly in the wrong. Wonka made multiple efforts to prevent her eating the gum, declaring it wasn‚Äôt ready for consumption. In fact, her snatching it and eating it despite his protests could be classed as petty theft. 

Veruca is another case of being completely in the wrong. She trespasses in a room Wonka didn‚Äôt grant her permission to enter, in order to claim a squirrel that isn‚Äôt hers. Wonka would not be liable as far as my knowledge of the law goes. 

Mike is a similar case to Augustus. His accident is due to his own disregard for safety regulations and Wonka‚Äôs advice, but the television-chocolate machine lacks proper safeguards to prevent such an incident."

Please remember to read our sidebar rules regarding spoilers as well! If the comment you are replying to is spoiler tagged, **please spoiler tag your comment as well**

##Please utilize the spoiler tag topic brackets

#Due to the increasingly rampant spoilers regarding recent story and character updates, the mod team no longer has the luxury to review your account and warn you for first time / polite offenses. Untagged spoilers will instead warrant a 3 day ban WITHOUT WARNING. üí•"
On a post about a woman being beaten while carrying a man's child.,"As you're all aware, this subreddit has had a major ""troll"" 
problem which has gotten worse (as of recently). Due to this, we 
have created new rules, and modified some of the old ones.

We kindly ask that you please familiarize yourself with the 
rules so that you can avoid breaking them. Breaking mild rules 
will result in a warning, or a temporary ban. Breaking serious 
rules, or breaking a plethora of mild ones may land you a 
permanent ban (depending on the severity). Also, 
grifting/lurking has been a major problem; If we suspect you of 
being a grifter (determined by vetting said user's activity), we 
may ban you without warning.

You may attempt an appeal via ModMail, but please be advised not 
to use rude, harassing, foul, or passive-aggressive language 
towards the moderators, _or_ complain to moderators about why we 
have specific rules in the first place‚Äî You will be ignored, and 
your ban will remain (without even a consideration). 

All rules are made public; ""Lack of knowledge"" or ""ignorance of 
the rules"" cannot or will not be a viable excuse if you end up 
banned for breaking them (This applies to the Subreddit rules, 
and Reddit's ToS). **Again: All rules are made public, and 
Reddit gives you the option to review the rules once more before 
submitting a post, it is your choice if you choose to read them 
or not, but breaking them will not be acceptable.**

With that being said, If you send a mature, neutral message 
regarding questions about a current ban, or a ban appeal 
(without ""not knowing the rules"" as an excuse), we will 
elaborate about why you were banned, or determine/consider if we 
will shorten, lift, keep it, _or_ extended it/make it permanent. 
This all means that appeals are discretionary, and your 
reasoning for wanting an appeal must be practical and valid.

Thank you all so much for taking the time to read this message, 
and please enjoy your day!

&#x200B;

**ZEA Cornelia**

Once, there was an idol who inspired.

Alongside hers, my bubbles of dreams would float.

And should they pop, they burst in a myriad of colors.

&#x200B;

**Hana Macchia**

If our souls were a beverage, then their flavors

are scattered across this world. Yet hers remain

the most distinct. Complex, utterly beloved.

&#x200B;

**Taka Radjiman**

You, my dearest friend, with whom I shared

laughters and fears. Your heart and arms

were more open than any door has ever been.

&#x200B;

**Amicia Michella**

Her, the beloved presence of my evenings.

Thunderstorms became gentle ripples.

Darkest nights became warm, welcoming embrace.

&#x200B;

**Riksa Dhirendra**

In this scary seas, I'd ask you to take brave

plunges with me. Should we sink like rocks, I know

that we'll collide - going down in a fit of laughters.

&#x200B;

**Miyu Ottavia**

Sweet otter, her even sweeter chirps.

She breaks surface and swims gracefully.

Ever swift, ever strong. Ever leading on.

&#x200B;

**Rai Galilei**

Oh, officer, where has your curiousity lead you?

In you I saw not duty, but a man.

In me you saw not beast, but a friend.

&#x200B;

**Azura Cecillia**

Beautiful and out of this world - everything

about her. But tell me, then, how did something

so alien felt so lovingly close to home?

&#x200B;

**Layla Alstroemeria**

Portal after portal she crafts. I do wonder

if she knows. The one that leads back

to her is one I look forward to most.

&#x200B;

**Nara Haramaung**

The princess. The inspiration. The songstress.

The embraker. The fighter. The neighbor.

My sister

&#x200B;

**Siska Leontyne**

Run wild and free in the meadows of your

own choosing. For whatever a lioness

does, all are left in her dust - awestruck.

&#x200B;

**Bonnivier Pranaja**

Cast your line far into the waters, big man.

Whatever bites. However daunting and merciless.

You will pull it all through.

&#x200B;

**Etna Crimson**

To be a hero is to have bravery. And to

accept our hearts, its sincerety, scars, and all.

It is surely the biggest courage there is.

&#x200B;

**Derem Kado**

Namesakes carry prayers and meaning to them.

For you are a gift, something that you've

been trying to cast; magic itself.

&#x200B;

**Nagisa Arcinia**

Like a fruit, she doesn't fall far from her tree.

Hers is simply the strongest, sweetest, there is.

Roots firmed in place, sunlight aplenty.

&#x200B;

**Reza Avaluna**

Singer-songwriter. Beloved brother.

Rhymes and rhythms at your beckon.

Yet your love was your greatest instrument.

&#x200B;

**Xia Ekavira**

How would one forget you, mixtures of melody readied?

Your laughter bounces across my walls.

Pierces the skin, and nestles into hearts.

&#x200B;

**Mika Melatika**

You come dancing, undead spectres following.

But I know a heart beats within you.

I know it rings loud, golden, and true.

&#x200B;

**Hyona Elatiora**

There isn't anything grand to say about this last one.

I went through storms and torrents to be here.

Pained, grief-stricken, hungry, and thirsty.

Yet, I find myself happy. And content.

Somehow.

Now, all those thunders are far away.

The rains have ceased.

And we have been blessed with another beautiful day.

But they are not here to see it.

This place. This pocket in time.

It has all been like a dream.

And though perhaps only temporarily...

... my dreams were turned into reality.

And thus it has reached its conclusion.

I'll go to sleep.

I'll dream again.

And I won't look back.

As for what will become of me.

And if these moments, these lessons.

These memories I've preserved...

... whether they've been worthwhile for everyone, or not

I don't know the answer, honestly.

But, eh.

That's alright.

I won't dwell in these unanswered questions.

After all.

There is only on truth I'll carry with me.

(See [rule 4](https://www.crossstitchsubfaq.com/rules-psas/rules-etiquette) ). Here are the ways you could cite your source:

* A link to the pattern, shop, or designer. Do not link to Pinterest or Google due to the high rate of copyrighted patterns being shared on these platforms. Stating you saw it/got it there is all we need.

* The title and maker of the kit.

* If you designed it yourself, what technique did you use? Program name or paper and pencil? (Stating that you were the designer is sufficient to satisfy this sourcing requirement.)

Redditors act like she an endangered species :v,"The thing I'd get sick of is the automatic assumption you want to see what's in their underwear. That sounds annoying.  
  
Also, to be fair, a girl is a rare thing in these guys' lives."
Venator command bridge tiles off color,"This is a result of the realities inherent to pigmentation. You notice it more with ""off"" colors due to the complexity of off colors when pigmenting.

To simplify for laymen:

ABS plastic is developed in a specific shade, a sort of ""yellowish clear"". Pure colors are colors that add to that inherent shade. Off colors try to change that inherent shade. As a general guide for LEGO, your pure colors are your yellows, greens, greys, oranges, and whites. Off colors are your reds, purples, blues, blacks, pinks, browns etc

Because pigmentation in plastics is done by adding deliberate impurities (in the form of the pigment) the color you get is a direct result of both the quantity of pigment particles, the density of those particles, and the individual chemical properties of the unique particles in that particular batch.

1 and 2 are considerably more controllable now than they were in the past due to CNC improvements (note again for laymen: CNC means ""computer numeric control"", it just means automated, in contrast to manual. inkjet printers are technically a kind of CNC machine, for example) that continue to improve over time. This ties in to six sigma. Historical katana were made using a similar philosophy due to how garbage the limited steel Japan had access to was. Because medieval Japanese steel was both rare and full of impurities, Katana were folded a shitload of times to try and distribute these impurities evenly so they didn't form individual weak points in the material. With certain pigments in injection molding however, they react chemically with the plastic in a way that actually makes that tactic impossible, which is why you get [gold plastic syndrome](https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Gold_Plastic_Syndrome), and why 2008-2016 red and brown LEGO bricks were infamous for breaking easily. LEGO switched to newer pigments to at least fix that issue.

3, however, is where you get this issue and why this issue is inherent to all pigmented goods. You can see it yourself if you get a bunch of pairs of blue denim pants from the same company. They won't be the same exact shade, no matter how close they may end up being. This is because you're basically running up against the realities of physics, trying to take inert materials and alter how they affect and are affected by light. As a result there will ALWAYS be color variation inherent to production. Megbloks infamously had their ""Swirly"" design as a result of this fact. They were unable to control for color so they said ""fuck it, we'll just make it all uneven so no one can tell!"". LEGO meanwhile has spent billions of dollars trying to get the pigments as consistent as they can...and this is the best that's able to be done.

The reason this is so evident in LEGO is because they produce so much. LEGO produces 70 billion bricks per year. That means, assuming each plant is producing equally, each factory produces 10 billion bricks per year. Your LEGO knock offs and competitors will be lucky to produce 10 billion bricks across their entire production line. 

As a result you're 7 times more likely to see, in a 1:1 comparison, the inherent color variation in LEGO bricks vs competitors. This is simply the result of A) physics and B) LEGO producing so much. 

[For another good example of how LEGO's massive production results in weird quirks to the laymen's eye, see here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legostarwars/comments/zl4wk0/deleted_by_user/j04i8pm/)"

On July 1st, a highly unpopular [change to Reddit's API pricing](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/) went into effect. [Most third-party apps have shut down](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23779519/reddit-third-party-app-shut-down-apollo-sync-baconreader-api-protest) and so have many tools relied upon by moderators and [projects for making Reddit more accessible to visually impaired users](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/comments/14ggf8k/the_future_of_transcribers_of_reddit/). 

Beyond the [disastrous AMA](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/09/reddit-ceo-doubles-down-on-attack-on-apollo-developer-in-drama-filled-ama/) by the CEO, Reddit's response has been limited to promises that this change will not affect moderation tools [^((it has)^)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BotDefense/comments/14riw76/botdefense_is_wrapping_up_operations/) and promises of [new and more-accessible first-party moderation tools](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/01/1184258201/reddit-api-accessibility-mods). Promises just like [ones they have made in response to past protests](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/142w159/askhistorians_and_uncertainty_surrounding_the/), but have consistently [failed to fulfill](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/14jm3ut/several_communities_have_surfaced_an_open_letter/jpm9e0q/).

2. Refraining from using the first-party Reddit app, instead sticking to one of the few remaining third-party apps or [patching one of the apps that shut down](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1wHvqQwCYdJrQg4BKlGIVDLksPN0KpOnJWniT6PbZSrI/) if you're using an Android device.  
3. Disabling ads on Reddit with [an ad-blocking extension](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin-ubo) or [a DNS-based ad-blocker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBXTnrD_Zs4).  
4. Cancelling your Reddit Premium subscription.  
5. Sharing the continued news coverage of these events.  
6. Encouraging others to do all the above.

Anyone have continuing PTSD from living paycheck to paycheck?,"It never leaves. And it's so many things that I know intellectually are variants of Catastrophism, but intellect doesn't always get to be in command.

I still hold my breath when I turn the key. Is this going to be when my car dies?

A close relative of the previous...*I don't belong here*, and everyone is going to find this out. Part of me wants to flaunt where I came from, have pride. But a larger part knows I won't be accepted in my new world if they knew I came from nothing. And be sent back for puttin' on airs. Or even worse, sneered at.

And all three of these examples add up to no savings or salary being enough--being terrified of the rainy day forever looming. The roof falling in, a medical emergency, an expensive car repair. Anything. And since 'it' could be anything imaginable, well, the savings required to ride out the storm in one's own magination is never, ever enough. Because no matter what, the sense of panic and fear will always be there. Always."

Say something bad about this show.,"Bane was pretty forgetful in that series. I suppose it's due to the fact he was very recent character when the show aired and reportedly Bruce Timm and the creative team didn't really like the character they were forced to include him by the higher-ups. 

Robin not knowing Barbara was Batgirl while supposedly dating her was pretty stupid. It made him feel like an idiot."

Poll: 62% of Ukrainians favor postponing elections until after war

62% of Ukrainians believe that elections should only be held after the war is over, according to a poll published by the International Republican Institute (IRP) on Oct. 24.  
  
According to the results of the survey, only 22% of respondents prefer to see elections take place as early as March 2024, 6% would like to see elections take place as early as September 2024, and 3% in March 2025, if the war is still ongoing at those times.  
  
A vast majority of respondents believe that Ukrainian diaspora communities should participate in Ukrainian elections, with 70% of respondents believing it is ""very important"" or ""somewhat important"" that Ukrainians outside the country vote in any upcoming elections, as opposed to 28% of respondents believing that the issue is ""somewhat not important"" or ""not important at all.""  
  
Under Ukraine's Constitution, elections are prohibited while the country is in a state of martial law.  
  
In addition to questions posed about upcoming elections, respondents were also asked about Ukrainians' support for being included in NATO.  
  
79% of Ukrainians would vote in a referendum to join NATO, if one was held, with 5% intending to vote against joining the bloc of nations. The results highlight a 20 percentage point increase since April 2022, when 59% of respondents supported Ukraine joining NATO.  
  
When asked about respondents' support for Ukrainian government officials, President Zelensky topped the list of support with 82% of respondents indicating they ""approve"" of the work the President is doing, down slightly from 89% in February 2023.  
  
Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba scored second on the list with 71% of respondents approving his performance, followed by Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of the National Security and Defense Council, with 59% of respondents approving of his performance.  
  
A random sample of 2,000 Ukrainians respondents was conducted September 9-12 through computer-assisted telephone interviews. The results are deemed accurate within 2.2 percentage points 19 times out of 20."

OP has offered the following explanation for why they think they might be the asshole:

 > 1) After my younger son got in trouble for being homophobic at school, I told them about their great uncle, who was caught as gay at the age of 13 in the 1950s, because he died just 2 years later, they didn't know much about him besides that he existed. I taught them about how he was hurt and degraded by our family, including their grandpa/my father, who is 92 and has dementia

2) My older sister is saying that they are too young to know, and that I shouldn't have told them, and at the very least, waited until our father/their grandfather had passed away to tell them

Peta why is he a nazi?," 

Peta's  ass hair here, 14/88 or 1488 is considered a hate symbol. 14 stands for  ""14 words"", a reference to a slogan coined by David Lane, a neo-nazi.  88 stands for ""h\*il hitl\*r"" (excuse the censorship but i don't trust  reddit's community guidelines), since ""h"" is the 8th letter in the  alphabet (so hh).

The person  writing the top tweet refers to Kennedy Jr's tweet and assumes that the  numbers given in the post are a hidden reference to Kennedy Jr being a  nazi.

Remember evil hates other evil just as much as it hates good. Pissing off the king is one thing, and he may be willing to settle it with words. Coming back to yourselves in the middle of the dark lord's castle with something of importance to him in your backpack makes you an enemy for life. He isn't going to forgive or forget.

Conversely, how far into the middle of the feywild, shadowfell, or hell can you travel in an hour.

Did they specify that the hour needed to be all at once? Plague them with increasingly bad luck. Random disadvantage on rolls when it is critical, a word spoken out of turn.

What's your worst tinder date?,"I am 40M and was was dating dating a lot at the time and this was by far the weirdest one. This happened back in the Spring 2022

The match started normal enough though she was a bit young for me at 28.  Her pictures were nice. She said she was still in school and working in investing and finance. She asked to get drinks after only a handful of messages,  which I thought was odd but why not.

When I show up I am immediately taken back by what she is wearing. She is decked out in very fancy men's clothes like someone going to a cocktail party with old money British people.  I later find out the tie she is wearing costs a few hundred from a boutique London store. But this is NYC and a lot of people are eccentric and I think maybe this is just a look she is trying out.

I could roll with the outfit but when I heard her voice I was floored. She started by saying ""Well, Hello there"" in kind of an old timey accent. She spoke like she was SNL' s Kate McKinnon doing an impression of someone.  Now I am thinking to myself ""wtf is this?""

I am polite so I go along with it like this is normal. We starting talking about work and she starts telling me that she just got off work at her job at the 'Running Shoe Store', I was confused because I thought she did finance  but she explains that she is trying to get a job doing that and right now she is working at the running store.  She mentions how everyone there thinks she is a manager because of the way she dresses. In my head, ""she wears the fancy clothes to a job at the running store, wtf""

I casually ask if she likes running and she responds that she absolutely hates running. She also hates sneakers and they don't fit on her feet. She only wears a particular type of mens dress shoes.

At this point I think I am being punked. I start looking around trying to find where the camera is. I can't believe that this could possible be real.

Then she mentions that I am a little young for her. I ask her what she means because I am a lot older than her. She then tells me that her last bf was 78 and the one before that was 85. She is looking for younger guys now because she wants to have a long term relationship and then in a Groucho Marx  voice says ""If you know what I mean"" .

I am now looking at the other people at the bar trying to figure out if they are actors but they all seem normal.

It goes on for a bit longer with some other weirdness.  At this point it was just a car accident and I can't stop watching. I wouldn't be surprised if there was Youtube channel out there with this."

Another Hard Drive W,"PSA: Make it a habit of **reading the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gamingcirclejerk/about/rules)** of each subreddit you participate in:

**Rule 9: No Offensive Imagery**: *This includes nazi imagery and slurs, for you brave nerds who think ""free speech"" involves private internet forums. If you post fascist iconography trying to ‚Äújerk‚Äù, you will receive a ban. The only exception is when we make fun of gamers and criticize gamers who happen to be fascists. Please remember to spoiler any potentially triggering or offensive content accordingly. This rule now includes repeatedly posting bigotry from the same source (4chan).*

**Rule 7: No Participation in Linked Threads (Brigading)**: *If you are coming here to brigade this sub, you will be banned. Likewise, do not make comments and vote in pages you've found here. Of course, if you're a member of said sub and you were already in the thread before, this doesn't apply to you.*

**Rule 8: Censor Screenshots**: *Keep screenshots of arguments on Reddit to a minimum. Please remember to censor screenshots of all identifying information, i.e usernames* **and** *subreddit names. This applies to screenshots from any social media sites.*

**Rule 11: Keep Posts Relevant (only about Don Cheadle)**: *This is first and foremost a place to make fun of gamers. Just because someone is being a bigot online doesn't mean it belongs here. Let them be pathetic without infecting the sub with their nonsense. Please avoid posting screenshots that show people using capital G gamer slurs.* **If absolutely necessary, please censor posts and the words containing such content.**

**Rule 12: No Fake Posts on Other Subs (Contamination)**: *Do not create fake posts on other subs only to post back here. Also, do not ""lol, you should post this on r / OtherSub"". It's considered interfering with their content and can also lead to brigading.*

*This is a reminder to the readers. The post itself is untouched.*

-Dr. Strangelove: It's my favorite Kubrick movie. And it's pretty goofy as well and I really like Peter Sellers' acting. 


-The Thing (1982): It's one of the best examples of how good practical effects can be and it's a classic horror/Halloween movie for me."

Seriously?...,"As you're all aware, this subreddit has had a major ""troll"" 
problem which has gotten worse (as of recently). Due to this, we 
have created new rules, and modified some of the old ones.

We kindly ask that you please familiarize yourself with the 
rules so that you can avoid breaking them. Breaking mild rules 
will result in a warning, or a temporary ban. Breaking serious 
rules, or breaking a plethora of mild ones may land you a 
permanent ban (depending on the severity). Also, 
grifting/lurking has been a major problem; If we suspect you of 
being a grifter (determined by vetting said user's activity), we 
may ban you without warning.

You may attempt an appeal via ModMail, but please be advised not 
to use rude, harassing, foul, or passive-aggressive language 
towards the moderators, _or_ complain to moderators about why we 
have specific rules in the first place‚Äî You will be ignored, and 
your ban will remain (without even a consideration). 

All rules are made public; ""Lack of knowledge"" or ""ignorance of 
the rules"" cannot or will not be a viable excuse if you end up 
banned for breaking them (This applies to the Subreddit rules, 
and Reddit's ToS). **Again: All rules are made public, and 
Reddit gives you the option to review the rules once more before 
submitting a post, it is your choice if you choose to read them 
or not, but breaking them will not be acceptable.**

With that being said, If you send a mature, neutral message 
regarding questions about a current ban, or a ban appeal 
(without ""not knowing the rules"" as an excuse), we will 
elaborate about why you were banned, or determine/consider if we 
will shorten, lift, keep it, _or_ extended it/make it permanent. 
This all means that appeals are discretionary, and your 
reasoning for wanting an appeal must be practical and valid.

Thank you all so much for taking the time to read this message, 
and please enjoy your day!

That's the entire point of FMLA.  If it was based on permission from the employer, no employer would ever give it.  It's federal law meaning you don't have to ask permission, you just have to get a doctor's sign off.  The employer has to comply and can't retaliate or they risk a lawsuit.  That's why it's a good idea to talk to a lawyer for an hour or so to clear up all the details.

[Ukraine] [Palestine] on abstaining,"This was a clever piece of manipulation. Get someone to propose a resolution calling for ceasefire that conflates Palestine & HAmas, know that it will be amended, then use the initial vote on the un-amended resolution as propaganda against your enemy knowing that no-one will look at the results of the amended resolution that you end up voting against.

Edit: another write up

https://x.com/BadBalticTakes/status/1718295319593509339?s=20

""Left: How the UN General Assembly voted for a humanitarian truce in Gaza. 

This is the final vote being spun to claim abstaining countries - like the Baltics and Ukraine, for example - didn‚Äôt support a humanitarian truce.

Right: How the UN General Assembly voted on the exact same resolution - yet with the added statement that the UN General Assembly ‚Äúunequivocally rejects and condemns the terrorist attacks by Hamas that took place in Israel starting on the 7th of October 2023 and the taking of hostages, demands the safety, well-being and humane treatment of the hostages in compliance with international law, and calls for their immediate and unconditional release"".

That amendment got a majority of global votes, but didn‚Äôt pass to a final vote because it needed a two thirds majority. 

It was blocked by a minority of countries that wanted to remove condemnation of hamas and specifically didn‚Äôt like the term ‚Äúhostages‚Äù (rather than ‚Äúcaptives‚Äù) because it recognises them as a criminal group.

As a result of this geopolitical gameplaying at the expense of Palestinians, the final vote was polarising in the way it could legitimise a terrorist organisation holding hostages.

This is why countries chose to abstain on the final vote"""

On July 1st, a highly unpopular [change to Reddit's API pricing](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/) went into effect. [Most third-party apps have shut down](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23779519/reddit-third-party-app-shut-down-apollo-sync-baconreader-api-protest) and so have many tools relied upon by moderators and [projects for making Reddit more accessible to visually impaired users](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/comments/14ggf8k/the_future_of_transcribers_of_reddit/). 

Beyond the [disastrous AMA](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/09/reddit-ceo-doubles-down-on-attack-on-apollo-developer-in-drama-filled-ama/) by the CEO, Reddit's response has been limited to promises that this change will not affect moderation tools [^((it has)^)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BotDefense/comments/14riw76/botdefense_is_wrapping_up_operations/) and promises of [new and more-accessible first-party moderation tools](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/01/1184258201/reddit-api-accessibility-mods). Promises just like [ones they have made in response to past protests](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/142w159/askhistorians_and_uncertainty_surrounding_the/), but have consistently [failed to fulfill](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/14jm3ut/several_communities_have_surfaced_an_open_letter/jpm9e0q/). 

If you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:

1. [Finding your favorite subreddits on other platforms](https://sub.rehab/) and participating there instead.  
2. Refraining from using the first-party Reddit app, instead sticking to one of the few remaining third-party apps or [patching one of the apps that shut down](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1wHvqQwCYdJrQg4BKlGIVDLksPN0KpOnJWniT6PbZSrI/) if you're using an Android device.  
3. Disabling ads on Reddit with [an ad-blocking extension](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin-ubo) or [a DNS-based ad-blocker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBXTnrD_Zs4).  
4. Cancelling your Reddit Premium subscription.  
5. Sharing the continued news coverage of these events.  
6. Encouraging others to do all the above.

I can understand older skins and models not having it because they have to redesign/make it compatible. But void shell is just an afterthought I feel in their workflow and is disappointing that it isn't a systemic change."

How can people live like this?,"Are you between 16-24 years old and in the United States? If so look into Job Corps [https://www.jobcorps.gov/i-am-a/student](https://www.jobcorps.gov/i-am-a/student)

They will pay to transport you, house you, feed you, pay you a small stipend for clothing and personal items, and get you basic medical, dental & mental health services. Mostly they would focus on education and job training. All free to you with the US Department of Labor paying \~$40k+ per student. 

As a homeless youth you would have top priority to get a bed as soon as one is open in your region. Ideally you can get out of a bad living situation, get some therapy, and come out with a skilled trade apprenticeship or valuable job certification to land better paying & in demand work."

"Seriously, how do poor people afford children in the US?","In my experience, people with higher incomes often overestimate the cost of caring for a child. Parents often *want* to spend more on their child, but that's different from saying you *can't* afford children if you don't have that much money. Like consider how many parents are concerned about moving to a neighborhood with good schools, or paying private school tuition, while poor parents send their child to the local public school for free because that's the only practical option for them. 

There are also a lot of benefits programs available to the poor, and especially those with children in the home. This can mean that a significant gap in wage income is not as big of an economic gap as it seems, because middle-income people are funding more of their own expenses. For example, you pay a health insurance deductible for medical costs (I assume you're thinking of the costs for birth after insurance right?), while people on Medicaid have almost nonexistent deductibles or copay."

I was called 'gross' in a queer friendly club,"I'm so, so sorry you had to deal with such a piece of shit treating you like this.  And especially in a space you're supposed to feel safe.  You mentioned it was a queer bar and, if you feel safe to take action, the first thing to do when somebody is being transphobic is to go to the bartender, point the person harassing you out, and tell them what happened.  ""That woman was assaulting and harassing me as I was trying to use the bathroom"" is all you should need to say in that situation.  And I want to take this time to clarify that she DID assault you by grabbing you.  You may have been patient (far more patient than she deserved) but that doesn't change the fact that she continually put her hands on you without consent.  I'm an androgynous enby and in my experience, most bartenders in queer spaces are more than willing to help.  And when they can't immediately do anything to help, they'll appreciate you telling them so that they can keep an eye on that person."

Brb ü§Æ,"As you're all aware, this subreddit has had a major ""troll"" 
problem which has gotten worse (as of recently). Due to this, we 
have created new rules, and modified some of the old ones.

We kindly ask that you please familiarize yourself with the 
rules so that you can avoid breaking them. Breaking mild rules 
will result in a warning, or a temporary ban. Breaking serious 
rules, or breaking a plethora of mild ones may land you a 
permanent ban (depending on the severity). Also, 
grifting/lurking has been a major problem; If we suspect you of 
being a grifter (determined by vetting said user's activity), we 
may ban you without warning.

You may attempt an appeal via ModMail, but please be advised not 
to use rude, harassing, foul, or passive-aggressive language 
towards the moderators, _or_ complain to moderators about why we 
have specific rules in the first place‚Äî You will be ignored, and 
your ban will remain (without even a consideration). 

All rules are made public; ""Lack of knowledge"" or ""ignorance of 
the rules"" cannot or will not be a viable excuse if you end up 
banned for breaking them (This applies to the Subreddit rules, 
and Reddit's ToS). **Again: All rules are made public, and 
Reddit gives you the option to review the rules once more before 
submitting a post, it is your choice if you choose to read them 
or not, but breaking them will not be acceptable.**

With that being said, If you send a mature, neutral message 
regarding questions about a current ban, or a ban appeal 
(without ""not knowing the rules"" as an excuse), we will 
elaborate about why you were banned, or determine/consider if we 
will shorten, lift, keep it, _or_ extended it/make it permanent. 
This all means that appeals are discretionary, and your 
reasoning for wanting an appeal must be practical and valid.

Thank you all so much for taking the time to read this message, 
and please enjoy your day!

On July 1st, a highly unpopular [change to Reddit's API pricing](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/) went into effect. [Most third-party apps have shut down](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23779519/reddit-third-party-app-shut-down-apollo-sync-baconreader-api-protest) and so have many tools relied upon by moderators and [projects for making Reddit more accessible to visually impaired users](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/comments/14ggf8k/the_future_of_transcribers_of_reddit/). 

Beyond the [disastrous AMA](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/09/reddit-ceo-doubles-down-on-attack-on-apollo-developer-in-drama-filled-ama/) by the CEO, Reddit's response has been limited to promises that this change will not affect moderation tools [^((it has)^)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BotDefense/comments/14riw76/botdefense_is_wrapping_up_operations/) and promises of [new and more-accessible first-party moderation tools](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/01/1184258201/reddit-api-accessibility-mods). Promises just like [ones they have made in response to past protests](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/142w159/askhistorians_and_uncertainty_surrounding_the/), but have consistently [failed to fulfill](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/14jm3ut/several_communities_have_surfaced_an_open_letter/jpm9e0q/). 

If you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:

1. [Finding your favorite subreddits on other platforms](https://sub.rehab/) and participating there instead.  
2. Refraining from using the first-party Reddit app, instead sticking to one of the few remaining third-party apps or [patching one of the apps that shut down](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1wHvqQwCYdJrQg4BKlGIVDLksPN0KpOnJWniT6PbZSrI/) if you're using an Android device.  
3. Disabling ads on Reddit with [an ad-blocking extension](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin-ubo) or [a DNS-based ad-blocker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBXTnrD_Zs4).  
4. Cancelling your Reddit Premium subscription.  
5. Sharing the continued news coverage of these events.  
6. Encouraging others to do all the above.

How realistic is such orbital proximity?,"Yes, in fact there is a really good example of this in our own solar system. The planet Saturn has two moons, Epimetheus and Janus, which are co-orbital. This means they move around Saturn at a similar distance from Saturn. When Epimetheus has a slightly lower orbit than Janus, it has a shorter orbital period (or year length), so it eventually will catch up to Janus. As the two moons come close together the gravitational interaction causes Janus to slow down, dropping it lower in orbit, causes Epimetheus to speed up, raising the moon in orbit. So essentially the two moons exchange places through a sort of slingshot interaction but since Epimetheus is now higher in orbit it takes longer to orbit and now Janus will be moving slower but at a lower orbit so will have a faster orbital period. The two moons basically swap back and forth every so many years. 

Because of the orbital nature of these moons and their gravitational interaction they never get closer than 9000 miles apart so they never collide, but 9000 miles is very close in space terms considering earths moon is around 240000 miles from earth."

You were groomed and taken advantage of when you were 15 years old. Everything you mention, including your body enjoying the sensations yet emotionally being scared, are common for victims of sexual abuse. Although you consented and your body was able to become erect, emotionally you were not ready for that sexual experience. It feels confusing, but your body did what the body of any teenage boy would‚Äôve done in that moment (hormones/puberty). This is another common experience for children/teens who are victims of sexual abuse. All these years later, the person who should feel dirty is the 45 year old woman who took advantage of an innocent boy. I hope you are able to find peace with this situation. I hope that you are able to free yourself from blame and shame and realize this was not your fault. Also, therapy and processing these emotions will be very beneficial. You did not deserve that."

What exactly did we do?,"Hello there, Peter here.

Let‚Äôs talk a bit about the conduct of Canadian soldiers during World War I, which took place from 1914 to 1918, and the Geneva Conventions, established in the late 19th century.

---
During this time, Canadian soldiers were involved in incidents such as killing surrendering soldiers, engaging in brutal trench raids and unlawful treatment of prisoners.

It's important to note that the full framework of the modern Geneva Conventions was not in place during World War I. These Conventions, with principles for the humane treatment of wounded soldiers, prisoners of war, and non-combatants, had their roots in the late 19th century.

The experiences of World War I significantly influenced the development of international humanitarian law, including the Geneva Conventions, to prevent such violations in future conflicts and establish clear standards for the conduct of war.

My ILs did not like this and some of what they said makes me question if I made the right decision in explaining things the way I did.

Todays entity is from Germany and the USA

PracticalNeat4511 guessed correctly todays entity is the Bockmann, or buck man, a type of Feldgeister; or field spirit.

Also known as the Bockelmann and Bockem√¢ which both mean buck man, or Bockk√™rl which mean buck guy.

The Bockmann appears as a goat human hybrid Feldgeister, though how the hybrid parts combine  varies.  The most commonly reported form has goat horns with a human head, arms, and torso with goat legs or feet.    Its hands are often described as having talons instead of fingernails, and its eyes are those of a goat.  Other forms have been reported, however all are a combination of goat and human features.  Like most Feldgeister the Bockmann will have features of the field it resides in, such as corn yellow hair and corn stalk and corn husk textured fur if it lives in a corn field.  One of the interesting physical features of the Bockmann is its human features resemble a child who once lived in the area it now resides in, though often aged up a bit.  A child who went missing, never to be seen again.  This is because all Bockmann, except potentially the oldest of them; were once those very missing children they so closely resemble.

The Bockmann is not the sort of Feldgeister you want to have in your fields.  His mere presence causes crops to wither and become diseased, and he will also actively destroy crops on his own.  However the Bockmann also has one more habit that makes it imperative that he be permanently 
dealt with as quickly as possible.

The Bockmann steal children, and they are extremely patient when it comes to kidnapping their preferred prey.  Bockmann will watch from the fields, stalking the children they desire to steal.  The Bockmann  will even wait multiple harvest seasons for a chance to steal a particular child that has caught their eye, though they will settle for another one if given the opportunity.  Bockmann are masters of stealth and staying hidden, so if left to their own devices they will eventually capture the child they have been hunting.

Now what happens next is not exactly clear, however what is known is that whatever follows the kidnapping leads to the stolen child becoming another Bockmann. The truly horrifying part is that since Bockmann are field spirits, the process to turn those stolen children into new Bockmann will always include the child‚Äôs demise; and rebirth as a Feldgeister.  There is no way to reverse the transformation into a Bockmann once it has occurred.

This is why it is important to get rid of a Bockmann as early as possible, preferably the moment you become aware of its presence.

Since Feldgeister are immortal field spirits that will return year after year, so the only way to stop a Bockmann is to kill it permanently.  Unlike other Field spirits, waiting till harvest season is not an option.  This means in order to save children from the hands of the Bockmann, you must kill the Bockmann permanently; which means killing a being who was once a kidnapped child.

To kill a Bockmann you can wait till harvest season and harvest all the crops, or you can use the harvest doll ceremony to trap it.  However doing this before harvesting the fields means finding the Bockmann and sealing them in the doll directly, which is no easy task.  

After sealing the Bockmann you must burn the doll, which will also burn the Bockmann trapped inside; killing it.  You can also attempt to use iron implements to harm or restrain the Bockmann, making the process of sealing it into the harvest doll easier.


There is also the option of an ‚Äúaccidental‚Äù fire burning the entire field to ash, but please only do this if you are well insured.

Like all Feldgeister, direct contact with the Bockmann will lead to severe illness and potentially death.

Your exact feelings are likely a manifestation of whatever you‚Äôre struggling with and telling him you want to go because you hate him may put your marriage on a crash course."
To normalize occupation ,"**FROM THE RIVER TO THE SEA PALESTINE WILL BE FREE**

---

This phrase indicates a desire for a free and secular Palestine for the people, free of the imperialistic apartheid policies of the government of Israel.  It is not a statement of violence, nor does it wish harm on the Israeli people themselves, nor Jewish people as a whole.

"If I buy a Duke title from the same place my friend owns a Lord title, does he have to call me ""Your Grace""?","This has nothing to do with the legitimacy (or in this case, lack thereof) of the title. It‚Äôs just a logical paradigm. If you‚Äôre saying he recognizes this as a legitimate font for his own title, then he must recognize the same for yours. 

That doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôll have to do anything or care, but the legitimacy of your thing will be the same as his, just, as you said, higher on the hierarchy

Why are we continuing to give money to such an abusive government who is obviously bent on world domination?  Just look at the moves in the South China sea, theyre not going to stop that shit while their economy is being propped up by everyone buying their shit.

So we wont give them military or tech secrets, but lets leave our the majority of our production lines with them...

"Real talk here, what options are realistic replacements for DC during mid-season?","The thing that makes no sense was hiring Wilks in the first place. Why bring an in an outside hire when you wanted to run the same system? The best bet was to hire from within. Instead the FO over thought it, and outsourced a hire for someone who is proving to be be unfit for the job. 

To answer your question, IF Wilks were to be let go mid season, I can see our LB coach Johnny Holland being promoted to the DC position. I remember some rumblings during the off-season about him being a candidate for the position, and our LBs seem to be the only functioning group on defense anyways."
a woman being a medical professional = ‚Äúautomatic cringe‚Äù apparently,"As you're all aware, this subreddit has had a major ""troll"" 
problem which has gotten worse (as of recently). Due to this, we 
have created new rules, and modified some of the old ones.

We kindly ask that you please familiarize yourself with the 
rules so that you can avoid breaking them. Breaking mild rules 
will result in a warning, or a temporary ban. Breaking serious 
rules, or breaking a plethora of mild ones may land you a 
permanent ban (depending on the severity). Also, 
grifting/lurking has been a major problem; If we suspect you of 
being a grifter (determined by vetting said user's activity), we 
may ban you without warning.

You may attempt an appeal via ModMail, but please be advised not 
to use rude, harassing, foul, or passive-aggressive language 
towards the moderators, _or_ complain to moderators about why we 
have specific rules in the first place‚Äî You will be ignored, and 
your ban will remain (without even a consideration). 

All rules are made public; ""Lack of knowledge"" or ""ignorance of 
the rules"" cannot or will not be a viable excuse if you end up 
banned for breaking them (This applies to the Subreddit rules, 
and Reddit's ToS). **Again: All rules are made public, and 
Reddit gives you the option to review the rules once more before 
submitting a post, it is your choice if you choose to read them 
or not, but breaking them will not be acceptable.**

With that being said, If you send a mature, neutral message 
regarding questions about a current ban, or a ban appeal 
(without ""not knowing the rules"" as an excuse), we will 
elaborate about why you were banned, or determine/consider if we 
will shorten, lift, keep it, _or_ extended it/make it permanent. 
This all means that appeals are discretionary, and your 
reasoning for wanting an appeal must be practical and valid.

Thank you all so much for taking the time to read this message, 
and please enjoy your day!

Why does only this guy wield his legendary weapon (which he stole) but the other misbegotten don't?,"In the game files the Leonine Misbegotten are called ""Children of Radagon"" and with some item descriptions talking about Radagon having some kind of shame wrapped up in his red hair and that shame being tied to the Firegiants, it is likely that an earlier version of the game script had Radagon's red hair as a much more important role in the story and a much more significant symbol, especially since most of his demigod children share his red hair. This is what happens with gaming scripts, they are constantly in flux and ever changing as deadlines, playtesting and mechanical and engine limitations rear their head. This Misbegotten having the sword that we know was Rennala's proposal-sword to Radagon now reforged to show his loyalty to the Golden Order is likely a reminant at those earlier themes"

Of course, if you're a member of said sub and you were already in the thread before, this doesn't apply to you.*

**Rule 11: Keep Posts Relevant (only about Don Cheadle)**: *This is first and foremost a place to make fun of gamers. Just because someone is being a bigot online doesn't mean it belongs here. Let them be pathetic without infecting the sub with their nonsense. Please avoid posting screenshots that show people using capital G gamer slurs.* **If absolutely necessary, please censor posts and the words containing such content.**

**Rule 12: No Fake Posts on Other Subs (Contamination)**: *Do not create fake posts on other subs only to post back here. Also, do not ""lol, you should post this on r / OtherSub"". It's considered interfering with their content and can also lead to brigading.*

"If BG3 wins GOTY, do you think it will influence developers?","The success of BG3 will almost certainly influence developers, just probably not in the way we all wish it would. It'll happen regardless of it winning GotY or not.

They're not gonna take away that they should spend  6 years making high quality content. That's never the take away that publishers have from these things. They'll think ""cRPGs can sell a lot of copies, let's churn something out in a couple of years to cash in on this trend"". We might see BioWare talk about a ""return to form"" now that Larian is showing their original formula still sells.

It also isn't likely to affect small to mid sized developers. There's already a lot of good cRPGs in the last decade from that space. The main reason why they don't make anything like Baldur's Gate 3 has to do with a lack of funding."

Laredo Firearms Weapon Catalog,"After the success of my post with the Combatech weapons catalog, Ive decided to expand the Starfield weapons section with the Laredo catalog.

Ive taken note of what you liked the most and the suggestions you write down. For Laredo Ive focused the design on using a mixture of the two materials used in weapons: wood and steel. A classic and far western style (I'm a big fan of red dead redemption), but without forgetting that we are in 2330.

I have added a new page to complement and expand with more info. Ive written a small text with an commercial style, as well as slogans that seem like they want to sell you Laredo products. Everything to set the mood and give a realistic touch to the catalogue.

Also, and following one of the suggestions received, I‚Äôve added a small section with a summary of all the Laredo weapons with their numerical specs, for better quick glimpse.

Again, forgive my average level of English. Im open to looking for ways to improve the catalogue, its texts, its design and its display.

On July 1st, a highly unpopular [change to Reddit's API pricing](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/) went into effect. [Most third-party apps have shut down](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23779519/reddit-third-party-app-shut-down-apollo-sync-baconreader-api-protest) and so have many tools relied upon by moderators and [projects for making Reddit more accessible to visually impaired users](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/comments/14ggf8k/the_future_of_transcribers_of_reddit/). 

Beyond the [disastrous AMA](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/09/reddit-ceo-doubles-down-on-attack-on-apollo-developer-in-drama-filled-ama/) by the CEO, Reddit's response has been limited to promises that this change will not affect moderation tools [^((it has)^)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BotDefense/comments/14riw76/botdefense_is_wrapping_up_operations/) and promises of [new and more-accessible first-party moderation tools](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/01/1184258201/reddit-api-accessibility-mods). Promises just like [ones they have made in response to past protests](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/142w159/askhistorians_and_uncertainty_surrounding_the/), but have consistently [failed to fulfill](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/14jm3ut/several_communities_have_surfaced_an_open_letter/jpm9e0q/). 

If you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:

1. [Finding your favorite subreddits on other platforms](https://sub.rehab/) and participating there instead.  
2. Refraining from using the first-party Reddit app, instead sticking to one of the few remaining third-party apps or [patching one of the apps that shut down](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1wHvqQwCYdJrQg4BKlGIVDLksPN0KpOnJWniT6PbZSrI/) if you're using an Android device.  
3. Disabling ads on Reddit with [an ad-blocking extension](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin-ubo) or [a DNS-based ad-blocker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBXTnrD_Zs4).  
4. Cancelling your Reddit Premium subscription.  
5. Sharing the continued news coverage of these events.  
6. Encouraging others to do all the above.

Do YOU condemn?,"On Oct 7th, most Israeli civilians who were killed or burnt, including babies, were actually killed & burnt by IDF Hannibal directive. So, do you condemn Israel for killing & burning their own people? [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J1I96fTKnM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J1I96fTKnM)

The premise of the question is not to ask & and answer a question, but instead, tell a fake narrative that gives an excuse & greenlight to genocide. In other words, there's no question, it's more like ""Israel is going to genocide because of reasons. We don't suspect the reasons, we want you to condemn yourself for being brutally annihilated"""

Britney also remembers her sister being ungrateful after she bought the family ""a house for Jamie Lynn to grow up in.""

At that time Jamie was a kid, I understand feeling jealous because they were treated very differently but Britney's now old enough to realize it was her mother's fault not her little sister's. 

It's ironic considering her boys have said she treated them differently, apparently she obviously favored one son over the other."
capitalism exists in everywhere,"There's particularly a reason why student loans are set up that way. It's because the moment you graduate, you would be able to declare bankruptcy incredibly easily. Years of potentially no income, few assets and no job.

1. r/religiousfruitcake is about the absurd, fringe elements of organised religion: the institutions and individuals who act in ways any normal religious person would cringe at. Posts about mundane beliefs and acts of worship are off topic.

2. Post titles should be a short, objective statement of content. They arent a pulpit: dont use the Title Field to preach personal opinions about religion or any other topic. Doing so will result in your post being removed.    

3. Refrain from provoking and/or baiting religious fruitcakes for the purposes of posting their reaction on this subreddit, or posting material featuring provocation by others.

Tell me you‚Äôve never had sex without telling me you‚Äôve never had sex,"As you're all aware, this subreddit has had a major ""troll"" 
problem which has gotten worse (as of recently). Due to this, we 
have created new rules, and modified some of the old ones.

We kindly ask that you please familiarize yourself with the 
rules so that you can avoid breaking them. Breaking mild rules 
will result in a warning, or a temporary ban. Breaking serious 
rules, or breaking a plethora of mild ones may land you a 
permanent ban (depending on the severity). Also, 
grifting/lurking has been a major problem; If we suspect you of 
being a grifter (determined by vetting said user's activity), we 
may ban you without warning.

You may attempt an appeal via ModMail, but please be advised not 
to use rude, harassing, foul, or passive-aggressive language 
towards the moderators, _or_ complain to moderators about why we 
have specific rules in the first place‚Äî You will be ignored, and 
your ban will remain (without even a consideration). 

All rules are made public; ""Lack of knowledge"" or ""ignorance of 
the rules"" cannot or will not be a viable excuse if you end up 
banned for breaking them (This applies to the Subreddit rules, 
and Reddit's ToS). **Again: All rules are made public, and 
Reddit gives you the option to review the rules once more before 
submitting a post, it is your choice if you choose to read them 
or not, but breaking them will not be acceptable.**

With that being said, If you send a mature, neutral message 
regarding questions about a current ban, or a ban appeal 
(without ""not knowing the rules"" as an excuse), we will 
elaborate about why you were banned, or determine/consider if we 
will shorten, lift, keep it, _or_ extended it/make it permanent. 
This all means that appeals are discretionary, and your 
reasoning for wanting an appeal must be practical and valid.

Thank you all so much for taking the time to read this message,

On July 1st, a highly unpopular [change to Reddit's API pricing](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/) went into effect. [Most third-party apps have shut down](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23779519/reddit-third-party-app-shut-down-apollo-sync-baconreader-api-protest) and so have many tools relied upon by moderators and [projects for making Reddit more accessible to visually impaired users](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/comments/14ggf8k/the_future_of_transcribers_of_reddit/). 

Beyond the [disastrous AMA](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/09/reddit-ceo-doubles-down-on-attack-on-apollo-developer-in-drama-filled-ama/) by the CEO, Reddit's response has been limited to promises that this change will not affect moderation tools [^((it has)^)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BotDefense/comments/14riw76/botdefense_is_wrapping_up_operations/) and promises of [new and more-accessible first-party moderation tools](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/01/1184258201/reddit-api-accessibility-mods). Promises just like [ones they have made in response to past protests](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/142w159/askhistorians_and_uncertainty_surrounding_the/), but have consistently [failed to fulfill](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/14jm3ut/several_communities_have_surfaced_an_open_letter/jpm9e0q/). 

If you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:

1. [Finding your favorite subreddits on other platforms](https://sub.rehab/) and participating there instead.  
2. Refraining from using the first-party Reddit app, instead sticking to one of the few remaining third-party apps or [patching one of the apps that shut down](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1wHvqQwCYdJrQg4BKlGIVDLksPN0KpOnJWniT6PbZSrI/) if you're using an Android device.  
3. Disabling ads on Reddit with [an ad-blocking extension](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin-ubo) or [a DNS-based ad-blocker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBXTnrD_Zs4).  
4. Cancelling your Reddit Premium subscription.  
5. Sharing the continued news coverage of these events.  
6. Encouraging others to do all the above.

Czech defense minister calls to exit UN over org's support of Hamas,"Just for some context, Cernochova is very hot headed. It's her opinion, but it is not the stance of our government and I'm yet to see anyone else from our government to share this sentiment. 

Which I feel is a shame, because UN truly needs a reform. As in its current form means absolutely nothing, when one of the security council members is a genocidal state or you have Saudi Arabia governing a human rights council. It's just a body to push meaningless statements nobody cares about. So what's the point of being in it?

update :),"It sounds like this is the best result. I'm glad he apologized.

I will say OP, please work on advocating for your feelings. The biggest thing I noticed in your original post is that you are *constantly* apologizing for having any feelings that might be even remotely uncomfortable for your ex. It's okay to have and express a negative emotion. It's okay to set a boundary and say ""I don't feel respected."" You don't need to tie yourself in knots to accommodate a person who is barely even acknowledging you. He was RUDE in those messages and you were completely valid in feeling insecure and neglected.

Empathy and compassion are great qualities, but they need to be balanced with self-respect or else you'll keep ending up in situations where people take advantage of your acquiescent nature."

On July 1st, a highly unpopular [change to Reddit's API pricing](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/) went into effect. [Most third-party apps have shut down](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23779519/reddit-third-party-app-shut-down-apollo-sync-baconreader-api-protest) and so have many tools relied upon by moderators and [projects for making Reddit more accessible to visually impaired users](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/comments/14ggf8k/the_future_of_transcribers_of_reddit/). 

Beyond the [disastrous AMA](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/09/reddit-ceo-doubles-down-on-attack-on-apollo-developer-in-drama-filled-ama/) by the CEO, Reddit's response has been limited to promises that this change will not affect moderation tools [^((it has)^)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BotDefense/comments/14riw76/botdefense_is_wrapping_up_operations/) and promises of [new and more-accessible first-party moderation tools](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/01/1184258201/reddit-api-accessibility-mods). Promises just like [ones they have made in response to past protests](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/142w159/askhistorians_and_uncertainty_surrounding_the/), but have consistently [failed to fulfill](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/14jm3ut/several_communities_have_surfaced_an_open_letter/jpm9e0q/). 

If you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:

1. [Finding your favorite subreddits on other platforms](https://sub.rehab/) and participating there instead.  
2. Refraining from using the first-party Reddit app, instead sticking to one of the few remaining third-party apps or [patching one of the apps that shut down](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1wHvqQwCYdJrQg4BKlGIVDLksPN0KpOnJWniT6PbZSrI/) if you're using an Android device.  
3. Disabling ads on Reddit with [an ad-blocking extension](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin-ubo) or [a DNS-based ad-blocker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBXTnrD_Zs4).  
4. Cancelling your Reddit Premium subscription.  
5. Sharing the continued news coverage of these events.  
6. Encouraging others to do all the above.

Reddit Admins have decided that [they want to kill off all 3rd-party apps](https://old.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/13yh0jf/dont_let_reddit_kill_3rd_party_apps/), [3rd-party bots, and everything else that makes Reddit barely usable](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13xh1e7/an_open_letter_on_the_state_of_affairs_regarding/). And, of course, that includes bots such as [\/u\/QualityVote](http://reddit.com/user/QualityVote), [\/u\/SaveVideo](http://reddit.com/user/SaveVideo), [\/u\/AuddBot](http://reddit.com/user/AuddBot), etc.

So you'll just have to put up with automod and a worse overall user experience in the meantime.
    
If you have any complaints, direct them at [the reddit admins instead](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/), because they're the ones seeking to ruin everyone's user experience.

"or even if got one with that mindset, i don't think they will like you very much","I have two siblings, a sister and a brother. They're twins.

I'm not fine with incest IRL, but I do not mind at all it in games. I'm also fine with jokes about it PRECISELY because I feel very confident there is no chance of incest in my household.

Otherwise this subreddit will just be a huge trauma trigger fest for me.

I'm also fine with it because my family members have zero chance of accessing my data despite knowing my passwords (I'll have you guess how that works). My parents are not fine with dark humour and my siblings are too young for this shit."

On July 1st, a highly unpopular [change to Reddit's API pricing](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/) went into effect. [Most third-party apps have shut down](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23779519/reddit-third-party-app-shut-down-apollo-sync-baconreader-api-protest) and so have many tools relied upon by moderators and [projects for making Reddit more accessible to visually impaired users](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/comments/14ggf8k/the_future_of_transcribers_of_reddit/). 

Beyond the [disastrous AMA](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/09/reddit-ceo-doubles-down-on-attack-on-apollo-developer-in-drama-filled-ama/) by the CEO, Reddit's response has been limited to promises that this change will not affect moderation tools [^((it has)^)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BotDefense/comments/14riw76/botdefense_is_wrapping_up_operations/) and promises of [new and more-accessible first-party moderation tools](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/01/1184258201/reddit-api-accessibility-mods). Promises just like [ones they have made in response to past protests](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/142w159/askhistorians_and_uncertainty_surrounding_the/), but have consistently [failed to fulfill](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/14jm3ut/several_communities_have_surfaced_an_open_letter/jpm9e0q/). 

If you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:

1. [Finding your favorite subreddits on other platforms](https://sub.rehab/) and participating there instead.  
2. Refraining from using the first-party Reddit app, instead sticking to one of the few remaining third-party apps or [patching one of the apps that shut down](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1wHvqQwCYdJrQg4BKlGIVDLksPN0KpOnJWniT6PbZSrI/) if you're using an Android device.  
3. Disabling ads on Reddit with [an ad-blocking extension](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin-ubo) or [a DNS-based ad-blocker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBXTnrD_Zs4).  
4. Cancelling your Reddit Premium subscription.  
5. Sharing the continued news coverage of these events.  
6. Encouraging others to do all the above.

On July 1st, a highly unpopular [change to Reddit's API pricing](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/) went into effect. [Most third-party apps have shut down](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23779519/reddit-third-party-app-shut-down-apollo-sync-baconreader-api-protest) and so have many tools relied upon by moderators and [projects for making Reddit more accessible to visually impaired users](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/comments/14ggf8k/the_future_of_transcribers_of_reddit/). 

Beyond the [disastrous AMA](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/09/reddit-ceo-doubles-down-on-attack-on-apollo-developer-in-drama-filled-ama/) by the CEO, Reddit's response has been limited to promises that this change will not affect moderation tools [^((it has)^)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BotDefense/comments/14riw76/botdefense_is_wrapping_up_operations/) and promises of [new and more-accessible first-party moderation tools](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/01/1184258201/reddit-api-accessibility-mods). Promises just like [ones they have made in response to past protests](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/142w159/askhistorians_and_uncertainty_surrounding_the/), but have consistently [failed to fulfill](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/14jm3ut/several_communities_have_surfaced_an_open_letter/jpm9e0q/). 

If you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:

1. [Finding your favorite subreddits on other platforms](https://sub.rehab/) and participating there instead.  
2. Refraining from using the first-party Reddit app, instead sticking to one of the few remaining third-party apps or [patching one of the apps that shut down](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1wHvqQwCYdJrQg4BKlGIVDLksPN0KpOnJWniT6PbZSrI/) if you're using an Android device.  
3. Disabling ads on Reddit with [an ad-blocking extension](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin-ubo) or [a DNS-based ad-blocker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBXTnrD_Zs4).  
4. Cancelling your Reddit Premium subscription.  
5. Sharing the continued news coverage of these events.  
6. Encouraging others to do all the above.

So you'll just have to put up with automod and a worse overall user experience in the meantime.
    
If you have any complaints, direct them at [the reddit admins instead](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/), because they're the ones seeking to ruin everyone's user experience.

"I figured this community would appreciate a more honest depiction of the popular ""loss of land"" format I've been working on regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict","I think this is pretty good overall but I'd say that the West Bank section for modern day isn't *quite* right.

You've included areas listed as ""Israel occupied"" and ""PA Civil Control"" but it would likely have been better to use the proper terminology: Areas A&B and Area C.

All of the West Bank is occupied, while the PA only maintains *partial* civil control over Areas A&B, so the way you've laid it out could lead to misconceptions about the current set up.

Something far less important but I would've included personally is a distinction between Egypt and Gaza in slide 4. As, unlike Jordan which illegally annexed the West Bank, Egypt set up the [All Palestine Protectorate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Palestine_Protectorate) as a nominally self-ruling entity"
Do LPL toplaners at worlds not like playing Rumble,"If we look at the four LPL tops at worlds: 

First things first 

ThShy 

TheShy is well and truly the Rumble King of the LPL alongside Shanji and weirdly, his teammate: Xiaohu. 

TheShy has 25 games on Rumble in his career with a *Monstrous* 84% Win rate (his highest in any champion with more than 10 games played). 

Ironically for a man we most remember for dumpstering lanes in 2018, TheShy is a much heavier team fighting Orientated top laner, he has frequently been on teams with multiple engage/frontline options and has been free to play champions like Rumble which require other team mates to generate space/engage. 


JDG 369

369 Mostly plays front-line champions to enable JDG‚Äôs front-to-back team fighting around Ruler.  When he‚Äôs picking a full blown carry, it‚Äôs usually a team fighting carry like GP, Kennen/Aatrox. 
Occasionally plays split pushers. 

*He does not have a SINGLE rumble game in 560 games of professional play* 


LNG Zika 
 
Zika has only been playing at top level pro for two years (22/23) during that time Rumble has almost never been meta, baring a brief stint where he was a Mid laner/Jungler 

Given that, there was very little reason to practise the champion. 

Zika is primarily a duelist/splitpusher, with a heavy emphasis on Jax/Renekton/Camille/Gwen. 

*Zika has 1 Rumble Game in his career, which he played (ironically against 369) during summer playoffs, which LNG lost*


Bin 

Similar to Zika, Bin is primarily a Duelist/Splitpusher with a heavy focus on Renekton/Jax/Gnar/Gwen 

Bin has also not been active during a time when Rumble was a dominant top lane meta pick. 

*Bin does not have a single Rumble game in 619 professional games*"

On July 1st, a highly unpopular [change to Reddit's API pricing](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/) went into effect. [Most third-party apps have shut down](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23779519/reddit-third-party-app-shut-down-apollo-sync-baconreader-api-protest) and so have many tools relied upon by moderators and [projects for making Reddit more accessible to visually impaired users](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/comments/14ggf8k/the_future_of_transcribers_of_reddit/). 

Beyond the [disastrous AMA](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/09/reddit-ceo-doubles-down-on-attack-on-apollo-developer-in-drama-filled-ama/) by the CEO, Reddit's response has been limited to promises that this change will not affect moderation tools [^((it has)^)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BotDefense/comments/14riw76/botdefense_is_wrapping_up_operations/) and promises of [new and more-accessible first-party moderation tools](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/01/1184258201/reddit-api-accessibility-mods). Promises just like [ones they have made in response to past protests](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/142w159/askhistorians_and_uncertainty_surrounding_the/), but have consistently [failed to fulfill](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/14jm3ut/several_communities_have_surfaced_an_open_letter/jpm9e0q/). 

If you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:

1. [Finding your favorite subreddits on other platforms](https://sub.rehab/) and participating there instead.  
2. Refraining from using the first-party Reddit app, instead sticking to one of the few remaining third-party apps or [patching one of the apps that shut down](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1wHvqQwCYdJrQg4BKlGIVDLksPN0KpOnJWniT6PbZSrI/) if you're using an Android device.  
3. Disabling ads on Reddit with [an ad-blocking extension](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin-ubo) or [a DNS-based ad-blocker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBXTnrD_Zs4).  
4. Cancelling your Reddit Premium subscription.  
5. Sharing the continued news coverage of these events.  
6. Encouraging others to do all the above.  

If you're tired of all the chaos on Reddit, leave it behind and join /r/aww's Discord server to share and view all things adorable: https://discord.gg/UXfd5Pn

"It is not balanced for most of us, isn't it?","The problem isn't the schedule, it's the work outside of school. It would be better if they set more concrete boundaries like school is work/study time and when you go home it's you time.

This just ends up burning out the student and making them not pay attention during school because they don't get a break."

On July 1st, a highly unpopular [change to Reddit's API pricing](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/) went into effect. [Most third-party apps have shut down](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23779519/reddit-third-party-app-shut-down-apollo-sync-baconreader-api-protest) and so have many tools relied upon by moderators and [projects for making Reddit more accessible to visually impaired users](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/comments/14ggf8k/the_future_of_transcribers_of_reddit/). 

Beyond the [disastrous AMA](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/09/reddit-ceo-doubles-down-on-attack-on-apollo-developer-in-drama-filled-ama/) by the CEO, Reddit's response has been limited to promises that this change will not affect moderation tools [^((it has)^)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BotDefense/comments/14riw76/botdefense_is_wrapping_up_operations/) and promises of [new and more-accessible first-party moderation tools](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/01/1184258201/reddit-api-accessibility-mods). Promises just like [ones they have made in response to past protests](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/142w159/askhistorians_and_uncertainty_surrounding_the/), but have consistently [failed to fulfill](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/14jm3ut/several_communities_have_surfaced_an_open_letter/jpm9e0q/). 

If you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:

1. [Finding your favorite subreddits on other platforms](https://sub.rehab/) and participating there instead.  
2. Refraining from using the first-party Reddit app, instead sticking to one of the few remaining third-party apps or [patching one of the apps that shut down](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1wHvqQwCYdJrQg4BKlGIVDLksPN0KpOnJWniT6PbZSrI/) if you're using an Android device.  
3. Disabling ads on Reddit with [an ad-blocking extension](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin-ubo) or [a DNS-based ad-blocker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBXTnrD_Zs4).  
4. Cancelling your Reddit Premium subscription.  
5. Sharing the continued news coverage of these events.  
6. Encouraging others to do all the above.

On July 1st, a highly unpopular [change to Reddit's API pricing](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/) went into effect. [Most third-party apps have shut down](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23779519/reddit-third-party-app-shut-down-apollo-sync-baconreader-api-protest) and so have many tools relied upon by moderators and [projects for making Reddit more accessible to visually impaired users](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/comments/14ggf8k/the_future_of_transcribers_of_reddit/). 

Beyond the [disastrous AMA](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/09/reddit-ceo-doubles-down-on-attack-on-apollo-developer-in-drama-filled-ama/) by the CEO, Reddit's response has been limited to promises that this change will not affect moderation tools [^((it has)^)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BotDefense/comments/14riw76/botdefense_is_wrapping_up_operations/) and promises of [new and more-accessible first-party moderation tools](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/01/1184258201/reddit-api-accessibility-mods). Promises just like [ones they have made in response to past protests](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/142w159/askhistorians_and_uncertainty_surrounding_the/), but have consistently [failed to fulfill](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/14jm3ut/several_communities_have_surfaced_an_open_letter/jpm9e0q/). 

If you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:

1. [Finding your favorite subreddits on other platforms](https://sub.rehab/) and participating there instead.  
2. Refraining from using the first-party Reddit app, instead sticking to one of the few remaining third-party apps or [patching one of the apps that shut down](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1wHvqQwCYdJrQg4BKlGIVDLksPN0KpOnJWniT6PbZSrI/) if you're using an Android device.  
3. Disabling ads on Reddit with [an ad-blocking extension](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin-ubo) or [a DNS-based ad-blocker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBXTnrD_Zs4).  
4. Cancelling your Reddit Premium subscription.  
5. Sharing the continued news coverage of these events.  
6. Encouraging others to do all the above.

Utility meters in an apartment building.,"The little red boxes on the right of each meter are Earthquake Valves. There‚Äôs a little metal ball inside that will roll into the flow of gas whenever there‚Äôs an earthquake (or enough vibration to move it) to prevent the flow of gas going into the building as a safety measure. 

They‚Äôre a standard item for most homes and apartments in the Los Angeles area. 

This setup is common for most utilities at buildings - the phone company/cable company has a room where their lines come into the building and are tied into the wiring for each apartment. Same for electricity."

On July 1st, a highly unpopular [change to Reddit's API pricing](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/) went into effect. [Most third-party apps have shut down](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23779519/reddit-third-party-app-shut-down-apollo-sync-baconreader-api-protest) and so have many tools relied upon by moderators and [projects for making Reddit more accessible to visually impaired users](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/comments/14ggf8k/the_future_of_transcribers_of_reddit/). 

Beyond the [disastrous AMA](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/09/reddit-ceo-doubles-down-on-attack-on-apollo-developer-in-drama-filled-ama/) by the CEO, Reddit's response has been limited to promises that this change will not affect moderation tools [^((it has)^)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BotDefense/comments/14riw76/botdefense_is_wrapping_up_operations/) and promises of [new and more-accessible first-party moderation tools](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/01/1184258201/reddit-api-accessibility-mods). Promises just like [ones they have made in response to past protests](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/142w159/askhistorians_and_uncertainty_surrounding_the/), but have consistently [failed to fulfill](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/14jm3ut/several_communities_have_surfaced_an_open_letter/jpm9e0q/). 

If you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:

1. [Finding your favorite subreddits on other platforms](https://sub.rehab/) and participating there instead.  
2. Refraining from using the first-party Reddit app, instead sticking to one of the few remaining third-party apps or [patching one of the apps that shut down](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1wHvqQwCYdJrQg4BKlGIVDLksPN0KpOnJWniT6PbZSrI/) if you're using an Android device.  
3. Disabling ads on Reddit with [an ad-blocking extension](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin-ubo) or [a DNS-based ad-blocker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBXTnrD_Zs4).  
4. Cancelling your Reddit Premium subscription.  
5. Sharing the continued news coverage of these events.  
6. Encouraging others to do all the above.  

If you're tired of all the chaos on Reddit, leave it behind and join /r/aww's Discord server to share and view all things adorable: https://discord.gg/UXfd5Pn

On July 1st, a highly unpopular [change to Reddit's API pricing](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/) went into effect. [Most third-party apps have shut down](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23779519/reddit-third-party-app-shut-down-apollo-sync-baconreader-api-protest) and so have many tools relied upon by moderators and [projects for making Reddit more accessible to visually impaired users](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/comments/14ggf8k/the_future_of_transcribers_of_reddit/). 

Beyond the [disastrous AMA](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/09/reddit-ceo-doubles-down-on-attack-on-apollo-developer-in-drama-filled-ama/) by the CEO, Reddit's response has been limited to promises that this change will not affect moderation tools [^((it has)^)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BotDefense/comments/14riw76/botdefense_is_wrapping_up_operations/) and promises of [new and more-accessible first-party moderation tools](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/01/1184258201/reddit-api-accessibility-mods). Promises just like [ones they have made in response to past protests](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/142w159/askhistorians_and_uncertainty_surrounding_the/), but have consistently [failed to fulfill](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/14jm3ut/several_communities_have_surfaced_an_open_letter/jpm9e0q/). 

If you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:

1. [Finding your favorite subreddits on other platforms](https://sub.rehab/) and participating there instead.  
2. Refraining from using the first-party Reddit app, instead sticking to one of the few remaining third-party apps or [patching one of the apps that shut down](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1wHvqQwCYdJrQg4BKlGIVDLksPN0KpOnJWniT6PbZSrI/) if you're using an Android device.

[Most third-party apps have shut down](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23779519/reddit-third-party-app-shut-down-apollo-sync-baconreader-api-protest) and so have many tools relied upon by moderators and [projects for making Reddit more accessible to visually impaired users](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/comments/14ggf8k/the_future_of_transcribers_of_reddit/). 

Beyond the [disastrous AMA](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/09/reddit-ceo-doubles-down-on-attack-on-apollo-developer-in-drama-filled-ama/) by the CEO, Reddit's response has been limited to promises that this change will not affect moderation tools [^((it has)^)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BotDefense/comments/14riw76/botdefense_is_wrapping_up_operations/) and promises of [new and more-accessible first-party moderation tools](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/01/1184258201/reddit-api-accessibility-mods).

Police tried to check on the Maine gunman over concerns he could ‚Äòsnap and commit a mass shooting‚Äô | CNN,"Are you serious, Cops were sent to Maine gunman‚Äôs home weeks before massacres amid concern he ‚Äòis going to snap and commit a mass shooting, so they knew he was a ticking time bomb.

That is inexcusable, WTF, there was complete lack of follow-through to make sure the man was not a danger despite serious warning signs that were known by authorities and are now being detailed for the first time. Makes me sick."

Johnny Depp and Matthew Perry at The Limelight in New York City ¬∑ 1987,"‚ÄúI've had a lot of ups and downs in my life. I'm still working through it personally, but the best thing about me is that if an alcoholic or drug addict comes up to me and says, 'Will you help me?' I will always say, 'Yes, I know how to do that. I will do that for you, even if I can't always do it for myself! So I do that, whenever I can. In groups, or one on one.

And I created the Perry House in Malibu, a sober-living facility for men. I also wrote my play The End of Longing, which is a personal message to the world, an exaggerated form of me as a drunk. I had something important to say to people like me, and to people who love people like me.

When I die, I know people will talk about Friends, Friends, Friends. And I'm glad of that, happy l've done some solid work as an actor, as well as given people multiple chances to make fun of my struggles on the world wide web...

but when I die, as far as my so-called accomplishments go, it would be nice if Friends were listed far behind the things I did to try to help other people.

I know it won't happen, but it would be nice.""

On July 1st, a highly unpopular [change to Reddit's API pricing](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/) went into effect. [Most third-party apps have shut down](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23779519/reddit-third-party-app-shut-down-apollo-sync-baconreader-api-protest) and so have many tools relied upon by moderators and [projects for making Reddit more accessible to visually impaired users](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/comments/14ggf8k/the_future_of_transcribers_of_reddit/). 

Beyond the [disastrous AMA](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/09/reddit-ceo-doubles-down-on-attack-on-apollo-developer-in-drama-filled-ama/) by the CEO, Reddit's response has been limited to promises that this change will not affect moderation tools [^((it has)^)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BotDefense/comments/14riw76/botdefense_is_wrapping_up_operations/) and promises of [new and more-accessible first-party moderation tools](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/01/1184258201/reddit-api-accessibility-mods). Promises just like [ones they have made in response to past protests](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/142w159/askhistorians_and_uncertainty_surrounding_the/), but have consistently [failed to fulfill](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/14jm3ut/several_communities_have_surfaced_an_open_letter/jpm9e0q/). 

If you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:

1. [Finding your favorite subreddits on other platforms](https://sub.rehab/) and participating there instead.  
2. Refraining from using the first-party Reddit app, instead sticking to one of the few remaining third-party apps or [patching one of the apps that shut down](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1wHvqQwCYdJrQg4BKlGIVDLksPN0KpOnJWniT6PbZSrI/) if you're using an Android device.  
3. Disabling ads on Reddit with [an ad-blocking extension](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin-ubo) or [a DNS-based ad-blocker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBXTnrD_Zs4).  
4. Cancelling your Reddit Premium subscription.  
5. Sharing the continued news coverage of these events.  
6. Encouraging others to do all the above.

On July 1st, a highly unpopular [change to Reddit's API pricing](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/) went into effect. [Most third-party apps have shut down](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23779519/reddit-third-party-app-shut-down-apollo-sync-baconreader-api-protest) and so have many tools relied upon by moderators and [projects for making Reddit more accessible to visually impaired users](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/comments/14ggf8k/the_future_of_transcribers_of_reddit/). 

Beyond the [disastrous AMA](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/09/reddit-ceo-doubles-down-on-attack-on-apollo-developer-in-drama-filled-ama/) by the CEO, Reddit's response has been limited to promises that this change will not affect moderation tools [^((it has)^)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BotDefense/comments/14riw76/botdefense_is_wrapping_up_operations/) and promises of [new and more-accessible first-party moderation tools](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/01/1184258201/reddit-api-accessibility-mods). Promises just like [ones they have made in response to past protests](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/142w159/askhistorians_and_uncertainty_surrounding_the/), but have consistently [failed to fulfill](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/14jm3ut/several_communities_have_surfaced_an_open_letter/jpm9e0q/). 

If you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:

1. [Finding your favorite subreddits on other platforms](https://sub.rehab/) and participating there instead.  
2. Refraining from using the first-party Reddit app, instead sticking to one of the few remaining third-party apps or [patching one of the apps that shut down](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1wHvqQwCYdJrQg4BKlGIVDLksPN0KpOnJWniT6PbZSrI/) if you're using an Android device.

On July 1st, a highly unpopular [change to Reddit's API pricing](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/) went into effect. [Most third-party apps have shut down](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23779519/reddit-third-party-app-shut-down-apollo-sync-baconreader-api-protest) and so have many tools relied upon by moderators and [projects for making Reddit more accessible to visually impaired users](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/comments/14ggf8k/the_future_of_transcribers_of_reddit/). 

Beyond the [disastrous AMA](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/09/reddit-ceo-doubles-down-on-attack-on-apollo-developer-in-drama-filled-ama/) by the CEO, Reddit's response has been limited to promises that this change will not affect moderation tools [^((it has)^)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BotDefense/comments/14riw76/botdefense_is_wrapping_up_operations/) and promises of [new and more-accessible first-party moderation tools](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/01/1184258201/reddit-api-accessibility-mods). Promises just like [ones they have made in response to past protests](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/142w159/askhistorians_and_uncertainty_surrounding_the/), but have consistently [failed to fulfill](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/14jm3ut/several_communities_have_surfaced_an_open_letter/jpm9e0q/). 

If you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:

1. [Finding your favorite subreddits on other platforms](https://sub.rehab/) and participating there instead.  
2. Refraining from using the first-party Reddit app, instead sticking to one of the few remaining third-party apps or [patching one of the apps that shut down](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1wHvqQwCYdJrQg4BKlGIVDLksPN0KpOnJWniT6PbZSrI/) if you're using an Android device.  
3. Disabling ads on Reddit with [an ad-blocking extension](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin-ubo) or [a DNS-based ad-blocker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBXTnrD_Zs4).  
4. Cancelling your Reddit Premium subscription.  
5. Sharing the continued news coverage of these events.
