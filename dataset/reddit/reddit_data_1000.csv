On July 1st, a highly unpopular [change to Reddit's API pricing](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/) went into effect. [Most third-party apps have shut down](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23779519/reddit-third-party-app-shut-down-apollo-sync-baconreader-api-protest) and so have many tools relied upon by moderators and [projects for making Reddit more accessible to visually impaired users](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/comments/14ggf8k/the_future_of_transcribers_of_reddit/). 

Beyond the [disastrous AMA](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/09/reddit-ceo-doubles-down-on-attack-on-apollo-developer-in-drama-filled-ama/) by the CEO, Reddit's response has been limited to promises that this change will not affect moderation tools [^((it has)^)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BotDefense/comments/14riw76/botdefense_is_wrapping_up_operations/) and promises of [new and more-accessible first-party moderation tools](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/01/1184258201/reddit-api-accessibility-mods). Promises just like [ones they have made in response to past protests](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/142w159/askhistorians_and_uncertainty_surrounding_the/), but have consistently [failed to fulfill](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/14jm3ut/several_communities_have_surfaced_an_open_letter/jpm9e0q/). 

If you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:

1. [Finding your favorite subreddits on other platforms](https://sub.rehab/) and participating there instead.  
2. Refraining from using the first-party Reddit app, instead sticking to one of the few remaining third-party apps or [patching one of the apps that shut down](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1wHvqQwCYdJrQg4BKlGIVDLksPN0KpOnJWniT6PbZSrI/) if you're using an Android device.  
3. Disabling ads on Reddit with [an ad-blocking extension](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin-ubo) or [a DNS-based ad-blocker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBXTnrD_Zs4).  
4. Cancelling your Reddit Premium subscription.  
5. Sharing the continued news coverage of these events.  
6. Encouraging others to do all the above.

On July 1st, a highly unpopular [change to Reddit's API pricing](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/) went into effect. [Most third-party apps have shut down](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23779519/reddit-third-party-app-shut-down-apollo-sync-baconreader-api-protest) and so have many tools relied upon by moderators and [projects for making Reddit more accessible to visually impaired users](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/comments/14ggf8k/the_future_of_transcribers_of_reddit/). 

Beyond the [disastrous AMA](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/09/reddit-ceo-doubles-down-on-attack-on-apollo-developer-in-drama-filled-ama/) by the CEO, Reddit's response has been limited to promises that this change will not affect moderation tools [^((it has)^)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BotDefense/comments/14riw76/botdefense_is_wrapping_up_operations/) and promises of [new and more-accessible first-party moderation tools](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/01/1184258201/reddit-api-accessibility-mods). Promises just like [ones they have made in response to past protests](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/142w159/askhistorians_and_uncertainty_surrounding_the/), but have consistently [failed to fulfill](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/14jm3ut/several_communities_have_surfaced_an_open_letter/jpm9e0q/). 

If you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:

1. [Finding your favorite subreddits on other platforms](https://sub.rehab/) and participating there instead.  
2. Refraining from using the first-party Reddit app, instead sticking to one of the few remaining third-party apps or [patching one of the apps that shut down](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1wHvqQwCYdJrQg4BKlGIVDLksPN0KpOnJWniT6PbZSrI/) if you're using an Android device.  
3. Disabling ads on Reddit with [an ad-blocking extension](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin-ubo) or [a DNS-based ad-blocker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBXTnrD_Zs4).  
4. Cancelling your Reddit Premium subscription.  
5. Sharing the continued news coverage of these events.  
6. Encouraging others to do all the above.

Reddit’s recent actions to add unreasonable API pricing to 3rd party Reddit apps is extremely disappointing. Many users and moderators alike use these apps daily to interact with Reddit. Reddit continues to make changes to its platforms without consideration of the difficulties it adds to the way users interact with the site. We hope that they change course and find a way to have this end in a positive outcome for all parties involved, instead of further spiraling in the current direction.

"You OK, Kid?","So, here's a bit of background for this post. I recently got back into RimWorld, and was enjoying some base building. I'd installed a few mods, mostly to get back some old characters of mine. I hadn't even intended on going against the Empire this time, since that generally seemed like a waste of time, and ill-advised. One of my pawns even had an imperial title at this point, which is something I rarely pursue.  
  
Anyway, we'd done a few jobs for the empire, including fighting like, 3 mechanoid hives for some plasteel. Lo and behold, the message for a deserter shows up. Normally, I'd be ignoring it since perma-agroing the empire would be a bad idea for me. Then I started reading some information about the deserter in question.  
  
She was 14, defecting from the empire. I read her child (only) backstory, and my heart sank. I also have Speak Up! as one of my mods, and it just so happens that my colony's leader, Captain, said a quote about being glad to have helped so many people on the Rim. It really wasn't much of a decision at that point.  
  
Captain is actually the one on the right, severely injured. He took on 3 jannisaries by himself until my ranger could get from one end of the map to the other to help out. He had like 20% health and about 14 gunshot wounds (thankfully none of them permanent) by the time they managed to fight the empire off. Honestly, I'm kind of glad this little deserter showed up, because I had been wondering just what was my goal with this run... Now I think I have a good idea."

Thoughts?,"As I said on the post about this a couple days ago, if they wanted to do the Dumbledore and Grindelwald story, they should have just done that, not making it a part of the Fantastic Beasts one. That should have just been for Newt and his creatures.

Besides, I remember back when they first announced Fantastic Beasts people were more confused about why they had chosen that to spin off. Most people weren't familiar with Newt. But they knew Dumbledore, and I have no doubt that if they had started with a young Dumbledore film the series would have been a lot more successful than it was.

Include Newt as a student of his and then do a Fantastic Beasts film after that if he was popular enough. But starting with him, and then trying to do a weird hook turn into the Grindelwald story was just a baffling decision."

Another Hard Drive W,"PSA: Make it a habit of **reading the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gamingcirclejerk/about/rules)** of each subreddit you participate in:

**Rule 9: No Offensive Imagery**: *This includes nazi imagery and slurs, for you brave nerds who think ""free speech"" involves private internet forums. If you post fascist iconography trying to “jerk”, you will receive a ban. The only exception is when we make fun of gamers and criticize gamers who happen to be fascists. Please remember to spoiler any potentially triggering or offensive content accordingly. This rule now includes repeatedly posting bigotry from the same source (4chan).*

**Rule 7: No Participation in Linked Threads (Brigading)**: *If you are coming here to brigade this sub, you will be banned. Likewise, do not make comments and vote in pages you've found here. Of course, if you're a member of said sub and you were already in the thread before, this doesn't apply to you.*

**Rule 8: Censor Screenshots**: *Keep screenshots of arguments on Reddit to a minimum. Please remember to censor screenshots of all identifying information, i.e usernames* **and** *subreddit names. This applies to screenshots from any social media sites.*

**Rule 11: Keep Posts Relevant (only about Don Cheadle)**: *This is first and foremost a place to make fun of gamers. Just because someone is being a bigot online doesn't mean it belongs here. Let them be pathetic without infecting the sub with their nonsense. Please avoid posting screenshots that show people using capital G gamer slurs.* **If absolutely necessary, please censor posts and the words containing such content.**

**Rule 12: No Fake Posts on Other Subs (Contamination)**: *Do not create fake posts on other subs only to post back here. Also, do not ""lol, you should post this on r / OtherSub"". It's considered interfering with their content and can also lead to brigading.*

*This is a reminder to the readers. The post itself is untouched.*

What's your worst tinder date?,"I am 40M and was was dating dating a lot at the time and this was by far the weirdest one. This happened back in the Spring 2022

The match started normal enough though she was a bit young for me at 28.  Her pictures were nice. She said she was still in school and working in investing and finance. She asked to get drinks after only a handful of messages,  which I thought was odd but why not.

When I show up I am immediately taken back by what she is wearing. She is decked out in very fancy men's clothes like someone going to a cocktail party with old money British people.  I later find out the tie she is wearing costs a few hundred from a boutique London store. But this is NYC and a lot of people are eccentric and I think maybe this is just a look she is trying out.

I could roll with the outfit but when I heard her voice I was floored. She started by saying ""Well, Hello there"" in kind of an old timey accent. She spoke like she was SNL' s Kate McKinnon doing an impression of someone.  Now I am thinking to myself ""wtf is this?""

I am polite so I go along with it like this is normal. We starting talking about work and she starts telling me that she just got off work at her job at the 'Running Shoe Store', I was confused because I thought she did finance  but she explains that she is trying to get a job doing that and right now she is working at the running store.  She mentions how everyone there thinks she is a manager because of the way she dresses. In my head, ""she wears the fancy clothes to a job at the running store, wtf""

I casually ask if she likes running and she responds that she absolutely hates running. She also hates sneakers and they don't fit on her feet. She only wears a particular type of mens dress shoes.

At this point I think I am being punked. I start looking around trying to find where the camera is. I can't believe that this could possible be real.

Then she mentions that I am a little young for her. I ask her what she means because I am a lot older than her. She then tells me that her last bf was 78 and the one before that was 85. She is looking for younger guys now because she wants to have a long term relationship and then in a Groucho Marx  voice says ""If you know what I mean"" .

I am now looking at the other people at the bar trying to figure out if they are actors but they all seem normal.

It goes on for a bit longer with some other weirdness.  At this point it was just a car accident and I can't stop watching. I wouldn't be surprised if there was Youtube channel out there with this."

On July 1st, a highly unpopular [change to Reddit's API pricing](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/) went into effect. [Most third-party apps have shut down](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23779519/reddit-third-party-app-shut-down-apollo-sync-baconreader-api-protest) and so have many tools relied upon by moderators and [projects for making Reddit more accessible to visually impaired users](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/comments/14ggf8k/the_future_of_transcribers_of_reddit/). 

Beyond the [disastrous AMA](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/09/reddit-ceo-doubles-down-on-attack-on-apollo-developer-in-drama-filled-ama/) by the CEO, Reddit's response has been limited to promises that this change will not affect moderation tools [^((it has)^)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BotDefense/comments/14riw76/botdefense_is_wrapping_up_operations/) and promises of [new and more-accessible first-party moderation tools](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/01/1184258201/reddit-api-accessibility-mods). Promises just like [ones they have made in response to past protests](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/142w159/askhistorians_and_uncertainty_surrounding_the/), but have consistently [failed to fulfill](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/14jm3ut/several_communities_have_surfaced_an_open_letter/jpm9e0q/). 

If you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:

1. [Finding your favorite subreddits on other platforms](https://sub.rehab/) and participating there instead.  
2. Refraining from using the first-party Reddit app, instead sticking to one of the few remaining third-party apps or [patching one of the apps that shut down](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1wHvqQwCYdJrQg4BKlGIVDLksPN0KpOnJWniT6PbZSrI/) if you're using an Android device.  
3. Disabling ads on Reddit with [an ad-blocking extension](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin-ubo) or [a DNS-based ad-blocker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBXTnrD_Zs4).  
4. Cancelling your Reddit Premium subscription.  
5. Sharing the continued news coverage of these events.  
6. Encouraging others to do all the above.

Do you think these two ever... you know..?,Most recognisable Kim cosplay
A former 343 Employee states the development team heard about ‘Hunt the Truth’ the same time that fans did.,"I get why they did hunt the truth.

They didn’t want to spoil the plot for Cortana coming back, so they focused the marketing on Locke hunting Chief instead. That was probably the only way they could think to advertise the story without spoiling it. 

The problem is that Chief being hunted was infinitely more interesting than Cortana coming back and turning evil.

It’s not uncommon to focus on a smaller part of the story for marketing to avoid spoiling the main plot. But, if that smaller part is more interesting than the main plot, you’re setting people up for disappointment."

"Women can’t be software engineers, apparently","As you're all aware, this subreddit has had a major ""troll"" 
problem which has gotten worse (as of recently). Due to this, we 
have created new rules, and modified some of the old ones.

We kindly ask that you please familiarize yourself with the 
rules so that you can avoid breaking them. Breaking mild rules 
will result in a warning, or a temporary ban. Breaking serious 
rules, or breaking a plethora of mild ones may land you a 
permanent ban (depending on the severity). Also, 
grifting/lurking has been a major problem; If we suspect you of 
being a grifter (determined by vetting said user's activity), we 
may ban you without warning.

You may attempt an appeal via ModMail, but please be advised not 
to use rude, harassing, foul, or passive-aggressive language 
towards the moderators, _or_ complain to moderators about why we 
have specific rules in the first place— You will be ignored, and 
your ban will remain (without even a consideration). 

All rules are made public; ""Lack of knowledge"" or ""ignorance of 
the rules"" cannot or will not be a viable excuse if you end up 
banned for breaking them (This applies to the Subreddit rules, 
and Reddit's ToS). **Again: All rules are made public, and 
Reddit gives you the option to review the rules once more before 
submitting a post, it is your choice if you choose to read them 
or not, but breaking them will not be acceptable.**

With that being said, If you send a mature, neutral message 
regarding questions about a current ban, or a ban appeal 
(without ""not knowing the rules"" as an excuse), we will 
elaborate about why you were banned, or determine/consider if we 
will shorten, lift, keep it, _or_ extended it/make it permanent. 
This all means that appeals are discretionary, and your 
reasoning for wanting an appeal must be practical and valid.

Thank you all so much for taking the time to read this message, 
and please enjoy your day!

Fuel services not guaranteed.,"Based on some leaks, only 10 stations have the ability to refuel, and it's quite likely most of those will be locked to the controlling gangs, so in reality any person might only have 2-3 stations to refuel at across the whole system, given you'll likely be soft locked to a single gang. Also, a gang's stations are likely to be close to one another, so it's not unlikely you'll only be able to refuel say in the most central planets, and therefore you'll need refuelling ships to access the outer planets.

My husband doesn’t know how to be poor,"This post has been flaired as “Vent”.  As a reminder to commenting users, “Vent/Rant” posts are here to give our subscribers a safe place to vent their frustrations at an uncaring world to a supportive place of people who “get it”.  Vents do not need to be fair.  They do not need to be articulate.  They do not need to be factual.  They just need to be honest.

Unlike most of the content on this subreddit, Vents should not be considered advice threads.  In most cases it is not appropriate to try to give the Submitter advice on their issue.  In no circumstances is it appropriate to tell them “why they are wrong” or to criticise them, their decisions, values, or anything else.  If there are aspects of their situation that they are able to directly address themselves, the submitter can always make a new thread with a different flair asking for help once they are ready to tackle the issue.

Vents are an emotional outlet, not an academic conversation.  Appropriate replies in these threads are offering support, sharing similar experiences/grievances, offering condolences, or simply letting the Submitter know that they were heard.

As always, if there are inappropriate comments please downvote them, REPORT them to the mods, and move on without responding to them.

To the Submitter, if you DO want discussion to be focused on resolving your situation, rather than supporting you emotionally, please change the flair of this post, and then report this comment so we can remove it.  Thank you.
Thank you all for being a part of this great financial advice and emotional support community!

3. Refrain from provoking and/or baiting religious fruitcakes for the purposes of posting their reaction on this subreddit, or posting material featuring provocation by others.

Why do all new houses that are built in the last 20 years all look something similar to this?, Because they are volume builds. Big builders have a couple of styles to choose from. They enjoy economies of scale to just build the same design. If someone wants a new build that is unique they need to use an architect.
Throwback to when some senior R* devs/designers came to visit my university (two days after the gameplay leak),"We were told that we couldn't ask them anything about the gameplay video leak.

Night City is far bigger in the Lore than it is in game. Still a lot of untapped potential for a sequel in NC.,"That's a map circa 2045, which is very different from the state of the city in 2077.  Some of those areas seemingly don't exist anymore.  But I do like looking at the various older maps of the city to see what’s changed. 

There's already plenty of untapped potential with the current size of the in-game map.  I would like them to make parts of the city feel denser and more packed like Dogtown and Watson.  There's just too much emptiness in some districts.

But the city won't be the same for the sequel.  I imagine there’ll be some familiar parts but time will have passed and in-game lore crumbs and The Tower ending alludes to changes in the future.  

There's also the shift to Unreal Engine 5.  Plus they're going to work hard to top the current iteration of the city to make it even more flashy and impressive for the big sequel."

How good was Brave New World?,"

I teach the California State University’s Expository Reading and Writing Course (ERWC) to high school Seniors, and I have read and taught *Brave New World* seven times in the past four years as a part of it…

One of the activities in the ERWC module for *Brave New World* asks students to read an excerpt from the foreword to American author/cultural critic/educator/media theorist Neil Postman’s 1985 book *Amusing Ourselves to Death*,  in which he states that ""What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy. As Huxley remarked in *Brave New World Revisited*, the civil libertarians and rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny 'failed to take into account man’s almost infinite appetite for distractions.' In *1984*, Huxley added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In *Brave New World*, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell feared that what we hate will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we love will ruin us.""

When I get a little cynical about my position in the public school education system and think about the fact that a significant number of Americans never read another book after graduating from high school — the majority of Americans read only four books a year, according to a survey by the Pew Research Center — and reflect upon how teenagers (at least the ones with whom I interact) seem to engage with the information and the media that they consume, I sometimes find myself agreeing with Postman that Huxley’s vision of a dystopian future may be coming true…"
