Why does my cat keep patting my face?,"This is one way cats show affection or try to get your attention. Not all cats do this, however, but they might show this in other ways such as as kneading, gentle scratching and gifting etc. Cats also show affection to other animals by rubbing against them ""When your cat puts its scent on you, it's saying something like, 'You and I belong together because I smell you on me and you smell me on you.' It's a scent complement."" Some cats periodically approach a relaxed owner and stretch out their paws to softly touch the owner's face. The cat repeats this gentle reaching in the hope that the owner will pet it, brush it or show some affection. Alternatively, some cats paw their owner's face to wake them from sleep; in this case the cat probably wants affection or play."
How should I discipline my cat for bad behavior?,"Punishment rarely works because cats don't have a social structure that recognizes you as the dominant being in the home, they only understand that you're doing something to them that they don't want (squirting them with water, for example). Therefore, it's much more effective to figure out why your cat is exhibiting the undesireable behavior and meet those needs in a way that is acceptable to both of you rather than punishing the cat for the undesireable behavior.  Usually, cats climb on countertops because they have instincts telling them to climb (better view, hiding from predators/prey, etc).  To keep them from the kitchen countertops, you should install cat wall shelves and/or cat trees to give them that height advantage that they are looking for. Sometimes it's hard to find space for these things in the kitchen, but even devoting a corner to a set of shelves so they can watch you cook can be helpful! (They also may be climbing on the countertops if you leave dirty dishes out that they can scrounge for food from, so housekeeping is important!). I'm not familiar with dog/cat interactions, so it's difficult for me to give advice there. We do have a cat who's much younger than the other cats and often would harass them because he had a lot of energy and wanted to play. I started making SURE that I spent 30-60 minutes a day playing with him with wand toys to tire him out, and he is now much less bothersome to the older cats.  "
How can I fix my relationship with my 7 month old cat after I've constantly abused her the past month?,"As in human cases of abuse, if you genuinely want to repair the relationship, the first and most essential thing to accept is you may not be able to. Especially with a young kitten, it's entirely possible you've scarred her for life. Even if she can recover in general, she may never be able to respond to you without fear.  The second most essential thing is the need for accountability. You know now that you are a person capable of abusing a kitten. You don't have the luxury anymore of assuming you will just not do those things. You need to involve at least one person that can hold you to account. I would honestly recommend that you give her to someone else who does not live with you. Give her a clean break and allow her to re-establish trust with an uninvolved human being. If this person reports to you that she's stabilized emotionally and acting like a normal cat towards them, then you can attempt a supervised visit with her. Do not push interaction on her - you should treat her like a feral cat, at maximum extend a hand and invite her towards you. Do not approach her or take any action that could conceivably be considered threatening. Accept that it could take numerous repeats of this before she is willing to approach. If after several tries of this you see no improvement, or if the person caring for her reports that she backslides significantly after your visits, refer to point 1: it may be a hopeless case where you are concerned. Accept this and let her go. If she begins to warm back up to you, however, you could consider taking her back only if the following conditions are met: Recovering from being an abuser is possible (especially as you're still young), but it is a very serious matter and you cannot treat any part of this lightly. It is vitally important that you address the original abuse and commit to changing anything and everything that contributed to your behaviour. Do not accept responsibility for any animal until point 2 has been satisfactorily achieved, and even then, tread with caution. People criminally charged with animal abuse can be legally barred from owning animals again in the future; in the end this may be the sentence you have to impose on yourself."
How much purring is too much purring?,"Cats purr, as well as meow to communicate. Purring doesn't always mean the cat is happy. It's a type of language for the cat. There has been research into the way cats communicate with their owners and how the different types of meows and purrs evoke reactions in their owners, ultimately helping the cat to communicate her needs and wants and getting them met. The pitch of the sound will evoke certain emotional responses within cat owners to express whether the cat's needs are urgent or a signal of being contented. (1)(2) Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP) is also known as the purring disease; is an illness that can be fatal to cats and one of the features is that the cat will continue to purr up until the moment of death or last consciousness before death. The purring may also be more noticeable due to chronic airway congestion. (3)(4) I don't believe that there would be an upper limit in a healthy cat. Some cats will be more inclined to purr more than others, for more reasons than are practical to list here. If your cat is not drooling when she purrs, has bad breath, difficulty breathing or sounds congested, does not have any erratic behavior, it would most likely be safe to say your cat is healthy. Interestingly, there is some research into cat's purring and links to the purrs increasing the pet owners health due to the frequency of a cat's purr resonating with the human body. It suggests a form of entrainment that is similar to the effects of soothing music on the body that is discussed here  Does music affect heart-rate?.

"What is this street cat asking for, with continuous meowing?","If she's not satisfied with food/drink it may be that she is actually seeking nothing more than attention. Adult cats don't meow to each other (in cat-world it's only used to communicate between mothers and kittens) so she's definitely trying to say something to you. As to what, well that's a bit harder to be sure on (sadly there's no cat-translator yet) as a rough meow-vocabulary usually develops between a cat and it's slave-human. In general terms though you can get a rough idea from the pitch and duration of the meow: One or two short meows = A standard ""greeting"" meow, the cat equivalent of ""Hi"" Multiple meows, especially if accompanied by a vertical tail = Excited greeting. e.g. “Great to see You!” often there's a subtext of ""Have you got any food handy?"" Or ""Give me some fuss"" as well. Mid-pitch meow = Polite request for something, “I'd like to eat.” or ""Play with me"" or ""Fuss me!"" Longer, more drawn-out mrrroooow = Demand for something, often an escalation of the ""Polite Request"" e.g. “Open the door. NOW.” or ""Feed me puny Human!"" Low-pitch MRRRooooowww = Complaint of a wrong you have done. e.g. “You still haven't fed me!” or ""The litter tray is full of poop and I need to go"" or ""You're ignoring me and it's making me cross!"" etc. High-pitched, relatively loud RRRROWW! = Anger or pain. e.g. ""You just stepped on my tail you oaf!"" Hiss = Aggression e.g. ""Go away!"" Or ""Don't mess with me or I'll totally claw your face off!"" Hissing is used cat-to-cat as is growling as well as to humans. BRRRUPP! = ""Excuse me, coming through!"" PRRRIP! = General happy noise Chirping/Chittering = Mild frustration e.g. ""I can't reach it (the prey/toy)"" Multiple ""Yowl!"" Sounds = ""I'm in heat"" Low-pitched growl = ""This food/toy/blanket/whatever is MINE, don't come near!"" From how you describe it I think this is likely a plea for fuss or attention, and as @Mick mentions in his comment you probably want to consider carefully before going ahead as the cat may be looking to bond with you and if you aren't prepared to reciprocate then it may be inadvisable to encourage her. Vocalisations do vary from cat to cat, some don't even ""talk"" at all. The nuances of an individual cats ""speech"" are something that an owner gets used to over time. That said there is substantial overlap across many cats in general terms and the list here is intended as a rough starting point for people like the OP who don't have any history with the cat they are trying to understand, it's not always going to be right but it's better than nothing."
Who should win at tug of war?,"This answer is not correct. If you have a dominance problem with the dog (which MANY people do) letting the dog win will just exacerbate the aggression displayed by your dog. The act of playing is a release of energy and aggression, so I don't agree that you need to let the dog win in all circumstances.  Personally I don't let my dog win at tug-of-war, and she isn't the least bit less interested in playing because of this. That being said, I have trained some very timid dogs, and it is beneficial to them to win at tug-of-war, as it increases their confidence. As with many other things, one answer is not suitable for all dogs. Edit: Let them win: Don't let them win: Depends (there are a lot of these, I left most of them out): Now, I'm not asserting that all of these sources are credible by any means, but it gives you an idea that the problem is hardly ""solved""."
Can cats safely eat raw meat?,"You can feed cats raw meat, they're obligate carnivores after all, but human processed meats can introduce other bacterias and contaminates into meat that might not be there otherwise. If you want to do this, which I can understand, then you should introduce the raw meats carefully into their diet and only from a source that you trust, such as local butcher who is following good practices (if they save bones for dogs, it's probably a good sign).  While you're doing this, monitor your cat carefully and if there is anything happening that concerns you such as unusual stool, vomiting, etc. then stop immediately and potentially take him/her into a vet for a check up. As an aside, there are some really good food products for cats that don't have as much (or little) filling in them. Spend some time reading the labels and look for products that are all meat or very, very high meat volume. Your cats will appreciate it. :)"
What causes a dog to lunge at an unknown child and how should the owner respond?,"Distraction, via food, voice or otherwise, is usually a good way of managing in the short term but in my personal view it can take quite some time before the dog gets the connection if you're using distraction alone and relying on things to happen (i.e. whenever a child happens to pass by). Another short term technique to can be of help is finding an incompatible behaviour, i.e. one that, if he performs that behaviour, he can't exhibit the problem behaviour at the same time. In your case, for example, you might ask your dog to sit and to watch you. Both behaviours are incompatible with lunging, i.e. it can't lunge and sit at the same time. But you'll have to ensure his motivation to keep sitting is higher than his fear of the child. So get not just your average treats but very, very special super yummy sausages, steak, whatever he likes most. This is different from simple distraction, as you are asking your dog to actively do stuff and he knows that lunging at children will mean losing out on the reward he knows he's getting if he just keeps still that little bit longer. The long term solution is what's called desensitization and counter-conditioning. In short, it means gradually getting your dog used to whatever triggers the fear reaction (and it is fear 99% of the time rather than aggression) while at the same time associating the trigger with positive outcomes. Practically, it means you'll want to recruit someone's child to help you, since children seem to be the trigger. The main thing to do is to make this training exercise safe for the child, your dog and yourself, so ideally set it up with a fence between the dog and the child, so the dog can't get at the child even if you lose control of the leash. Find the distance at which your dog is still comfortable with the child, i.e. well before it starts lunging or showing any other warning signals (growling, raised heckles, etc.). While you are at a comfortable distance, whenever the dog looks over to the child, reward it with lots of praise and food (or a toy, if that's what motivates your dog). Really hammer it home that good things happen when it looks at the child and doesn't react. The best way to do this (if your dog is food motivated) is to give him a special type of treat, the nicest you can find, that he only gets when he is around children and behaves himself. Don't use this type of treat for anything else! Once your dog is happy with the child at a certain distance and realises good things happen with the child around, move a step closer. Really go slowly, as getting it wrong will undo a lot of work up to that point. When you do get it wrong and your dog reacts to the child, lead it away to a safe distance and start again. Don't punish the dog! You're the one who pushed it too quickly into a situation the dog is not comfortable with. Simply go back to a distance the dog is OK with and start again. Do this for 5-10 minutes, then wait until the next day. Gradually build up your dog's resistance to children and slowly associate them as being good for it. Keep in mind that this might be a long and slow process for the simple reason that when you're actually out on a walk and your dog is forced into a situation it's not comfortable with (children have the unfortunate tendency of wanting to pet even the most fearsome and aggressive looking dogs) and it lunges, the kid will probably run away, meaning the dog's response just got reinforced and you have to undo that again. Dog is scared of kid, dog lunges, kid runs away => dog achieves desired outcome."
Overly friendly stray cat wants to come in our house,"Thank you for your concern for the little homeless kitty. While it's very likely the cat has fleas and intestinal parasites, the good news is cat fleas do not feed on humans. I used to rescue dirty, sad, abandoned cats and never once was bitten by a flea or any other skin parasite. Treating the fleas is best done with a medicine applied to the back of the neck in my opinion. Advantage II is an example of this. These can be pricey at around $40 or $50. The flea collars are cheaper but be aware you cat will be wearing a potent poison around its neck. This is not good for cats, people who pet them, or babies in the house. If you go the flea collar route, just keep the cat away from the baby and wash your hands after handling the cat. Naturally, don't touch the collar. The fleas are not good for the cat, but it is unlikely they will cause your cat any serious harm if you have to wait a while before treating the fleas. If you just want to clean the cat up, Vet's Best No-Rinse Clean Waterless Cat Shampoo is about $5 on Amazon and very easy to use, and involves no potentially traumatic (for both owner and cat) baths in the sink. The alternative to declawing is manually clipping your cat's nails. This requires some finesse, technique, and getting your cat used to the process, but it is not too difficult. There are also glue-one cat nail covers (think fake nails for cats), but they are a costlier solution. As far as the cat's eyes go, what you describe sounds like an eye infection. These are very common in strays and feral cats. You can try gently dabbing the eyes with a moistened cotton ball to remove any liquids or dried-on exudate. If the liquid is yellowish, greenish, or brownish, it may be a bacterial infection. This may clear up on its own or may require a topical antibiotic ointment.  A good vet will get you a broad spectrum ointment without you having to make a more costly office visit. Also, some stores will sell animal antibiotics over the counter. Terramycin is a good one. Do not use antibiotics sold for human use on a cat. One thing to keep in mind is while you may not be able to perfectly care for the cat, and your baby may be a little rough with the cat, the cat will be much better off just living in your house, under your care and protection, getting regular meals.  The average life expectancy for a feral cat is about 4 years. Under your care she can live 4 or 5 times this or more."
"Is this normal first day home behavior for my kitten, or should I be concerned?","This seems pretty standard for a kitten that was separated from her mother and siblings maybe a bit too young. 6 weeks old used to be the standard age to send kittens to new homes, and it won't hurt your kitten long-term, but it can produce this sort of mourning period. These days, 8 weeks old is the recommended age for re-homing, after they are independently on solid food and independently using a litter box.  Obviously, there's nothing you can do about it now, and you didn't know beforehand, so there's no use in worrying about an early separation. Instead, watch the kitten closely and be as hands-on as possible. Snuggling and petting will help her adjust to you. You can put hot water in an old soda-pop bottle (or any other container) and wrap it in a towel for her to snuggle with. Make sure that the food you're offering her is the same as the food that she was getting before, and make sure that it's very close by to the nest she has made with the blanket. You might also try hand feeding her a few bites to pique her interest. See if you can get her to drink a little water. You might even dip your finger in water and then gently put it in her mouth a few times. Make sure that she is using the litterbox. If you think she hasn't peed or pooped in the last 24 hours, you should stimulate her by gently rubbing a damp, warm washcloth over her abdomen. Her mother used to do this with her tongue when the kittens were younger, and although a 6-week-old should be able to do her business by herself, she might be having some difficulty. If more than 48 hours pass without her eating, drinking, or passing waste, take her to the vet right away. But it will likely not get to that. Best of luck!"
Is blinking slowly at cats a way to tell them that you love them?,"In the Manual of Clinical Behavioral Medicine for Dogs and Cats, Karen Overall describes the slow blinking motion of a cats eyes as a sign of a fully relaxed cat. If a human is mimicking that action, the message they're potentially sending to the cat is that they're, themselves, relaxed and so trusting in the presence the cat. That consequence of that, in turn, may be to further relax the cat which then causes a similar response as well as, possibly, a soft purr. Basically a whole lot of contentment all around. If nothing else, the ability of any animal to be fully relaxed and comfortable in the presence of a human is a sign of trust and confidence and that's as much a sign of love as anything else we could choose to take. So, I think you're both right. :D"
Does purring tire cats?,"Purring is a sign of wellbeing for the house cat. She certainly purrs because you are petting her, but if she would be sleeping on you then chances are she would probably also be purring without you touching her. Imagine this. When you pet her it's sort of like when you get a massage. You might fall asleep or you might drift off a little bit. Your cat is the same. Petting her for 15 minutes if she's purring the whole time is equivalent to her being completely relaxed. It is only natural for her to fall asleep. If she is tired of the petting and want you to stop, she would just move or show you by play-attacking you. Cats can stop purring immediately if something makes them uncomfortable. Edit:
Like @Ross Presser mentioned, cats can purr while in pain, but this does not mean you should ever be alarmed when your cat purrs. However, it is important to check in on your cat and keep an eye on how they are doing. If they show any other new strange behaviour or react in a negative way combined with the purring, then a good suggestion would be to have a check-up at the vet."
"How do I ""apologise"" to my cat?","I wouldn’t start giving treats for small accidents - what kind of behavior are you trying to reinforce? The cat won’t understand the concept of an “apology” via treats. And if careless weaving results in treats, kitty may end up with receiving more kicks trying to elicit treats from the human who is stumbling to the bathroom at night. My preferred way to apologize is to show affection, e.g. a quick scratch behind the ears, “fussing” a bit, something like that, then continue as if nothing happened. The less drama you make out of the situation, the less reinforcement of “something bad happened” in the cat."
How do I give a cat a pill?,"Update : Zaralynda's answer below contains very important advice I wasn't aware of when writing this answer.  To summarize, you must make your cat drink water after pilling him/her, or s/he may suffer esophagus damage.  I believe the best is to wait for the cat to be thirsty or hungry before pilling him/her. After about one month of daily giving several pills to my cat, I managed to find the process not so difficult after all.  Only one person (with two arms) is required. First, firmly catch your cat by the neck's skin with your left hand (mirror this howto if your left-handed), where it is insensitive (you know, just as the cat mother catch them with her jaws to move them), while he's still on the ground.  You don't want him to be too uncomfortable, so if you feel your hand is not at the right place, move it until you find the right spot.
Edit : be cautious with this technique.  You may prefer alternative ways of handling your cat (like the towel technique, handling your cat with your arm under his throat, or help from a second person), especially if s/he is old, fat or becomes aggressive.  However I feel in most cases this technique is the most appropriate for pilling a reluctant cat.
Edit2 : I tried several times to handle the cat without scruffing him, but the results were always terrible and most of the times I ended up scruffing him anyway.  I feel it's much more comfortable for the cat to be scruffed during 15 seconds (actually less than 5 seconds when you're used to it and everything goes well) than to be gently tortured during 5 minutes or more. Then, bring his neck up so that he's on his back paws. Take the pill between the thumb and the forefinger of your right hand. Use your middle finger (or others if you find it easier) both to open his jaws and to keep his muzzle up.  (Now that our cat is used to this procedure, I find the opening of the jaws the most difficult part of the whole procedure, as he won't open his mouth willingly — in particular after the first pill…)  Once the jaws are open and the muzzle up, release the pill, aiming at the oesophagus.  You may have to wait for the cat to flatten his tongue before.  Finally, and it took me a while (and many many spitted pills) to figure this out, the key is to keep the cat muzzle up until he swallows.  This reduces drastically the spitting (thanks to gravity, I guess).  On a side note, actually I managed to give my cat a pill yesterday while he was laying comfortably, without steps 1 & 2, just by ensuring his muzzle stayed up. Caress his chest and release him.  Make sure he drinks something to help the pill get into the stomach (see Zaralynda's answer below).  If he doesn't, use a syringe to force him. Of course the cat may still spit sometimes, but just take the pill back and try again. Tip : if you have several pills, have them ready and don't release the cat until you're done. PS : I didn't invent anything, it's the way my vet taught me."
Can I rename a dog I get from a shelter?,"It doesn't really matter. It's a training thing. You can make the dog respond to either name it might just take some time, especially for older dogs. We adopted our second dog from a shelter and he was so conditioned on his name that he'd cower in fear hearing it, so changing it was not a question. If you think about it, training a new name is basically just training a new command/word for ""hey, attention""."
My cat is not eating or drinking anything after the death of the fellow cat,"If a cat isn't eating it's always time for the veterinarian! As Trond points out, make sure he is drinking water. And until you can see a vet keep the cat properly warm (not hot, but make sure he isn't cold). This could be a disease he caught from the other cat, or it could be a severe case of grief, but when a cat isn't eating veterinary intervention is needed urgently! EDIT: Since a vet has (hopefully) ruled out diseases it's time to go into caregiver mode. I'd try the following, roughly in order, until the cat is eating again: Wet food, first in a bowl, then trying to get him to lick it off your finger, make sure to try both chunks in gravy, and the pasty stuff. Treats, either hand fed, or mixed in wet or dry food. Try warming the wet food in the microwave, to make it more smelly. Fed in bowl, or by hand. Chicken (careful not to include bones), or cooked fish. Tuna, but make sure it's high quality, and never more than a little. It smells really good to cats, and I've never met a cat who will refuse it. But it does contain some traces of mercury, which will build up in the body and could cause issues in larger amounts. If none of the above works, it may be time to look into force feeding, I'd get back in touch with the vet to get instructions on how to do this, and with what. It is also important during all of this to give your cat extra attention, lots of cuddles, maybe having him in your lap on a warm blanket whenever your lap is available. And trying to get back to normal by playing with him. "
How to introduce my aggressive dog to other canines?,"I would really urge you to see a professional dog trainer that you trust, with experience with aggressive dogs, and have him assess your dogs and help you out. But after reading a bit more detail about your situation here than what you gave in another question on why he lunges at children, I'll take a guess at your dog's previous history, which might go some way towards explaining its current behaviour, and I'll try to give you some pointers as to what you can do to improve the situation. Dogs, by their very nature as social animals, are very non-confrontational. Because they possess very many very sharp teeth, they have evolved a multitude of warning signals that let other dogs know what they are up to*.  **Which is why cats, which are solitary predators, never let you know before they scratch you. Giving away your intentions is dangerous if every interaction with another member from your species is a potential fight.* Dogs will look away, lick their lips, turn their heads, pretend to sniff and present the side of their bodies in order to calm other dogs down. If that doesn't work, they start staring you down, raising their heckles, baring their teeth, snarl, growl, bark and snap at you, all in order to get you to chill the heck out. Only if none of these signals work will they start biting, and even then it's usually just a quick nip. However, many of those behaviours are seen as problem behaviours. Many people with a dog that has associated other dogs and people with bad things happening, and therefore constantly growls, lunges and barks at them, will punish the dog for these behaviours. Unfortunately, the dog will fail to pick up on the reason for being punished in most circumstances. Instead, his association of dogs/people and bad things happening will grow but he will start to suppress one warning signal after another until he goes straight for the bite. I'm suspecting this is what happened to your dog and, depending on how much this has been trained out of him, he could be quite difficult to rehabilitate. Given his history, he probably isn't safe to be off leash around other dogs at this particular time. The main problem is that, if another dog does anything to upset him, he won't let the other dog know that he's not okay with it but go straight on the attack. Your main technique for dealing with this issue, as with the lunging at children, is desensitisation. Slowly introduce him to other dogs in a manner that he is comfortable with. If that means the other dog has to stay twenty metres away, then so be it. Reward your dog every time he shows interest in another dog (i.e. looks at him) with lots of treats and praise. Be very quick in your reactions, you want to reward him for looking and before he starts deciding whether that dog poses a threat or not. Try to set him up for success as much as possible. Every time you judge his comfort zone wrong, he'll regress far more than the progress he gets from one good association. If your dog does react badly and starts lunging/barking, try to distract him any way you can but without anything negative, otherwise it'll simply reinforce his bad associations with other dogs. For example, try to get his attention with treats and calling his name in a really exaggerated high pitch, happy voice but only reward him after you've asked him to do something, e.g. sit or watch. If you can't distract him at all, lead him away to a distance he is comfortable with, which will likely be around the corner and out of sight of the other dog.  One thing you can do to let him know that you don't want him to do something is to introduce a no reward marker, i.e. a command that the dog associates with losing out on a reward. This can be a simple ""oh, oh"" or ""oh no"" in a disappointed voice, rather than the stern ""ah ah!"" or ""no!"" you'd use as a verbal correction. Once you have a no reward marker trained in (see below), you can use it to correct bad behaviour without forming bad associations. It won't be enough to stop him barking at other dogs, but if you're trying to distract him with a sit, and he keeps getting up and turning around, it might just make him more likely to listen to you.   In order to train in a no reward marker, you need to set your dog up to fail. This seems opposite to what I've said above, but he will only be failing some of the time. Ideally, get some treats that your dog loves but that you can eat as well. Cheese cubes or hot dogs work great, assuming you're not vegan or lactose-intolerant. Try and find a situation where you ask your dog to do something and you know he will fail a few times. Training in a new command is a good candidate for this. If your dog is a jumper, stopping him jumping up is even better. Taking that last example as a case study, with the dog sitting in front of you, hold a treat above your head and slowly lower it down towards the dog. Depending on how jumpy your dog is, only lower the treat a little bit before reaching down to it very quickly and rewarding him. The goal is to judge the distance at which your dog jumps and, normally, to reward it before reaching that threshold. You slowly set that threshold closer and closer to the dog's face, until it won't jump up at all and waits for you to give it the treat. Now, your typical jumpy dog will break its sit and jump up. In this case, quickly pull the treat back up out of its reach and mark that loss of a reward with an ""oh oh"". That way, your dog will begin to associate the command with not getting the treat. If that doesn't stop your dog jumping after a handful of tries, eat the treat yourself whenever he jumps up. That way, you really hammer home that that treat is gone! Be careful though to get the balance right, you don't want to frustrate your dog and lose interest. So for every time it gets it wrong, put the threshold further away from its face to a distance you know it can deal with and repeat the exercise from there a couple of times. A similar technique to desensitisation is Behavioural Adjustment Training. The basic idea is to retrain your dog to defuse situations rather than escalate them. For that you put your dog in a situation that he is somewhat uncomfortable with but doesn't react to yet. That is, you get your dog to walk towards another dog (or have the other dog come towards your unmoving dog) to a distance that he notices the other dog but does not lunge or bark at it. If your dog starts to show any sort of calming signal (averting his eyes, sniffing the ground, turning its head, licking its lips), you mark the occasion with a resounding ""good boy!"" and reward him by removing him from the situation, i.e. walk away with him. Your dog would be much happier if everyone else would just keep their distance, so removing him from an uncomfortable situation can be a powerful motivator for him. For this to work, it is even more important not to ""set him off"". If he does react to the other dog and lunges at him, help him out and move him away from the dog. Make sure to keep him at a much larger distance the next time, as he'll be more sensitive. For this to really work, though, you will probably need the help of a professional, as your timing and your reading of dog body language will have to be spot on. For a fantastic introduction to dog body language, have a look for a DVD called ""Calming Signals"" by Turid Rugaas. There's a five minute intro on YouTube that will give you a sense of how horribly produced it is, but if you love your dog, you will brave the sleep-inducing Norwegian accent and the horrible 90s camcorder look. Because for all the cheesiness and tackiness of the video, it is by far the best video on dog body language I have ever seen. Unfortunately, you might, to some extent, also be part of the problem. Having a reactive dog, it is likely you tense up whenever you see another dog or child in the distance, trying to decide whether they'll come close enough for your dog to react and how you can avoid them. Your dog will pick up on that, whether it is from your body language or because you hold the leash ever so slightly tighter. You being nervous is one more reason for him to keep other dogs as far away from him and you as possible. He will also have learned to associate you being tense with other dogs being around, so he will actively look for them. If you have a friend you can trust to be able to handle your dog under any circumstances, it would be interesting to see him take your dog for a walk to see whether he reacts the same if you are not around. Even just being on leash, however, also puts up his stress levels, as he knows his movement is restricted. Unfortunately, having a history of attacking other dogs when off leash, it won't be easily possible to see how much being on and off leash affects his interaction with other dogs. It will be very difficult and time-consuming to socialise your dog to other dogs, and you can probably never trust him fully around other dogs. But with time and dedication, you can alleviate his behaviour to an extent where you are both comfortable and happy to go on walks and be around other dogs without constantly worrying about what might happen.

"How can we find a dog to ""test drive""?","Fostering is a great way to see if you're ready to commit to a dog, contact your local rescues to see what kind of dogs are available. The perks with fostering are: 1) You're helping a dog in need. 2) You do not need to keep the dog or find it a new home if you decide it's not for you. 3) Shelters typically provide all food and vet care, no cost to you. 4) You may end up falling in love with the dog you foster and keeping that one instead!

What to feed kittens that are only a few weeks old? (Their mother died),"At this young age the kittens still require milk, you can probably get some kitten milk from a vet store, a quality pet store with a knowledgeable staff, or make your own (only if not available elsewhere, as it is extremely hard to get the nutrition correct, but should be safe for a few days until you find a commercially available one). They will have to be fed with a bottle or tube of proper size. If you have a vet available, please get in touch with them as soon as possible as they will be able to give you advice and help you with the supplies you will be needing. From the first article linked below: Emergency Kitten Milk Replacer 3 oz condensed milk 3 oz water 4 oz plain yogurt (not low fat) 3 large or 4 small egg yolks - no whites It is very important to accurately age the kittens, as they may not be able to properly urinate or defecate yet, which is something they are able to do at about 3 weeks. If they are under three weeks, you can take a cotton ball or piece of very soft cloth moistened with warm water, and gently rub the anal and genital area; within one to two minutes the kitten will urinate and/or defecate. Washing: Most washing should be done with a damp cloth, to also teach them to groom themselves, but if they are very dirty it's ok to use warm water under a faucet to clean dirt out. Be careful not to get water in their noses, mouths, and ears. If these areas need cleaning use a dry or moist cotton swab or cotton ball, or a clean piece of cloth. It's important to not leave them wet for too long, as this is a sure way for them to get too cold. Links to help you along:"
Why does my cat put toys in my shoes?,"This is a common behaviour. There are a few different ideas as to why cats seem to like shoes in particular as stash locations. They are small spaces that seem hidden, which cats like - they want to hunt things and then  hide them for later, and the shoes seem like a good sneaky way to hide them away from the other people in the house (or other animals), as they are small and hard to see into and easy to overlook. They are bringing you a present! Cats tend to hunt and bring the kills to whoever they care for (other cats, people, etc), and since your shoes will retain a lot of your personal scent, especially if they are ones you wear often, the cat will associate them with you, and thus put the toys there for you to find as gifts and proof of their hunting prowess.

Cat is tipping over bed-side lamps during the night,"The other answers are good, but I've had success with a more direct approach: outstubborn the cat. Rather than trying to minimize the sound/inconvenience of the falling lamp, try to maximize it. Be creative, e.g. put a bowl with glass marbles on the lamp (I used this + a metallic plate to create a really loud and startling noise). Anything that makes a racket will do. The idea is to teach the cat that knocking over the lamp is not nice. As you said, there's not much drawback to the cat when it gets knocked over now, so make the message clearer by making the experience even less nice. My cat did it twice after I started using the marbles, and never again. However, you will of course not enjoy the loud sounds so it requires some tenacity from your end."
Why do dogs eat grass?,"I have also been told by various sources eating grass helps dogs with digestive issues.  If the dogs are doing it every single time as you state yours are, they may have picked it up as a habit. According to ""A Vet's Take On Why Dogs Eat Grass"" (Modern Dog Magazine), the following possibilities exist:"
"Why do cats lick plastic bags, and is there any harm in it?","Extensive online research shows it is not just plastic bags which appear to be cat tongue attractants, but photographs as well.  The activity of bag licking varies among cats; not all cats lick bags and not all bags get licked.  There is no definitive answer, but most theories support @JohnCavan's answer of bags being rendered with animal fat or having acquired smells.   Unfortunately, the majority of answers found are incestuous, referring to each other. Here is the culmination of what I've discovered, with each reason listing the seemingly independent sites which support each conclusion: Due to the bio-degradable nature of the bag, it was rendered with something that created a lingering odor.  This could be anything from rendered animal fats (""tallow""), lanolin, petrolium products, gelatin, or corn starch.  As regards photographs, Manhattan Cats notes that gelatin is also used in the photo emulsion process, directly connecting photo licking to bag licking. The Feline Express article breaks down bag materials as it relates to cats, noting the manufacturing process may have simply created an odor which we cannot detect, but cats prefer.  Though Chron Blog proposes corn starch, Feline Express dismisses the ingredient, as corn starch bags were only manufactured for a short time among few vendors.  Feline Express continues by dismissing tallow and even fish scales, referencing quotes from manufacturers stating they are not used. Supporting Sites: Vetriscience, Chron Blog, Feline Express, Amazon AskVille, Manhattan Cats, HDW Depending on what the bag has touched or held, there may be lingering odors from the prior contact, which the cat can detect and is trying to taste, or is simply curious about. Supporting Sites: Vetriscience, Chron Blog The coolness of the plastic, or the texture of the material, feels good to the feline tongue, and may even taste good as well. Supporting Sites: HDW, Manhattan Cats Your cat likes the sound of the plastic bag being licked.  It may simulate the noise of a caught animal.  This is dismissed by some sites as unlikely since cats tend to dislike noise. Supporting Sites: Vetriscience, Manhattan Cats, Chron Blog Plastic bag licking is compensation for an unsatisfied dietary craving. Supporting Sites: Chron Blog Your cat may either have pica, the compulsion to eat things which are not food, or obsessive compulsive disorder.  Either seems unlikely since the licking activity is apparently quite common among cats.  HDW proposes the cat may be performing an orally compulsive act to replicate ""nursing"". Supporting Sites: Vetriscience, HDW, Amazon AskVille Per all the sites, you should not allow your cat to persist in licking a plastic bag, as this may tempt them to chew and swallow plastic pieces which may result from the activity.  Consuming these pieces could potentially create intestinal blockage.  Several of the cited sites refer to instances where plastic bags had to be removed from cats, or plastic pieces were found in excrement from the litter box.  Additionally, you might not know the history of the bag; it could have contacted a substance poisonous to cats. I recommend, when possible, that you do not allow your cat to continue licking plastic bags."
How to prevent my dog from barking constantly when I am not at home?,"You can't expect your pet to keep mum if you are not with him. Solutions: Get the dog someone to give him company. When there is no one at home, you can consider  leaving him at some neighbors home awhile. You can request somebody to look after him while everybody has gone from your house. You can provide him something to play with. This is not very effective in every cases. But in 50% cases, it would work. Give a bone toy or a ball to chew with. My own dog likes to play with them and we got rid of the barking problem. Dogs do not like being locked. Just letting him be may work."
My cat gets angry and scared at me if I stand,"Your cat may be interpreting your standing up as an aggressive posture, as cats will arch themselves up to make themselves as tall as possible when they're being scared or aggressive. Or, it may be that your cat is very jumpy, and dislikes the sudden movement, whereas if you're sitting or lying down you're bound to be pretty still. Perhaps it might help if you try to give it positive reinforcement while you are standing, so it starts to associate your standing up with good things. For instance, toss the cat treats while you are standing, or try to play using a feather wand while you are standing. It's important to also try to get the cat to come to you, rather than trying to approach it, so it feels in charge of the situation and not cornered. "
How do I get my cat to wear a tuxedo for several hours?,"Cats look perfect without any clothing.  Dressing a cat is just about as sensible as throwing a blanket over a statue. If you really want a cat to be in a tuxedo, may I suggest a ""tuxedo cat"".  I have a tuxedo  Manx who is always purrfectly groomed. The main difficulties with dressing a cat is that cats have a strong aversion to being put in things by external forces, so I'd say dressing a cat is not terribly nice to them."
Is it ok to pick my adult cat up by the scruff of the neck?,"Of course, there is a huge difference.  I'd never condone holding an 8 kg cat in the air by the scruff of the neck : always keep his back paws on ground, and as far as the answer linked in the question is concerned, release him as soon as he has swallowed his pill.  And don't use scruffing when not necessary. That being said, having tried to pill my cat without scruffing him, I feel it's much more comfortable for a cat to be scruffed during a few seconds than to be gently tortured during 5 minutes or more.  That's a fact. ;) Now, no other facts, but experts advices (the bold weighting is from me) : Traditionally, scruffing (grasping the cat by the scruff of the neck) has been considered an acceptable way to maintain control of a cat because it does not harm the cat if done properly, and it is effective in many cases.  However, scruffing has become a controversial issue.  Some cats react negatively to scruffing and actually fight harder instead of holding still.  Also, some overweight cats have very little loose tissue to scruff, so the hold will be less effective. In general, scruffing should be used only if minimal restraint techniques are not working.  If scruffing seems necessary, try it for a few seconds.  If the cat gets worse, discontinue and try something else.  When scruffing a cat, use the minimum amount of force necessary and take care to avoid injuring the cat's neck.  A cat should not be lifted or suspended by the scruff because this is uncomfortable and may make the cat's behavior worse. (Joanna M. Bassert & John A. Thomas, Clinical Textbook for Veterinary Technicians, 8th Edition, McCurnin's 2013, ISBN 978-1437726800 — p.186.) ‘Scruffing’ is a general term for a variety of holds on the skin of the cat's neck.  Grasping the scruff of the neck varies from a gentle squeeze of skin, to grasping a larger fold of skin with varying amounts of pressure.  Consideration of natural feline behavior can help put this technique into perspective.  Cats grasp the scruff of the neck of other cats in only limited circumstances.  During the first few weeks of life the mother cat may lift kittens by the scruff of the neck using her mouth.  This is a method of transport and immobilization, and not a form of discipline. During mating, the tomcat grasps the scruff of the queen. Some veterinarians and veterinary behaviorists do not use scruffing and do not condone its use.  They find that using other gentle handling techniques is less stressful, more time efficient, provides greater safety for personnel, and allows the cat to have a sense of control.  They prefer other methods to manage situations where feline welfare or personnel safety are at stake. Other veterinarians handle cats gently and use scruffing only if it is necessary to protect the welfare of the cat or for the physical protection of personnel.  Still others think that scruffing a cat is acceptable for short procedures, in an emergency, and to prevent the cat from escaping or injuring someone. If you think this technique is the only alternative, carefully evaluate the cat for any signs of fear or anxiety.  The cat may become immobile but may not be comfortable, or may become aggressive.  Handle the cat as gently as possible and guard against using aggressive handling techniques out of anger or frustration.  The panel does not condone lifting the cat or suspending its body weight with a scruffing technique because it is unnecessary and potentially painful. (Ilona Rodan et al., AAFP and ISFM Feline-Friendly Handling Guidelines, Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery, Volume 13, Issue 5, May 2011, Pages 364-375, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfms.2011.03.012.) Having a sense of control, even if it is not exerted, makes the cat more comfortable and reduces stress.  Importantly, using the minimal amount of handling gives the cat a greater sense of control, so the cat is less likely to be aggressive. […] Most of us have been taught to scruff cats, but scruffing often only increases a cat's arousal and fear, because scruffing removes the cat's sense of control.  Many cats become fearfully aggressive when scruffed in an attempt to protect themselves.  Some veterinarians, especially in Europe, find “clipnosis”¹ helpful for restraint.  This procedure is also controversial, again because it removes the cat's sense of control. In the author's experience (at least 5 years without scruffing or clipnosis), cats are usually calmer and easier to handle if they are not scruffed. (Ilona Rodan, Understanding Feline Behavior and Application for Appropriate Handling and Management, Topics in Companion Animal Medicine, Volume 25, Issue 4, November 2010, Pages 178-188, ISSN 1938-9736, http://dx.doi.org/10.1053/j.tcam.2010.09.001.) ¹ IIUC, clipnosis consists in pinching the scruff of the neck with a clip in order to induce behavioral inhibition — hence the term ""clipnosis"", deriving from ""clip"" and ""hypnosis"". BTW, thanks for asking, I didn't thought about such behavioral implications."
How can I gain back my dog's trust after accidentally kicking him?,"If it means anything to you, dogs have a very high tolerance for pain, so when they scream out it is more because of them being startled or shocked than because of pain.  I accidentally closed a door on my dogs tail, not hard but the startle caused him to let out a loud yelp. He will regain trust you in over time, but an important thing to remember for the future is that dog psychology is VERY different than human psychology.  Your first reaction if you accidentally hurt a child is to immediately fawn over the child and shower him/her with affection.  The child needs to cognitively recognize the accident to get over it. When you immediately get emotional, nurturing and reactive after an accident then you are teaching the dog through your nurturing that you are rewarding them for feeling scared.  Nurturing is a reward for wanted behaviour so in the dogs mind you are telling the dog it is right to be scared and anxious about the very person or situation involved in the accident. The best thing to do is to check the dog for injury, then immediately move on and try to get the dog to not dwell on what happened.  After the dog is calm again, give them a treat to reward them having calmed down and give them extra affection then.  It is never a good idea to give affection to a dog in emotional distress (physical distress is a bit different). You will find the dog will move past the incident rather quickly because the dogs ancestors don't dwell on accidents.  They make their intentions very known through deliberate communication and action.  Dogs also live in the present.  They don't dwell on past memories, their memories of what happened in the past are mostly emotional based and not event based.  Eg. they smell the grounds of a dog park where they were attacked by another dog and they get an emotional surge of fear.  The fear is an automatic reaction."
Cat meows for wet food in morning despite dry food being available,"We had the same problem with our cat. Here's how I solved it (and @Nova did too, once).  When he first came to live with us, he was fed in the morning when I got up and left the bedroom. But one day he became emboldened, and he decided he’d be fed when he wanted to be fed, which was earlier than my regular wake-up time.  Accordingly, he’d wake me up to make that announcement. I found that I didn’t agree with this new policy.  So, starting on the second day of his new behavior, when he'd meow in the morning for his food, I responded by getting out of bed immediately and spraying his face with water from a squirt bottle. The immediate nature of the response was critical because it never allowed him the opportunity to meow repeatedly, which would have reinforced the unwanted behavior.  Then I went back to bed. If the meows repeated (which they did for a few more days, gradually tapering off day by day) I'd respond in kind with another squirt, sometimes chasing him down to ensure he didn’t avoid it. He soon understood that the result of this early morning meowing wasn't food, but water to the face. Within four days, the meowing had stopped completely. Now, more than a year later, he just waits quietly, and when I open the door he greets me happily and gets his food. If you don’t mind the dedication to getting out of bed immediately and consistently (along with the somewhat enhanced level of corrective action) this may do the trick for you. Good luck, and remember YOU are the boss, not the cat. "
What can I do to ease my dogs' fear of loud noises?,"One thing to keep in mind is to not try to comfort your pet. If you secure your pet by using a gentle voice to calm him, it confirms his fear! You are actually telling your dog that it is normal to be scared. The best thing to do is act normal, completely ignore his fear, talk to him normally, play with him as you would normally do and do not allow him to do things you normally don't like sitting on the couch or similar. Your idea of using music to help the dog calm down is good, but do not use it to cover up the sound. Also, you'd want to give him some help to calm down and you can, but don't do it because he is  afraid. Basically, distract him first like stated above, once he ""forgot"" about the storm you can put him in his basket. He will feel comfortable there, as usual, and hopeful unstress. He will then learn by himself to go there when he is scared, but all this should make him less nervous too. Ignoring a puppy might be harder than a big dog, but do keep in mind that comforting a puppy will also have a bigger impact."
How can I help my obese cat lose weight?,"I have had very good luck with two different obese cats using a Tiger Diner cat bowl. They have to work for their food, so they eat more slowly and feel like they are eating more, one of my cats started actually leaving food when using the Tiger Diner. The various food balls and feeder toys are also good. One of the obese cats I've dealt with is also very nervous about food. One thing that helps is to put part of her dry food in one of the timed 'vacation' feeders. She knows that there is food in it and trusts that she will get it eventually but can't eat it right now. This allows her to relax and not stress about getting food. Although it did not work for us, my vet recommended making a broth of water and wet food and offering that in addition to or instead of water. This has the benefit of getting more water into your cat (most cats don't drink enough water) and makes them think they are getting food without a lot of calories. If you can do so without making your overweight cat too nervous, feeding the timid cat in a place too small for the other cats might be helpful as well."
Can my dog get sick from my human illness?,"In the case of the flu, it depends on the strain of it. The specific type of disease that transmits from humans to animals and the other way around is called a Zoonotic Disease. According to PetMD:  The potential for zoonosis depends on a variety of factors, including
  climate, geography, population density, sanitary conditions (or lack
  thereof), grooming habits, and other factors. Something like Swine Flu is a good example and the linked article provides many more.  In the case of ferrets and the flu, its possible to transmit generally human-only strains to them. This is why ferrets are commonly used in studies because their immune system is similar to our own. From Wikipedia:  Because they share many anatomical and physiological features with humans, ferrets are extensively used as experimental subjects in biomedical research, in fields such as virology, reproductive physiology, anatomy, endocrinology, and neuroscience. To really answer your question: In general, no. But there are other factors (like the particular strain of a disease) that can cause you to transmit your disease to your animal. If you're unsure, I think you should attempt to distance yourself from the animal or at the very least try to avoid contaminating their food. "
When is declawing a viable option for cats?,"Declawing is considered a last option before having to hand the cat over to a shelter. It is often only recommended in situations where there is a medical condition that would result in bleeding out at even the most minor scratch. Some other options to use that I have found work very well are Declawing the cat results in permanent damage and can alter cat's behavior and ability to walk without pain.  Learning to manage cat's claws becomes second nature after a while. Also, playing with the kitten with toys only and not with hands should help to prevent claw marks."
Putting a cat into a carrier,"When I put my cats in the Carrier (They don't like it) I use the following method: This is perhaps clearer with a picture, so here is me subjecting one of my cats to this:  Also, as preparation I get my cats in a room where they can't hide, because as soon as they see the carrier they look for a place to hide :-) One last idea is to try to lure them in with a treat, but my cats figured that out pretty quickly and it stopped working."
Can I feed my cat whenever she wants?,"I would not give your cat as much as she wants, obesity is a problem in our pets because they eat too much and don't exercise enough. There are guidelines on the bags of food that tells you how much your pet should be eating of that specific food. Sometimes these guidelines are generous so weigh your kitty every 2 weeks to minimum once a month. From petobesityprevention.org In the October 2016 clinical survey, 53.9% of dogs and 58.9% of cats were classified as overweight (body
  condition score (BCS) 4) or obese (BCS 5) by their veterinary healthcare professional. That equals an
  estimated 41.9 million dogs and 50.5 million cats are too heavy, based on 2016 pet population projections
  provided by the American Pet Products Association (APPA). In 2015, APOP found 53.8% of dogs and
  58.2% were overweight or obese. Cats are known grazers so it's a good idea to purchase an automatic feeder that dispenses portioned food at different times during the day. On average a cat should eat 3/4 of a cup of food or less a day (check the guidelines of the food you have). Cats benefit more from wet food than dry so be sure to add some canned goods, again you would substitute some dry for the increase of wet. Portioning your pets food also allows you to easily see if your pet is losing it's appetite or always begging for more food. Both cases warrant a vet visit to screen for underlying ailments such as diabetes or hyperthyroidism. Here's a good chart to body condition score your cat  DISCLAIMER: To avoid confusion there are 2 different scales - petobesityprevention.org does the 1-5 scale where as now the standard is leaning towards 1-10 scale to be more precise with scoring body condition"
How do I keep a cat out of my Christmas tree?,"We used to hang a bell on a low branch that would ring when the cat started to climb the tree.  We called it the ""cat alarm.""  When it would ring, we would come and get the cat out of the tree right away. Whether or not your cat will eventually get discouraged from climbing the tree is up to your cat.  :) The other thing we did was we cut out a three foot circle out of plywood, and screwed the tree stand down to the plywood.  That way, even if the cat did climb the tree, there was no way he could knock it over."
How do you safely evacuate with cats?,"The first thing to consider is planning.  It is recommended that you keep at least a week's supply of any consumables you will need for your pets in or near your emergency shelter.  You should plan in an emergency how you plan to deal with your pets.  You should also realize that during an emergency you pet is likely going to be acting differently than they will during normal calm periods.  If you have an animal that is normally caged taking them out of the cage then you will want to make sure you have a transport carrier or cage ready that the animal can be safely kept in.   If you have more than one pet, make sure that everyone knows what to do with each of your pets during an emergency and set up who has the primary responsibility for each animal.  Doing this will help get the animals to safety rather than trying to figure out what animals still need to be rescued. Finally as sad as it is to lose a pet your life is much more valuable than that of your pet.  Do not put yourself at great risk to save your pet.  Running into a burning building to look for a loose pet is a lost bet.  If the animal was loose it may already have escaped and run away.  If it is trapped inside unless you know right where it is chances are more likely you will be injured than you will be able to save your pet.  Tell the firefighters where the pet is, if they can save it they will.  Recently an area about 10 miles from my home lost over 1000 homes to an F4 tornado.  The local vet clinics have been offering a weeks free boarding for animals to help their families get a chance to get on their feet.  This is pretty common, as a friend of mine had the vet offer them the same when they lost their house to a fire.  So I would recommend you call your vet and see if they can help, or if they can refer you to someone who can help.   There are also some families offering to foster animals until the families are back in a position to care for their animals.  This is a risk but if you are unable to afford to board your animals for the months it may take to rebuild, this may be an option.  I expect most of the people offering this service are doing so in good faith.  But I would still want to vet them before I turned over any of my animals. This is also something you can plan for.  Talk with your family and friends and see if there is someone willing to commit to helping you out with your pets should the need arise.   This is also something to think about in case you need someone to take care of your animals should you and your family become unable to.  We have an arrangement for our dogs with one friend, and our rabbits with another. So if something were to happen we know they would be taken care of."
Does neutering have any negative effect on the health of a dog?,"Recent studies focusing on pet altering show an emerging concern of spaying or neutering pets too soon can have adverse effects on the animals health. While some will argue that the testing samples are too narrow (focusing on certain breeds) and too small of samples, the results may be of interest to pet owners. While this procedure is the most common pet surgery performed in America, in Europe this operation is considered risky before the age of one, and in general Europe does not typically alter their pets. According to the American Veterinary Medial Association or AVMA and PLOSE ONE a study done at University of California-Davis shows a link between altering and musculoskeletal disorders (hip dysplasia and other joint issues) and some forms of cancer. The study followed 759 Golden Retrievers that showed in several instances intact dogs have a much lower overall incidence of several cancers and joint disorders. Other studies published by JAVMA have shown intact animals mixed and purebred in cats and dogs there are lower incidences of obesity and incontinence.  Many experts believe that the UC-David Golden Retriever study data cannot be applied to all dog breeds. In fact, in a similar exploratory study by UC-Davis using Labrador Retrievers the same links were not found. Also many studies have been shown to prove the opposite of the UC-Davis Golden Retriever study, many altered animals have shown lower incidence of reproductive diseases in AVMA past studies. Many experts feel this is an issue related to the age of the animal being neutered. Earlier castration can cause more adverse effects. However, according to PLOSE ONE's data, intact animal's almost always have the lowest incident of cancer and joint issues among Golden Retrievers even for those who have been neutered later in life. Past studies have also shown a link between early neutering and longevity. The Golden Retriever Club of America had this to say: ""The difference in age at death between intact and neutered dogs probably resulted from
selection bias rather than from any biological advantage to neutering. For example, for a dog to be neutered at 8+ years of age, it must first live at least 8 years. Thus, only older dogs fall in this age category and this artificially results in an older age at death. Also, Goldens in this population were probably neutered earlier in life if they had physical or medical problems that made them unsuitable for breeding."" What should I take away from this research? This research is considered new and emerging and many experts have conflicting ideas about spaying and neutering Even the AVMA Has published an article still advocating the need for spaying and neutering as well as citing its health benefits. Sites like Northwest Spay and Neuter even suggest altering your pet as young as two months old. Listening to your trusted vet on the right age for your pet, because it will depend on your dogs condition and breed.  The truth is there is still a misunderstanding among backyard breeders and the overcrowding in pet shelters. Irresponsible breeding behaviors have led to this push to spay and neuter all pets, and I will personally advise to anyone to spay or neuter their pets as well. Many people will not take the precautions to prevent their dog from having a litter of puppies (because they don't know how or they don't mind if their dog adds to the pet overpopulation). "
My cat demands a lot of attention,"Your cat has been on an emotional rollercoaster ride in the pet shop, and possibly before this, too. She's been meeting lots of people and having little stability in her life, so you need to give her time to put this behind her. If you make some elevated spaces where the cat can see you, she will most likely start to calm down and start to relax more. Cats in general like to have places where they can see what is going on and where they feel safe. You need to create some fixed routines where you engage the cat in play first and then you feed her. Food will make her tired and more relaxed; this will mimic how cats first hunt, eat their prey, and then sleep. The cat needs you to be there for her and she needs to feel she can trust you. How long this might take is up to your cat and you (I have had cats that needed two months to fully settle down in a new home). The play is a good way for your cat to get the stress out of her body, and she will calm down. Just give her the time she needs."
How can I stop my cat from eating too fast and throwing up?,"I really like the specialized ""Tiger Diner"" food bowl. It forces the cat to slow down and ""hunt"" his or her food out of the bowl, resulting in slower (and often less) eating.  I usually use it with dry food, but if you break up wet food into smaller chunks, rather than simply a can-shaped blob, it works just fine. Here is a photo of it: "
How can I stop my dogs from scooting / dragging their butts?,"My dogs also scoot, which indicates it is time to express their anal glands, or ""scent glands"": two internal sacs with openings to the anus, each containing powerfully-scented fluid for marking their poop. By scooting, the dogs are probably trying to express them on their own, all over your carpet, which is a delight to try and remove.  I find that once their glands are expressed, future scooting is prevented.  Glands re-fill over time, so you might need to express them periodically, though expression should also happen naturally when they poop. Do consider that if periodic manual expressions are scheduled, there should be less to express in future... expressions.  Express.  Of note, @KatePaulk from the comments below recommends (and I concur) that periodic expression is a good thing to prevent potential gland impaction / blockage, which could cause them to fill to bursting level, a situation no one wants to deal with. ""So,"" you ask, ""that's all great about expressing the glands, but how do I actually undertake the task of expressing them?""  Expressing anal glands is a horrific process you can pay your vet or groomer to suffer through for you, or you can save a few bucks and do it yourself in the privacy of your own home (hooray!).  I'll explain the process below, as this is how I handle my dachshunds, who are not large dogs (with large glands, containing lots to express).  Certainly, there are videos I can link to, but nothing can quite relate the experience across as a step-by-step process does, so hold onto your seats, no pun intended. Disclaimer: I am not a veterinarian, but I have done this at least one time before. Safety not guaranteed. Must bring your own equipment. Good luck!"
How long is a cat's memory?,"Cats do remember places and people, although where/who they remember, and for how long, is variable (just like humans). There's been some research on feline short-term memory, but I could find less information on long-term memory. This article is rather poorly referenced, but does make some statements about long-term memory that it claims are research-based: Researchers have discovered that there is not much difference between how a cat, a human, or another animal's brain utilizes certain cues to assist in the creation of short and long-term memories. A cat's brain functioning has been compared to that of a two to three year old child and, when compared to a dog, a cat's memory is almost 200 times more retentive. Without repeated and reinforced training, a dog's memory span is about 5 minutes. Cats, on the other hand, averaged about 16 hours, only IF the activity benefited THEM. and  A cat's long-term memories are directly related to experiencing pleasure (benefit) or displeasure (pain, fear or threat). For example, it takes a long time and a lot of patience to gain the trust of an abused or neglected cat. If they suffered physical or mental abuse from a man or child, then they will associate that memory with all men and all children. The same holds true for positive experiences. Every time a cat receives affection, praise, or a treat for doing a specific activity, it is logged into their memory as ""a good thing"" and they will continue to use it to their benefit. The inevitable anecdotes I believe that I've experienced cats remembering me years after we have had prolonged interactions.  One example is a roommate of mine that I lived with about 10 years ago.  His cat is not generally friendly, but we got along very well, and I was one of the few people the cat would actively seek out (i.e. he would climb in my lap and sit there while I pet him).  After my friend moved out, there were periods of 1-2 years in between my visits to his new home, and when I would come over, his cat would still come and climb in my lap for petting.   Over times, my visits have unfortunately become less frequent (I moved out of the area), and while the cat still seems to remember me, he is not as friendly to me as he used to be. Here is a video of someone who claims to have been reunited with their cat over a year after her cat left home and roamed the neighborhood as a feral cat: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnTtc4OCu-E The internet is littered with similar claims.  There is also a host of unreferenced claims about feline memory that I won't include here. However, it is pretty certain that your cat will remember you after 6 months if you interact with the cat on a regular basis. Whether the cat is happy to see you (at first) will be another story... ours tend to seem mad at us when we come back after leaving for a few days, and we get the ""cold shoulder"" for the first day or so :)"
Is dry food better for pets’ teeth?,"Trying to find some peer-reviewed article or book about the subject, I found ""The Manual of Veterinary Dietetics,"" from Saunders / Elsevier. The conclusion is that Soft vs Hard foods don't have any clear winner. Many studies were made or reviewed, and the authors found it hard to compare the conclusions because each study involved different animals, with different methods of analysis. Those authors' conclusion was that animals of the same breed may have more tendency on developing dental problems since their anatomy is different, for example, having more or less space among the teeth. Some special food (textured dry food), on the other hand, could be beneficial in the plaque removing process, and flat rawhide chews of small sizes could help too.

What to do when moving next to a bird sanctuary with a loosely-domesticated cat?,"Whatever your general opinions on free-roaming cats may be, allowing your cat to hunt in a bird sanctuary definitely sounds like a highly irresponsible thing to do. If you'd rather not lock your cat entirely indoors, one option to consider would be to build a secure outdoor enclosure for your cat.  Unlike Allison C, I wouldn't rely on just a fence, no matter how ""cat-proofed"", because cats are really, really good at finding ways over, under or through fences. What does work though, in my experience, is simply surrounding a suitable space on all sides with a durable net or wire mesh, and making sure there are no holes large enough for a cat to get through.  The details will vary depending on what your new house or apartment is like, but it could be as simple as surrounding a balcony / terrace / patio / veranda or any similar ""semi-outdoor"" area with cat-proof net or mesh. For a practical example, here's one of my parents' cats watching the local wildlife from behind a temporary net set up to close off their new ground floor apartment's patio:  and here are both of them in winter (one braving the cold outside, one safe and warm inside behind the window), showing the final (semi-)permanent enclosure we built out of chicken wire:  The new structure extends a few meters into the back yard, so that there's room for a small garden inside, including some vines to climb and partly cover the wire fence (not yet visible in these photos).  It consists of just a few wooden posts and beams that attach to the existing partition walls between the neighboring patios and support a chicken wire fence between them, with the old nylon net now serving as a roof over it (because cats can climb, you know) and the chicken wire extending some distance underground (because they can dig too — not that either of these two have ever tried). We even built a simple lockable gate (half visible on the right side of the second photo) into the fence so that we can still get to the outside (not that there's much there, except some trees and neighbors' back yards) without having to walk around the whole building. The important thing to remember (for your peace of mind, and the safety of any birds living nearby) is that cats can squeeze their head through surprisingly small holes if they're sufficiently motivated, e.g. by tasty birds waiting just outside — and if the head gets through, the rest of the cat will most likely follow.  (For evidence, see e.g. any of these YouTube videos.)  But there are limits, and something like a 1 inch / 2.5 cm mesh size is definitely too small for any adult cat to possibly get through.  Meanwhile, it's still large enough that any small birds or rodents that may unwisely enter the enclosure can also easily get out. Ps. I wrote most of this answer before noticing the How to let an indoor cat have some outdoors time safely? thread, which also has some pictures of outdoor cat enclosures.  I figured I'd post this anyway, because it's still a valid answer and shows a somewhat different style of enclosure."
How to keep my cat stress free during periods of constant 90dB+ sound?,I'm in the UK so our nearest equivalent would be the fireworks displays during Bonfire Night and New Year's Eve so I'll base my answer on what I advise to do during those:
How do I introduce our dog to a brand new baby,"The Humane Society of the United States has a few suggestions to prepare your pet. Some of them sound a little silly, but they do work.  One of the most important things is getting the pet used to the new noises and sounds the baby will make - a lot of pets will find baby cries and the like upsetting. You can play crying sounds and the like to acclimate the pet, for example. As for actual introduction of the baby to the pet, they suggest first giving the animal something with the baby's smell on it (a blanket, etc) so they don't get alarmed by the new smell in the house, if possible.  It is also suggested that you try to keep your pet's routine the same as much as possible, and that you greet the pet first without the baby when you arrive home with your new child.  Basically, you want the pet to interact positively with the baby, so you will want to reward and encourage positive interactions, and at first you might want to limit the time the pet and the baby spend actively together. Bring the baby to sit with the pet, etc (with you holding the baby, of course), for small bursts, extending them over time, as the pet gets used to the baby."
How do I discourage my cat from biting?,"I researched this awhile back when adopting kittens. It seems there are a lot of variables with cat biting. These are some tactics that I've had successful experience with (in slightly different situations): If the cat was biting as a sign of play (your fingers, arm, etc. is like a toy) then ignoring the cat is recommended. First, play with the cat (Never let your body be a toy. You can hold a toy, but never make your body part a toy. Use a toy on a string, a long toy or throw a toy. If it's small just do the best you can. I'm just saying this for everyone that might read it.) If the play session ends naturally (cat gets tired or bored) give him a treat. This is a natural occurrence for cats - to eat after play/hunting. If the cat attacks your hand/food/etc (claws or teeth), pull back to yourself and try making a loud sound as if hurt (sharp short high-pitched yelp or hiss) right at the moment of the attack. Do not delay, animals have difficulty connecting your reaction to what they did unless it's immediate. (If you forget to make the sound - don't do it late.) Leave the room as quickly as possible. Take the toy with you. Try to shut a door between you. Ignore the cat as much as possible for at least 15 minutes, preferably longer, like 30 minutes. If you can't keep the cat out, just keep leaving whatever room your cat is in to signal you do not trust to be in the same room with it. Try playing again the next day. If the cat attacks again before the next play time, try to react as you did earlier, as much as is possible within your schedule.
I was trying to socialize a semi-abandoned outdoor kitten that lived in my landlord's barn. He had a terrible biting and clawing habit. This technique (modified for his barn area) worked amazingly well. (Of course leaving him really did mean leaving him for at least a day. Sometimes I only visited for 1 minute! But in just a week I noticed a difference. He stopped biting and started retracting his claws and focusing on toys and walking next to me instead of attacking.) A vet on NPR discussed that nipping (gentle biting) is a natural cat-to-cat interaction that you may never be rid of. For example, during petting when your cat wants attention and suddenly nips. To the cat, it isn't really hurting you. But a lot of vets point out that you can sometimes predict these nips. The cat may be flicking their tail or turning their ears or head (signaling displeasure) before they do it. They are getting annoyed with your petting, it's too much or not in the right place anymore. To us a bite seems over-the-top, but to the cat it was a gentle correction. ""I swear my cat enjoys it but then it bites."" Then remember that it is possible for something to feel both good and bad, tickling is a common example for humans. Vets also point out that the cat may be anticipating a ""bad petting"" and biting when a person only walks near to warn off the person in advance. Two of my cats tend to bite when they get so into petting that they frenzy. They purr like crazy and start rolling over and pacing back and forth. The more frenzied they get, the more likely they'll suddenly bite. When you walk off, they follow you and rub on you ""asking"" for more petting. The best we've been able to do is stop petting them but stay with them when they start getting frenzied (before they bite). We minimize the petting until they calm back down. This is probably too late for you (I haven't read anything about it working with adult cats) but another tactic is to make sure the cat grows up with other cats. It's been shown that kittens that grow up with siblings tend to tuck in their claws and bite lightly. This is because they learn through experience with each other that claws and biting hurt. Basically, they learn to tone it down so they can continue roughhousing for fun. The cat grows up with ""no-claws"" as the default way to play, even with toys.  I've never heard of the ""hold mouth closed and blow on face"" thing for biting, but I have (since you asked about experience) blown on my cats' faces when they get near my food. I don't touch them at all, I just blow a little puff of air toward their face. It works surprisingly well. Anything else and they just came back, but one puff or two and they walk away for good. So I think that might have been a valid idea as a deterrent, not sure as a punishment. Perhaps kittens are more susceptible to being corrected than adults."
"I can't afford vet treatment, what are my options?","The Blue Cross offer's free veterinary services in cases where the owner is unable to afford vet's fees. Eligibility is determined via means testing of the owner, this is based on whether the owner is in receipt of certain government/council benefits: The RSPCA offer reduced cost veterinary services which are based on essential care. Eligibility varies and should be checked with your local branch. The PDSA offers both reduced cost and free services at any of it's 48 UK animal hospitals subject to eligibility. For reduced cost services people in receipt of one or more of the following are eligible: The free service is limited to one pet only where the owner is in receipt of one or more of the following: If none of the above services can help and the situation is an emergency then you can take your pet to a vet and as part of their registration with the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons they are obliged to provide short term emergency treatment where the animal is suffering. This really is only going to provide the most basic level of treatment necessary to alleviate the immediate suffering and you should always be up front with the vet about your ability to pay (as otherwise you could be looking at Fraud charges) and I cannot stress enough that this is a last resort emergency option only."
How to let an indoor cat have some outdoors time safely?,"Supervised outdoor time is fine, provided that you take adequate precautions to ensure that the cat stays supervised. We've let our cats out onto enclosed balconies, and an enclosed screened-in porch, and they clearly enjoyed it (well, 2 of the 3).  A cat harness, such as John Cavan suggests, is also a good solution, although some cats will not handle any sort of leash or harness well at all. Some people even go so far as to build elaborate outdoor cat enclosures:  (Here are more images) My mother built one for her two cats, and they definitely seem to enjoy it (hers is nowhere near as elaborate as the one pictured above). The important thing is to ensure that your pets are safe while outside.  Cars, other animals (not just dogs, but also other cats, and various other mammals depending upon where you live), or even your neighbors can all pose serious risks to a cat."
My cat seems to dislike the idea of a morning walk. Should I continue?,"Putting a cat on a leash and walking it around isn't species-appropriate. You can and should do that with a dog, but cats usually hate that. They value their autonomy. The idea ""My cat will feel safe when I am around"" is wrong. Cats don't think that way. While they are social animals, they aren't herd animals like domesticated wolves dogs or humans who have a ""strength in numbers"" survival strategy. Cats don't protect each other, unless it's a mother protecting its kittens. For adult cats, it's an everyone-for-themselves world. Their survival strategy is to hunt anything that's weaker, hide from anything that's stronger and intimidate anything where it's unclear. Your cat will not feel more protected when you are around because it doesn't expect you to protect it. If anything, you make it more anxious because the leash limits its fight and flight abilities. Also when outside what my cat wants to do is to simply run to the nearest bush and get inside to hide. That's normal cat behavior. When you put a cat in a new environment, it will first look for a safe hiding spot. It will start to explore on its own when it has deemed the environment to be safe. You can't force that by forcing your cat out of its hiding spot. That just induces stress. Even in familiar environments, cats will often have hiding spots. That's because they are ambush predators. If you can't see it, the delicious mice can't see it either. Here are some cows, and when my cat sees one she gets terrified. All her hairs go straight as if to make her look larger than she already is. And she simply refuses to move any further.  That doesn't sound like fear. When a cat is afraid, it will run away and hide somewhere. Does the cat face the cows, head down and back up? Does it hiss? That's intimidation behavior. The cat wants to demonstrate to the cows that it isn't afraid of them and that it will stand its ground.  Intimidating cows might not make much sense to you, but remember that your cat is inexperienced with the outside world and unfamiliar with its own strength. It might not realize that cows are stronger than it but still rather harmless. So what's the solution? As the other answers said. Cats can live a perfectly happy and healthy life if kept indoor all the time. You just need to provide a cat-appropriate environment with lots of things to play with, climb on and hide in and you need to control its calorie intake so it doesn't become overweight. If you think that being outside is a more appropriate lifestyle for your cat, let it go outside by itself and let it explore the outside world on its own pace. It's a dangerous place out there and it might get hurt and killed, but there is nothing you can do about that if you want your cat to enjoy it."
Why does my cat bring me her toy?,"I saw a documentary that says cats will bring 'prey' (this included dead plant particulate as well as animals in the show) to their owners, because they believed they were bringing sustenance to the pack when they might not be able to obtain it themselves. So your cat probably thinks you're a bad hunter and she's trying to keep you alive. The things she has to do for you. :)) My cat does a similar behavior with his little ball toys with the bells in them. He'll pick them up by biting through the slots and then he'll walk around the house yowling. He doesn't do it often, but in his case, he's asking someone to take it and throw it for him to chase. He likes to hide around a corner and have someone roll it in from the other room so that he can pounce and swat it. He'll knock it around for a while, then bring it back to your general vicinity and drop it for you to throw again. It could be that your cat wants you to play with her."
How can I keep my cat from climbing on my desk?,"He gets lonely after losing his companion. Attention seeking adventures on your desk help him a lot. Every kind of attention you give a cat is attention. The cat gets noticed. Be it just a lifting off the desk or whatever, he gets what he came looking for. When you know you are going to work at the desk, start by playing with your cat first. After a healthy session of playing, you feed him. If he is on constant food offer, then you feed him those treats. What is important is that after the play he eats something. After eating you should have a satisfied cat lying on the sofa instead of harassing you on the desk. First of all, remove the treats from the desk drawer. Put garlic in there instead. The unpleasant smell of garlic should turn the previously interesting hiding place of treats not so interesting. There are a <selection of scents> that cats are said to dislike; for example citrus, lavender, rosemary etc. The smell of garlic has worked wonders for me. There is also a technical approach to this. It is a movement sensor actuated spray of odorless liquid that is supposed to scare a cat away from a certain place. In this case you would place the device somewhere on your desk and turn it On when you leave the desk. I have not used this myself, but a cat owner friend (having two cats) tells me it works nearly perfectly. Product name is ""ssscat"" in Amazon.com and you can order refill bottles for it too. 
photo by Maritta Arvilommi, used here with permission. If this does not work, I think giving up is advisable. Give up like you own the place: if there is a shelf of sorts on your desk, or right next to it, I suggest to make a bed for your cat up there. You know, something that he finds comfortable to lie on. If you currently have no suitable platform for this, buy something. Your cat should find the platform/shelf a good vantage point from where to keep an eye on you and your business. This leaves only the problem of how he will get there."
What happens if cats drink coffee?,"According to petpoisonhelpline.com, caffeine poisoning is ""[g]enerally moderate to severe/life-threatening"", but while ""[...] cats appear to be more sensitive to the effects of caffeine than people"", ""1-2 laps of coffee, tea or soda will not contain enough caffeine to cause poisoning in most pets [...]"". So you should be safe with the current situation, but please do be careful!"
How can I train a dog to behave with a cat?,"I'm not a professional trainer, but training is what I would do if faced with such a condition: Take the cat into my lap while the dog is watching and caress him (the cat) to make it clear to my dog: he's one of us. Opposite direction: when the dog bites the cat's tail, yell at him to stop. If he repeats it many times, say ""bad dog"" and ignore him for few hours. Eventually, even the most stubborn (or stupid :) ) of dogs will take the hint and leave the cat alone."
How to train a dog to poo in a particular part of the garden?,"Ultimately positive praise, reward, and repetition are the keys. When taking him out after meals, try to direct your dog to the particular area in which you would like him to relieve himself.  You will have to stay with him and try to encourage him to remain in that area until he goes.  Once he does, provide him with positive praise and rewarding him (food rewards obviously will work best).  And keep repeating until he picks up on the idea. However, just like with paper training an apartment dog or regular house-breaking, accidents will happen.  It is important that you do not punish him for going where you don't want him to go, especially very early in the training.  It will only confuse him and possibly associate the punishment with going to the bathroom, which will complicate matter significantly.  "
How can I free a snake from duct tape?,"The last thing you want to do is forcibly remove the snake from the tape. Doing so will harm the snake, by pulling off its scales. Sorry, but touching it is out of the question. Unfortunately you're going to have to get close if you want to save the snake. It's a harmless snake, so you have nothing to be afraid of. You can wear gloves if that makes you more comfortable, or have a friend help you. The first thing you want to do is carefully trim away the tap that isn't stuck to the snake. You'll want to avoid having it get stuck even more. The trick to removing the tape is using vegetable oil. It will be harmless to the snake and will interfere with the glue on the tape more than water will. Use a cotton swab to apply the oil to the edges of the tape, and slowly work it free. This is where you will most likely have to hold the snake, as it will be stressed and try to escape. Just make sure to be extra careful around the snake's mouth, because the oil could potentially block the airways that run along side the mouth. I can't tell from the picture, but if the tape has stuck itself to the snake's eye, it would be best to take it straight to a veterinarian to have the tape removed, just in case it ends up removing the eye."
How can I measure the weight of my cat?,"Do you have a (preferably digital) bathroom scale? If so, weigh yourself. Now get off the scale and let it reset. Pick up the cat and weigh yourself holding the cat. Subtract."
Can I feed my cat a vegetarian or vegan diet?,"Although PETA seems to say that it's perfectly healthy, cats are not vegetarian and thousands of years of evolution has made them into carnivores.  They have a specific requirements for nutrients that vegetarian diets just cannot provide. With the exception of special situations where the cat requires a modified diet, vegetarian diets should be avoided. As noted below, cats have issues producing Vitamin A & D as well as taurine, which are difficult to get from a vegetarian diet. Vitamins A and D: Dogs and cats cannot make vitamin D in their skin, so it needs to be in their diet. And the vitamin D needs to be D3, which comes from animal sources, not D2, which comes from plant-based sources. “People and dogs can use D2 to some extent, but cats really need D3”, Heinze says. Taurine. Dogs can make taurine if provided the right building blocks through dietary protein. Cats cannot make their own taurine at all, so it is regarded as an essential amino acid in this species and must be present in adequate amounts in the diet. Both species can suffer taurine deficiencies. If attempting a vegetarian/vegan diet, consulting a vet first is crucial, and then only going with cat food that has been specifically formatted in order to provide the required nutrients. Attempting a 'home grown' vegetarian diet is not healthy for cats and can kill them or cause serious harm. In no conditions should a vegetarian/vegan diet be attempted with a kitten. Source"
Can I make a baby wild rabbit a pet?,"There are several legal issues with making wildlife into a pet, these laws vary by location and any response on that topic would be out of scope for this site. It happens that Saturday; I met a woman whose children found a baby cotton tail rabbit and kept it in captivity for several years (I believe she said 13).  It was particularly interesting to note that the rabbit did not appear to become the friendly creature we expect with domesticated bunnies.  But this is not in itself conclusive, as any animal who is not suitable handled and trained, will not become a ""suitable pet"".   I spend a lot of time doing domestic bunny eduction, and interacting with the public who have used varied methods of interaction with a ""pet bunny"".  In this case I got the impression that the care provided to the wild bunny was neither significantly better or worse than average domestic care. In the end I left the conversation feeling that the experience was not as rewarding for the family or the bunny as one would expect with a domestic bunny. Again depending on local laws your local shelter may or may not be able to intake wildlife.  You may wish to consider searching for local ""wild animal rescue"" organizations, and discussing the situation with them. You should keep the wild bunny separated from your pet bunnies, as most if not all of the illnesses and parasites that infect wild rabbits can cross to your domestic bunny. In the end if you want a bunny to be a good pet, obviously the best results will be with one of the domestic breeds.  Expand Last evening I attended a presentation by Jill Argall who is the Director of the Wildlife Center for the Pittsburgh Animal Rescue League (ARL) they intake both domestic and wild cotton tail rabbits (the public often does not know the difference).  She said that the difference in response to humans was significant between the wild and domestic species of rabbits.  They have good results with releasing young weaned cotton tails rabbits as well adults who are brought injured.  The ARL has both wildlife and domestic animal programs.  Domestic rabbits would transfer to the shelter system, to be placed for adoption.  Wild rabbits would stay in the wildlife system to prepare for release."
How can I tell if my cat is happy?,"Some common indicators that a cat is happy and relaxed include: If you know your cat well, you can generally get an idea of the indicators that ""depend"". For example, Hunter (our only non-Siamese) meows only in distress while the three other cats talk all of the time about everything (my food bowl is empty, my food bowl is full, my food bowl is downstairs and I'm upstairs, hey I can meow!). Distress purring has a different sound than happy purring (it's subtle, but pay close attention next time you take your cat to the vet and you may be able to hear it). In addition, if your cat is meowing but you aren't sure what it means, you can look for other clues to help you figure it out. If your cat is meowing while standing next to the food bowl and you haven't fed them in several hours, it's probably distress (help help I'm going to starve!).  If your cat is purring while snuggling with you on the couch (fur/whiskers/tail relaxed) then your cat is probably happy."
Is it okay to feed my cats canned tuna?,"Probably one of the worst things tuna has, is the high levels of mercury. Even in humans, high levels of mercury acts as a neurotoxin, damaging the brain and nervous system. Since cats have a much smaller body mass than humans, their tolerance for mercury is going to be lower as well. For that reason, it's important to limit how much tuna you feed your cats. There was actually a study done in 1974 titled ""Neurological Changes in Cats following Long-Term Diet of Mercury Contaminated Tuna"" by Louis W. Chang, Seiya Yamaguchi and Alden W. Dudley, Jr. Unfortunately the article is behind a paywall, but it can be accessed here, and the first page and an abstract can be viewed. I will try to summarize my understanding of the study below: Sixteen kittens (both male and female) were fed a daily diet of tuna
  that contained a mercury content of 0.5 parts per million. They were
  given vitamin supplements to cover for the nutrients lost in a tuna
  only diet. The study lasted 11 months and an average of 21.1kg of tuna
  was consumed by each cat, along with an average of 6.3mg of mercury. What they found was that there were no observable changes in their
  growth rate or body weight, but at seven months three of the cats
  showed outward signs of neurological disturbances. Of the three cats
  showing symptoms, two of them showed transient symptoms (meaning the
  symptoms seemed to disappear after 24 hours), and the third displayed
  severe ataxia and incoordination in movements until the end of the
  experiment. After the 11 months, the insides of the cats were observed, and
  histopathological lesions were found in the nervous systems of the
  majority of the cats studied (I couldn't find the exact number). The
  most prominent lesions were found in the cerebellum, at the deep sulci
  of the cerebellar folia. Many of the granular cells (neurons) were
  found to be dense and pyknotic (Irreversible condensation of cells). The amounts of mercury allowed in tuna hasn't changed over the years I don't think. Even today, the amount of mercury found in Tuna, on average, matches the study at 0.5ppm. But it is important to note that the EPA does not take action until it reaches 1.0ppm, which means that you're likely to see ranges both aboth and below 0.5pmm to reach that average. The FDA has a monitoring program as well. There is another dangerous chemical that you can find in canned tuna, and raw fish in general. That chemical is thiaminase. Thiaminase is an enzyme that attacks and inhibits the processing of thiamine, commonly known as vitamin B1. Cat's need high contents of B vitamins in their diet, so feeding a cat too much raw fish would give them a thiamine deficiency. The side-effects of which include seizures and a loss of control over body movements. It's important to watch what the tuna is packed with as well. Tuna comes packed with either water, or oil. The oil is bad for cats as it can cause a vitamin E deficiency, which in turn causes problems with their muscles1. So you'll definitely want to try and stick only to tuna packed in water. Check the ingredients as well. Tuna also comes either salted or unsalted. As too much salt can cause electrolyte imbalances in cats, it would be best to only get the unsalted tuna (You can always add salt to the portions you eat). Some tuna also has onions and garlic added to it. Both are poisonous to cats. Other things that I would suggest you watch for is if your cat has possible allergies to fish, as fish is one of the more popular allergies that cats can have, and if your cat becomes to addicted to the taste of the fish. Just like children, give them a choice between something delicious tasting and something healthy, they'll take the delicious tasting food. With all this being said. It's won't be harmful to give your cat(s) a tiny bit of tuna as a treat on occasion. But it's really important to keep it in moderation. There are some good uses for tuna. Because it smells so strongly, it can be used to capture stray cats for catch and release programs. If a cat is sick and/or refusing to eat, a little bit of tuna mixed in might get them to eat. 1See ""The Cornell Book of Cats: A Comprehensive & Authoritative Medical Reference for Every Cat & Kitten"" and ""Nutrient Requirements of Dogs and Cats (Nutrient Requirements of Domestic Animals)"" for more information on Steatitis."
Why is iceberg lettuce bad for rabbits?,"In short, iceberg lettuce is mostly water with little to no nutrient value. A rabbit can fill up on it (because of the bulk), but still need food because they didn't get enough calories, vitamins, minerals, etc. If you look at the USDA's webpage on iceberg lettuce. You'll notice that water makes up just about 95% of the nutrients, leaving 5% to be divided up between every other nutrient. Protein is a little less than 1%, Carbohydrates less than 3%, and sugars less than 2%. Most importantly, you want to pay attention to the vitamin and calorie content. Iceberg lettuce has only 14 calories per 100 grams (2 calories or less in each leaf), and 18mg of calcium. Other effects to consider, is when fed straight from the fridge, lettuce will be cold and wet, both are conditions that can upset a pet's stomach. In addition, since most rabbit breeders do not feed lettuce to their baby rabbits, it is an unfamiliar food and if the rabbit owner does not add lettuce to the diet gradually, it will cause stomach upset. Finally, it is often believed amoung rabbit breeders that Rabbits should not eat some lettuces (such as iceberg) as they contain a substance called laudanum which can be harmful in large quantities. RSPCA: Rabbit Diet Myths But this is disputed because Lettuce does not contain laudanum. Edible lettuce does contain a chemical called lactucin which is a component of lactucarian. Lactucarian is the milky fluid found in some species of lettuce and occurs in much larger amounts in wild lettuce, Lactuca virosa. Lactucarium has sedative and analgesic effects. It creates a sense of mild euphoria. The milky exudate resembles that of opium and it can also be reduced to a thick substance which can be smoked in the same way as opium. As a result of which it acquired the name ‘lettuce opium’. Edible lettuce, Lactuca sativa, does not even contain lactucarium although it does contain lactucin which is in lactucarium. Lettuce for Rabbits and Guinea Pigs (note that rabbits and guinea pigs have different digestive systems, this link is included for the information on lettuce composition). It is not known if lactucin turns into lactucarium during the digestive process in the rabbit, there are some accounts of rabbits appearing sedated after ingesting large quantities of lettuce. Regardless of the laudanum/lactucin status, there's no reason to feed iceberg because of the low nutrient value. The House Rabbit Society's website has even more details on what foods are good for rabbits and why."
Active wildlife outside the window- Good or Bad for Cat psychology?,"I've heard pet owners express concern before that cats get frustrated at being unable to catch prey, but the thing is, they should be able to deal with the frustration because it's natural to be unable to catch prey a large percentage of the time. In the wild, all predators often fail to catch prey, sometimes more often than they succeed. There are also any number of natural situations in which the cat will be aware of the prey, but the prey will be out of reach. For instance, the prey animal has dived into a hole. Therefore, I do not think your cat getting frustrated should be a concern. Meanwhile, as you said, being able to watch provides great benefit in keeping the cat entertained.  However, make sure to still play with your cat on a regular basis, and use a physical toy that it can grab onto, so that it can also exercise and take out its hunting instinct. Your cat will be less interested in actually attempting to chase the animals it sees outside if it's being tired out in other ways. "
Why is my dog eating poop?,"Like you have noted, coprophagia (the technical term for feces-eating) can, like dirt eating, be a response to a dietary need (often stuff like missing enzymes and the like in their diet).  If the dog eats a dry-food only diet, they will be missing certain things that might make them more prone to seeking out poop as a way of filling that need for digestive enzymes. It can also be a stress response - dogs who are anxious or stressed have a tendency to eat poop more often, as do dogs who have been excessively punished for making messes in the house, for example. Attention seeking can also account for it as well - negative attention is still attention after all! I can also just be an oral fixation, which usually can be solved with giving the dog something better to chew on than poop.  There are a few things you can do to stop the behaviour. If you know the dog is eating its own poop, there are products you can add to its food to make the poop taste undesirable. You can also work with your dog to teach it a ""leave it"" command, but if the dog is outside without you present, this will be less effective, as then you won't be around to stop the dog from eating it. There are also things (such as bitter apple and bitter orange spray) that you can put on the poop itself to make it less interesting to the dog. In general, the best suggestions are to keep the yard poop-free, or to train your dog to leave things alone on command. "
When leaving my dog alone is it better to leave some lights on or all off?,"It depends on the individual animal, of course, but the wolf ancestors of domesticated dogs are nocturnal, and dogs have good low-light vision. Most dogs are not afraid of darkness. For roughly the same evolutionary reasons, most dogs won't be kept awake by light; they've been domesticated to follow a roughly diurnal schedule but their wolf ancestors slept mostly during the day. And indeed many dogs seem to prefer to sleep in patches of sunlight (although it's likely the warmth rather than the light itself they're seeking...)"
Recommendations for introducing kittens to adult cats,"The article ""Integrating Kittens with Cats"" (W.V. Cats) provides intricate details on a procedure for introducing kittens to adult cats.  According to the article, the paraphrased steps (backtrack to the prior step if there is an issue) are: Keeping the new kitten / cat separate from the household for multiple days. Providing scents from each feline involved to each other; transmitted through use of cloths.  This begins the process of a safe introduction. Non-interactive transference of each cat to the other territory to continue scent familiarization. Visually introducing the cats for a few minutes, without physical interaction. Feeding or rewarding the cats near the territory borders. Introducing the cats physically under intense supervision. Introducing the cats for longer visitations Allow unhindered interaction, but separate when unsupervised Allow unhindered, unsupervised interaction"
How can I safely pick up a garden snail?,"As a child I've always picked up snails by their shell. No matter if it were small snails or burgundy snails. Their houses are sturdy enough that you wont crush them when you pick them up, just apply enough pressure to safely grab it. Use as many fingers as you can so 
the pressure is distributed evenly.   A snails foot is well protected by the mucus on it. They also secrete mucus from the foot to aid in locomotion by reducing friction, and to help reduce the risk of mechanical injury from sharp objects, meaning they can crawl over a sharp edge like a straight razor and not be injured. As long as you are careful and don't rip the snail away from the surface, you should be safe lifting the it slowly. As soon as you gently pull it, it should let go of whatever it foot attached to or if it is too light, light a small twig, you will lift that, too. Another way is to touch the snails antennas. This usually makes the snail retract into her shell which makes picking it up even easier. Of course you have to be careful not to hurt the snail."
Do invisible fences pose long term health risks to dogs?,"The primary safety issue with invisible / electronic / underground fences is that they do not protect your pet from people and animals coming to your dog and possibly harming it. A standard fence, for example, keeps unfriendly dogs out as much as it keeps your dog in.  As for the collars, I bought a Tri-Tronics vibration only collar for one of my deaf dogs (and then trained the vibration to be a positive experience.) The manual was the same as the one for shock collars and it recommended that for the dog's health and safety that you make sure the dog has an extra pad of fur underneath where the electric part hits. I read that as the manufacturer saying they aren't necessarily safe as is.   There are also a number of risks to using punishment based training at all, these are well covered in the  ""American Society of Veterinary Behavior Punishment Position Statement"" Keep in mind that if you get such a fence, you also need to train your dog to the boundary, so that the collar only goes off when they break the 'rules' they have already learned. It is possible to teach this behavior without purchasing the fence in the first place. Additionally, the fence itself can negatively reinforce behaviors other than leaving the yard - Trainer Experiences with Invisible Fencese"
One month old puppy pacing in circles and crying,"I took her to a good vet today. She checked her, found that she was blind, but she was responding to sounds well. She was pacing in circles when she got stressed. Today with this new knowledge, I brought her home, started training her with sounds. She started responding well, she would circle a bit and then once she recognizes where the sound came from, she would walk in that direction. She even started drinking and eating on her own after she got comfortable with me. I have to hold the food and water up to her mouth, and she would eat/drink it, technically not by herself, but it's a big improvement compared to feeding her with syringe. Thanks for your help guys. UPDATE- 15-Mar-2021 She is now eating well. No need to hold the container near her mouth anymore. She identifies objects and people, and has become better tuned to focus on sounds and smells. She has become familiar with her surroundings now, and knows where things are at. She is eating more compared to the other two pups now, also she has started play fighting with the other pups. Before she was always confused and unable to fight back. I feel she is on a path to a healthy normal dog life."
How can I prevent my cat from extending his claws when being petted?,"This behavior is known as ""kneading"", and is an instinctive behavior that stems from feeding on its mother's milk.  Kittens knead at their mother to stimulate milk production while feeding, and the behavior tends to reoccur whenever they are feeling extremely relaxed and contented. Not all cats maintain this behavior into adulthood, but many do. Since it is both instinctual, and reinforced during early kittenhood, it is unlikely you will ever train your cat to stop.  However, a solution that may work is to get your cat his own blanket.   One of our cats kneads pretty regularly, even when no one is petting her.  She does so most often on a soft red throw blanket, that we keep on the back of the sofa (one of her preferred resting/kneading spots) for that very purpose.  This avoids damage to the furniture, and when company comes over, we can just put the blanket away."
How can stop my adult cat from urinating in inappropriate places?,"The first step for a responsible pet owner when their pet exhibits a significant change (such as described here) is to take the animal to the vet to make sure that there are no health problems.  Health problems can cause litter box issues in several ways.  Once health problems have been ruled out, start looking for behavioral solutions. For one of our cats this phase took 2 years, so be patient and consider everything. First, look at changes in the environment. Have you changed litter? Are the dogs new to the household? Have you moved? Etc. If you aren't able to identify any changes (there's been a change, but sometimes it's hard to find), then start laying out litter boxes.  One suggestion is to put a box everywhere he's gone. Another suggestion is to just put out a bunch and make sure that you clean the places he's been really well (use a blacklight to ensure it's gone).  Try different types of boxes (covered, uncovered, different sizes, different heights(sometimes an older cat will have a hard time getting into a tall box), different shapes, etc). Try different types of litter. Try different locations (some cats want a quiet place away from traffic, others want to be in the middle of everything).   Keep using the blacklight to track where he's going and make sure you clean where he's been really well. If you don't get rid of the smell, the cat will continue to associate that spot as a place to urinate. There are some cleaners you can use, like Nature's Miracle, or some common household products, such as vinegar. Don't use bleach to clean cat urine, as that can actually act as an attractant. Some notes from my own experience: We went through a phase with one of our cats where I changed litter suddenly and then he wouldn't go back to the box even after switching back to the original litter. I locked him in the bathroom with the litter box for about 2 days (with food and water placed on the other side of the room from the litter box), and then he was fine again. We have another cat who has anxiety/territorial issues. We tried her on prozac, but that didn't help the litter box situation. Eventually, we set up her own litter box in the master bathroom, moved her food and water bowls to the bedroom, and made that her territory. When we are asleep or not home, she's in there with the door closed. She only interacts with the other cats when we are able to supervise. That's mostly fixed the problem (occassionally when we're home another cat uses her litter box, so we also switched to cat genies, a type of automated box, so she has a fresh box that's hers and we don't have to clean that box immediately if another cat uses it). Good luck!"
Do dogs commit suicide?,"This is an interesting question.  Personally based on the information I've seen, I don't believe a dog has the cognitive ability to decide that death is better than their life.  They probably can't even comprehend what ""death"" is.  The idea of committing suicide is a very advanced thing to think about. I'm sure we've all heard the classic idea of ""self-awareness"", where it was proposed that humans are the only animals that are self-aware.  According to this wiki article, this idea extends to a few other animals, namely apes, elephants and dolphins.  Self-awareness  But self-awareness would probably be necessary to knowingly cause your own death. Also, a smaller part of this I think would be the idea of time.  When you commit suicide, you're deciding that your future won't get better over time.  The Jury is out on whether or not one could consider a dog to have a sense of time, but there are some interesting reads DOG BEHAVIOR
Do dogs understand the concept of time? Overall I think that it's possible for a dog not to have the ""will to live"" but I think that choosing their own death is a bit too advanced for his mind"
"What forms of ""body language"" can be identified in snake behaviour?","There are roughly three kinds of moods you need to be able to tell apart in snakes: Hungry / looking for food Scared / pissed off Relaxed / exploring around How exactly these moods look differs immensely between species and even specimens. Even snakes can have wildly varying personalities. For example, the ""essing up"" which my boa constrictor will sometimes do is a defensive/offensive stance, and suggests that it might strike, Not necessarily. Sure, having this 'S'-shape in their body will mean that if they strike, they can suddenly cover a bigger distance, but that doesn't mean that always if they coil up like this they want to strike, and neither do they always coil up before striking. So all in all, it is a bad indicator.  My Boa will just idly hang down her branch. This kinda looks like an ambush position, but that does not reflect her attitude when the cage is opened, so I'm going to chalk it up as idle. My Ball python will also do this as a part of their defensive posture, even when they have no intention of striking. Having their head closer to their body also means that it is easier for them to protect their head. All in all, I'd say it isn't the best indicator for their mood. Snakes have very bad eye-sight. So they rely very much on scent as sense. For this they use their iconic tongue-flicking. Each time they do that, they smell their surroundings using an organ in the top of their mouth. The way they use this is very indicative for their mood. If they are relaxed and moving around, they'll just flick lazily every now and then to take in their surroundings, to check if there is anything interesting somewhere. When they have to be more aware of their surroundings, for example if they feel that they are in danger, or that there is food somewhere nearby, they will be flicking a lot more. Mostly I would describe it as much more agitated. Many short flicks. At this point, it is still hard to distinguish food-mode from angry-mode, but that will come with: This is about the situation when you are near the snake, with the cage open for example. How does the snake react to your movements. If they are relaxed, they might very well just ignore you. They'll go about their happy business, whether that is sleeping (likely) or exploring (depends a bit on species).  As you can see above, she is just moving around, minding her own business, tongue-flicking every now and then and ignoring my movement with the camera :) However, if they are agitated, they will be much more inclined to follow any movement around them. This might be very subtle, like tracking the movement just with an eye, or they might just follow it with their head. This is a point where it is easier to tell defensiveness apart from a food-response. Snakes that feel threatened are not likely to give chase. Of course it depends on the species and disposition of the snake, but if they feel threatened, most of all they just want to be left alone. Getting away is always a win. However, if the threat doesn't go away, they might bite. Some species decide to bite very quickly, some species are known for being general assholes, but most commonly kept snakes are pretty laid back. For example, my Ball python is 10 years old now, and in the 8 years I have had him, he has struck only twice out of self-defense. In contrast, if the movement has sparked their interest because they think it is food, their reaction (on top of tongue-flicking) will be more forward. They will be much more inclined to follow the movement in a forward direction, inching towards it. This can be seen in the gif below. This is my Boa's reaction to food in its enclosure. You can see their immediate attention. You can see her tongue-flicking and essing up. But the two most important things to take away here are that she moves her head towards any movement and actively follows it, along with creaping forward. This shows a great deal of interest, and her going forward towards the movement is a great tell that this is not a defensive posture.  When you are handling your snake and they are not comfortable, this might also show itself in the snake suddenly trying to move away quickly, as if they are trying to flee. This should really speak for itself. A lot of this is down to experience and really relies on getting to know your snake. Some snakes are really keen on food and will turn into food-mode on a whim. It is important to know how to recognise this and when you only just have the snake, it is never a bad idea to err on the safe side. If you do it right, you should never really be the target of their food-mood. First you get to know what triggers it, then you make sure you prevent that from happening whenever it is not time for food. For many snakes, one such trigger will be the scent of their food. This is generally easy to handle by making sure food items are only nearby when it's actually feeding time and by washing your hands afterwards. Similarly, after a while you'll learn to notice when your snake is not comfortable and be able know when to leave them alone."
Is it ok to adopt a kitten if you have a murderous cat?,"First, step back and read up on best ages for kittens to leave their mother. (The best age to adopt a kitten is around 10 weeks.)  At 3 weeks of age a kitten is completely helpless and will need help with every thing from keeping warm to drinking (it cannot eat yet) and relieving itself. Till 6 weeks you are just fostering a kitten, let the mother take care of the kitten, please. Weeks 6 to 12 are needed for socializing from the mother. Your cat seems to have no problem with a (very) small dog. So I think you can introduce an other cat into the house. Then becomes the question: how to introduce a new cat into your home? That can be done, but it will take time. Experiences vary, mine was about 2 months before my 2 cats could safely be in one room... Good reads on this topic:"
How deep should I bury my pet (should I rebury)?,"Depending on where you live, burying your pet in your yard may be illegal.  You should check your local laws, before undertaking a reburial. If the area is in a neighborhood, the possibility that a neighbor's dog may find and remove your pet is very high, given the depth the you describe. Also, as you mention, the risk of wildlife exposing the body is significant.  A shallow grave is more likely to allow smells and other evidence of the decaying body to be noticeable in the area.  According to some sources, the appropriate depth for a green burial is 3 - 4 feet (Meter +).  There are also health concerns for any other bunnies now in your home or in the future (and possibly you or your loved one).  As an example Encephalitozoon cuniculi occasionally called 'EC' is a debilitating organism 'which can survive for a long time in the environment'. It can infect both humans and particularly devastating to rabbits.  A shallow grave may allow this or other organism to be transmitted, this is of particular concern if a contagious diseases was the cause of your pets death.  Your local vet should be able to address available options in your area."
What is required to house break a rabbit?,"Rabbits are very clean and easy to train for litter tray use. In nature, rabbits spend a lot of time in hutches and warrens, so learning to use a corner rather than where ever they are keeps their living area clean. This means your job as a rabbit owner is much easier as evolution has done most of the hard work. Most... When first house training your rabbit, confine them to a small section of the house, preferable one that is easy to clean such as an area with non-absorbant flooring, like tiles or linoleum - as with all animals, rabbits will make mistakes at first. In this confined area, in the corners you want to play several small litter trays over newspaper to catch any spills. As suggested, if you can, place something that has been soiled into the trays to reinforce the smell - however be careful with which wood you use, why is discussed below in the section on litter. Over time you will notice that your bunny will prefer one spot over another. As they start this preference, slowly remove the other trays one at a time. If they do have accidents in other spots, return the trays and start again. But its very likely your bunny will pick up on whats happening. Once they have a spot chosen, you can get a larger (more elborate) tray, and eventually they will imprint on the litter tray, rather than the area. This allows you to move the litter tray to a more convenient location, or if you need to leave your bunny with someone else the litter tray can go with to reduce mess. Rabbits are not cats and some litters designed for cats are not appropriate for rabbits. Above all else, softwood litters such as those based on pine or cedar must be avoided!. Safer choices include paper or hardwoods. Take time to find the right amount of litter for your rabbit, as they all have different preferences. Rabbits have larger and stronger legs than a cat, and a stronger urge to dig. This means that litter, especially used litter, can go flying. The best thing to minimise mess is to get a larger, deeper litter tray. Rabbits will often try to position themselves in a corner when relieving themselves, so positioning the opening in a way away from their chosen corner of the box will help reduce spillage. The below image shows an ideal rabbit litter tray:  Do not enclose the litter tray unlike in in nature, your bunnies litter tray is not a porous earthen enclosure with plants that enthusiastically absorb nitrogen. It is non-porous tray that needs to be emptied frequently and if left enclosed will allow nitrogen to build up. Rabbit pee can smell, so more often cleaning, or more absorbent litter is the answer. Enclosing the trya will just enclose the smell, and your rabbits nose is much more sensitive than yours, if the smell builds up too much they will just not go there, and will choose another place to go - like your bed. Rabbits occasionally suffer from excitement induced fecal incontinence, or cutely known as ""happy trails"". When excited, whether during positive experiences such you coming home, during feeding time, or new vistors, or negative experiences, such as for some rabbits, nail clippings, your bunny may release dropping pellets. This is outside of their control, and they will usally be very hard and dry, and easy to clean up. This is one of the joys of owning a rabbit. Rabbits are more comfortable in an area when they can eat. So add some hay to their litter box. This also helps to passively position the rabbit into a corner, as rabbits are quite clean and won't relieve themselves on their food. So by positioning the hay in one corner of the box, you encourage the rabbit to go in the opposite one. One a final (slightly off topic) note, as mentioned rabbit waste from a well fed bunny is very high in nitrogen. If you use a recycled paper based litter, the used litter is excellent fertilizer and can be used in the garden, for example to grow nice leafy green vegetables, to feed to your rabbit... thus completing the circle of life."
Are there health risks to leaving a dead fish in the aquarium?,"Assuming you're absolutely certain that the fish did not die from a disease or parasite (I'm not certain how you would ensure that, short of having absolutely nothing new introduced into the environment for an extended period of time prior to the death)... I would say it depends upon what died, and the other denizens of your aquarium. If you have a decent Clean Up Crew that will rather quickly consume the body, you're probably not going to run any serious risks of the body releasing enough toxins to jeopardize the other fish. If you lack sufficiently voracious cleaners, or your dead fish is on the largish side, you should pull it out of your tank sooner rather than later, though. Generally, at least among saltwater tank owners, leaving a dead fish for the CUC doesn't seem that uncommon."
What is the optimal age to neuter a male dog?,"For male dogs, it doesn't seem to matter. Some behaviours will respond to castration, others won't, no matter the age of the dog: Castration was most effective in altering objectionable urine making, mounting, and roaming. With various types of aggressive behavior, including aggression toward human family members, castration may be effective in decreasing aggression in some dogs, but fewer than a third can be expected to have marked improvement. Age of the dog or duration of the problem behavior does not have value in predicting whether castration will have a beneficial effect. (Neilson et al., 1997) For female dogs, however, it seems that spaying them to early is associated with an increased risk of urinary tract infections: Because earlyage gonadectomy appears to offer more benefits than risks for male dogs, animal shelters can safely gonadectomize male dogs at a young age and veterinary practitioners should consider recommending routine gonadectomy for client-owned male dogs before the traditional age of 6 to 8 months. For female dogs, however, increased urinary incontinence suggests that delaying gonadectomy until at least 3 months of age may be beneficial. (Spain et al., 2004) References"
Why does my cat wash her paws in her water?,"Have you seen your cat doing this? Cats don't usually use water to wash themselves - they'll use their own tongues, even when it's something really gross like litter. (I have seen cats washing actual feces off themselves with their teeth/tongues.)  If you haven't actually witnessed this ""washing"" behavior, it's more likely that your cat is dipping her paw in the water bowl to drink from it, which is a common cat behavior (even in cats that hate getting wet).  The litter getting into the water from the cat's paws is a byproduct of this behavior. Try a different brand of litter that might be less ""sticky"", or make sure that you are scooping the litter box frequently so it's nice and dry in there. I would be willing to bet that this problem will solve itself over time. Kittens are not notorious for their cleanliness, especially in the litter box. As the cat grows up she'll get better about keeping herself clean, and even if she still dips her paw in the water to drink, she'll make less of a mess."
How do I stop my dog from barking at people through the fence?,"This is a very tricky problem for the simple fact that your dog gets rewarded every time it barks at a passerby. In the dog's head, it's all very simple.  Person approaches, dog barks, person leaves. Yay to the power of barking!  Depending on the size of your garden, if none of TildalWave's suggestions are an option, you might have to temporarily keep your dog in the house while you're not at home and in a room that doesn't allow him to bark at passersby through the window. The long-term approach is to use desensitisation and counter-conditioning, that is, slowly get your dog used to strangers coming near the fence and start to associate strangers with good things happening(TM).  You'll have to recruit some strangers (to your dog) and ask them to approach the fence to a distance that your dog is comfortable with. Reward your dog for noticing the stranger but not barking at it. Slowly move the dog and/or stranger closer together and keep rewarding good behaviour. Try to set your dog up for success as much as possible. The less often you get your dog's threshold wrong, the quicker it'll learn.  Also, it is very important for the stranger not to move away if your dog does start barking, as this will only reinforce the unwanted behaviour. Just ask the person to stay still and move your dog further away from the fence. Most of all, exercise plenty of patience as it might take a while. "
Why does my cat like licking my armpits?,"Humans secrete a fair amount of salt when sweating and many animals, especially cats, are attracted to the taste of that for some reason. Another reason is, actually, scent. Your cat may be trying to apply their scent to you in, well, a fairly obvious spot for them to override.  A third reason is grooming. Cats will groom their human companions. This is a sign that they're quite relaxed and comfortable around you. As for health, well I can't say, except that I doubt it's dangerous if the antiperspirant is truly gone. You could look at citrus-based deodorants as a deterrent since your cat won't like the taste. Might sting a bit though...  "
How often is too often to bathe a dog?,"General Rule: Whatever the breed is, it is advisable not to bathe your dog more than once a month unless otherwise instructed by a vet using proper shampoo and soap.  If you bathe a dog too often, its coat will lose shine and the dog can become itchy. Also, dog has a natural coat protecting system which can get harmed by over-bathing. So, once a month is preferable. However, we bathe our German Shepherd twice a month and I haven't experienced anything problematic about it.  As far as the smell goes, it is very natural for a dog to have some smell. It should not bother you."
My friend is allergic to only some of my cats; why is that (and how do I mitigate for future cats)?,"Oddly enough, it could be the color of their fur. A study has shown that darker color cats are more likely to induce an allergic reaction: While the reason is unclear, researchers at Long Island College Hospital in New York speculate that darker cats may produce more of an allergen called fel d 1 in their skin and saliva than do lighter colored felines. A study of 321 patients found that those who owned dark-colored cats were up to four times more likely than those with light-colored cats or no feline friends to suffer moderate or severe allergy symptoms, according to a report to be published in the Annals of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. Then again, as is often the case with science, another study has reportedly found the exact opposite result.  There is a study titled Fel d 1 levels in domestic living rooms are not related to cat color or hair length, but I cannot find details of the actual study (possibly due to the current government shutdown).  It is possible that the previous study may have simply been too small, and insufficiently randomized, as the cohort was only 321 patients. According to yet another study, it is also possible that male cats may produce more fel d 1 than female cats, and intact males may produce more than neutered males. In any case, fel d 1 levels do seem to be the most likely culprit.  Since the hormone is secreted in saliva and from the sebaceous glands, it is most abundantly produced during grooming. To mitigate your friend's exposure, you can try to keep him away from areas where the cats are most likely to groom themselves."
How long can a healthy cat go without food?,"When I've had to change my cats' food and they resist, I mix the old and new foods, slowly adding more of the new food, until after a few weeks, all I'm serving is the new food. In the beginning, the cat will pick-and-choose the OldFoodBits and leave the NuFoodBits behind; but gradually he'll start eating more and more of the NuFood. And the transition will be less traumatic, less chance of damaging his health. And you can also see if the new food is really really something he Absolutlely Won't Eat, or just something he needs to slowly get used to. I know this doesn't answer the question in the heading - how long can a healthy cat go without food - but this might help you with the transition. (Kind of like how Ebay changed their page background from its original yellow, to white. First people shrieked, so Ebay turned it back. Then they made it a shade lighter every other day until it was white...and almost no one noticed.)"
How can I know if my cat is in pain?,"As Monica and Me123 have said, the big two signs of cat distress are: Other signs I've seen with various cats include:"
How can I permanently reduce the pH level of my aquarium?,"You should consider adding some natural pH reducing element. Adding drift woods, indian almond or oak leaves will slowly leach tannins, which in turn will reduce the pH. If you have a planted tank, you can start injecting CO2 which will also lower the pH. Another option is to filter the water through peat moss or commercially available peat granules."
How can cat owners protect cats from secondary poisoning from rodenticides?,"This isn't the answer that you're looking for, but the best way to prevent secondary poisioning from rodenticides is to keep your cats indoors.  Keeping your cats indoors protects against MANY problems that can make your cat sick or die! Cats who are either part-time or full-time allowed to roam outdoors alone face the following risks: Source: Indoor Cats vs Outdoor Cats If you're determined that your cat should be allowed outside, the best solution is to build a protected enclosure (often referred to as a ""catio""). There are a ton of resources online for how these can be built/bought, performing a google search for ""outdoor enclosure cat"" and ""catio"" turns up a lot of resources. "
How can I safely reintegrate 3 male dogs that have a history of fighting?,"Without knowing exactly what preceded each episode of neck shaking, this requires a little more caution in how this needs to be approached. If you had defining incidents that precipitated the behavior, these behaviors could be monitored, but in this case, all  behavior needs to be monitored. As you have successfully reintegrated them in the past, I won't focus too much on that, as opposed to preventing the neck shaking from reoccurring. Reintegration: To begin with the dogs should be safe to reintegrate on leash, by being in the same room for periods of time while under the supervision of their owners. This allows them to get used to being in each other's company without any more aggravating behaviors.  Gradually allowing them supervised time off leash, in each others company. Offering plenty of praise and distraction. The idea being, they will learn to be in each other's company without being focused on each other and even forgetting about each other. Prevention: The best way to prevent the neck shaking or other aggressive behavior is to nip all rough play in the bud. The dogs need to be allowed to meet and greet, the investigative sniffing, and can be rewarded for good behavior by being allowed off leash together. However any sign of rough play, mouthing, jumping on each other, the pug jumping up at the boxer, the boxer pawing the pug, any growling, must be met with firm vocal chatisation from the most suitable person present; there and then. A firm, deep and bellowing No! with the accusatory finger pointing at the offenders with continuous eye contact until the offenders (I put them in this basket together) both posture submissive stances with the owner.  Generally the adult mot likely to achieve an effective result in discipling dogs in this way, will be the one who will naturally react quickly to handle the situation, so it is not even something that needs to be clearly defined, who does the disciplining, but that there is some sort of consensus and consistency in how the dogs are disciplined. Possible causes: Dogs will naturally wrestle for dominance within a household, usually the hierarchy of dominance is established early on and this tends to remain the status quo (unless more dogs are introduced), however it does not prevent the lessor ranking dogs from wanting to push the boundaries from time to time, and in some cases the established hierarchy can be a little shaky and enforced without a convincing submission from the under dog. As a general rule for desexed males the older dog will be the most respected, a female will tend to boss over the males. I have noticed that the desexed males will tend to have more flux and tousles over dominance. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, usually this is not an issue, unless one dog decides he no longer wants to defer to the older dog. This is what I think may be happening here. Solutions for dominance:  As the boxer is the offending dog in this case and the younger and so, most likely, more trainable dog Your parents could try practicing a few techniques to reduce the dominant features their boxer is displaying. Although it is a good thing for a dog to be protective of it's humans, a dog can become a little overprotective, which can result in some over zealous or aberrant aggressive behavior. These are some simple techniques that can be used explained in thiese posts How can I stop my dog jumping at the table and mouthing my fingers? and here Why does my dog act differently outside the house?. It is worth mentioning that this is not outrageous behavior by dogs, by any means. Dogs can be prone to friction and they can't argue it out. Given your only want to bring the dogs together for 3-4 hours and that in the past, they had been together for a prolonged period before this neck shaking occurred, I'd be quote hopeful that you could integrate the three dogs for family gatherings, but I would not leave them unsupervised."
Cat behaving strangely for no apparent reason,"Every thing you say in your question makes me think your cat is in pain, urinating and defecating on the floor but sometimes using the litterbox (pain using the litterbox). Moving low to the ground, pain when walking (urinary tract infection pain). Does not want to leave the room, does not want to move as this causes pain. Does not want to go outside, not feeling well. All of this makes me think that this is not a reaction to fear of other cats or anything in the house. You need to take your cat to the vet as this is not normal for a six year old cat."
How do you clean poop out of a long hair cat's fur?,"To be honest, if you get most of the chunks out and blot the dampness up as much as you can, I'd let her clean the rest of it herself. Grooming is a self soothing activity, and since she doesn't know you, you cleaning her will stress her out. The exception would be if you know (or suspect) that she has a poop borne illness, and want to prevent the other cat from potential contamination. Make sure the room you confine her in is warm, and change her bedding every few hours until she gets it cleaned up. It's usually recommended to confine new cats to a small room (like a bathroom) for the first couple of days anyway, so in this case I would doubly recommend bathroom confinement."
How can we prevent our cats from scratching on our chair?,"You say that you have scratching posts around your house, but they may not be the right type. Cats have definite preferences for scratching surfaces, and something about that chair makes it ""better"" than the posts. For example, we had a cat who LOVED to scratch on our ottoman. We had plenty of posts, but eventually figured out that we didn't have one tall enough for him - he wanted to get a good long body stretch, so the post had to be about 3 feet tall. Once we added a post of that height, he rarely touched the ottoman again (instead of a daily thing it became something he did once a month or two). So, some things to consider: In addition, make sure to keep their claws trimmed. Even if they aren't scratching on your furniture on purpose, running and playing across the furniture can cause damage. An alternative to trimming (which may help while you're figuring out what kind of scratcher he wants) would be to use nail caps. He'll still make scratching motions on the furniture (so you can monitor your progress with finding the right scratcher) but it won't cause damage. You CAN have nice furniture even with cats! We have 4 cats and leather furniture. We occasionally get accidental scratches from running and playing, but nothing on purpose.  As a last note, declawing is NEVER recommended. Cats generally become more aggressive (especially biting) when you remove their claws because it's painful and you're taking away their defense mechanisms. In addition, as a declawed cat ages it will tend to develop arthritis on the paws which will make using a litter box painful, and cause an aversion to the litterbox. For more on the hazards of declawing, I recommend the Paw Project"
What can I do now that my cat is terrified of me after I broke up a fight involving her and two other pets?,"This is a very common question on this SE and it makes perfect sense. The cat for some reason is traumatised by your action. You might have stepped on his tail, or she might just be upset because you defended the dog. It doesn't necessarily mean you did something bad, it is just impossible to relay the reasons behind our actions to the cats. The good thing you need to know is that animals don't hold grudges. Even the most abused animals might start trusting their owner back, so I am very confident that your relation with your cat will be as good as it was before. Keep in mind that just like you are still shaken up, so is the cat. It might just be a few hours before she cools down, so there is a good chance you won't need to do anything. The most important thing is not to rush the process. Just like patching up your relation with a human, you need to give the animal some space. Starting with the treats was the best approach. Don't overindulge your cat with treats though because they will be detrimental to her health. You might want to refrain yourself from touching the cat. Ask for your cat's consent before you touch her by extending your finger to her nose. If she smells your finger, it means she allows you to touch her. Never pick her up until you fully regain her trust. Cats do not generally like being picked up. Do the lazy cat blinks. The meaning of lazy blinks is disputed whether it is a smile, kiss or just a statement of non-aggression, but whatever it is, it instils trust in the cat. Try to offer some toys from time to time. Keep your distance if your cat still distrusts you. I hope this helps."
"Why are cats released as part of ""spay and release"" programs?","Feral cats tend to stick to specific areas, and may form loose colonies with other local feral cats.  These colonies can range in size from a handful to dozens of adult cats, and, in the absence of concerted spay and release efforts, the size of the colonies tend to continue growing. Larger populations of feral cats in neighborhoods can become a real nuisance, with issues including noise (particularly when one or more females go into heat), food raids (garbage cans being tipped over, unguarded food snatched, etc.), and waste (gardens make good substitute litter boxes). When local cats are viewed as pests and nuisances, the likelihood of abuse from the human residents increase.  These cats are at risk of deliberate poisoning, getting shot, trapped in inhumane ways, or even torture. The idea behind spay and release is that you are allowing the animals to live out their lives in a way that gives them at least some chance of happiness, while putting a stop to the cycle of breeding to avoid more cats being born into the rather harsh conditions most feral cats put up with.  The gradual reduction in numbers reduces the pressure from the local environment on these animals, largely by making them less of a nuisance. People actively involved in spay and release programs frequently feed the feral cats in their neighborhood.  Their houses or businesses therefore tend to be areas where the local feral cat population will converge.  This makes it easier to keep track of which cats they've already captured and had ""fixed"", so if one is accidentally recaptured, they simply release it immediately instead of bringing it to the vet (unless they decide to bring the cat in for other medical reasons). If a cat that has already been fixed is captured/recaptured, a veterinarian will be able to ascertain this prior to committing to surgery. As thkala mentioned, there are issues with finding homes for feral cats.  Simply put, they tend to make horrible pets. My mother was active in spay and release with the local cats in her previous neighborhood, and the people who owned the house prior to her made a habit of feeding the neighborhood cats.  Over time, all but one of the local cats disappeared (presumably dead).  When she finally moved to a new house, she caught the remaining feral cat, and brought it with her (fearing that it had become overly dependent upon her providing food, which was not something she could guarantee the next owners of the house would continue). She still has this cat.  It lives in her basement, and hides in a storage area.  It does come out to interact with the domesticated cat they also have, but my mother almost never sees her (and when she does, it is just a quick glimpse as the cat runs and hides). Very few people want an animal like that living in their house, and therefore finding a home for individual animals, let alone an entire colony, is almost impossible. Many areas have charitable organizations dedicated to supporting the costs and logistics of spay and release programs.  These programs may offer live animal traps, assistance in finding local veterinary offices that will assist with spaying, or even vouchers to get the procedures done at a reduced cost.  Individual veterinary offices may also support the practice with discounted rates or other services. It is worth a quick search in your area to see if there are any spay and release organizations nearby.  "
How do I walk a small dog afraid of loud noises in an urban area?,"Because the dog is so young, I think it is very likely you can slowly accustom her to urban walking.  I think a natural response when you see a small dog cowering or wimpering in fear is to console them, or pet them.  This is not an effective way to dissuade fear.  It is better to ignore your dog and not feed into its fearful emotions. [see below] I think the best bet is to teach your dog that walking in urban areas is fun.  Bring treats and toys, walk in a zany unpredictable way, go for short burts of sprints, etc.  Your dog will eventually begin to associate urban walks with fun times and an owner in good spirits."
How to get my cat to stop being annoying at night?,"He's bored.  The first goal should be to make some place (not your bedroom) a much more entertaining place to be than your bedroom is. Set up some toys in your living room or some other place like a puzzle feeder, automatic wand toys, or other toys that he likes. In the morning these toys should be put away to keep his interest level in them up. Then, make your bedroom as uninteresting as possible. Put the pill bottles and jewelry away, don't respond when he steps on you, etc.  Last, take advantage of the cat's hunt, feed, groom, sleep cycle. Use an interactive toy for awhile right before bed, then give him some food. He should settle down pretty quickly after that (it works amazingly well on our youngest). Pam Johnson Bennett outlines this plan in more detail on her site."
Is it okay for an elderly cat to be sleeping in the litterbox?,"First, with any behavior change, you should take your cat to the vet to make sure there's no underlying health problem. After the vet has determined that the change is behavioral and not related to a physical problem, you can start to look at your cat's environment from his perspective to try to track down the change. Understand that cats are comforted by things that smell like them (they have a much stronger sense of smell than we do and it's much more important to their understanding of the world). The litter box is definitely a strong personal scent (even a ""clean"" litter box will retain some of the scent to a cat). So look around for things that may be causing stress for your cat. Some possibilities include: Once you have some ideas (or even if you don't!) there are some ideas that you can use to reduce your cats' stress level. If you can pinpoint a few things that could be causing stress, try ideas from the following list that are related. For example, if there's a new dog in the house, then installing elevated pathways (bullet 2) will help him avoid the dog and feel more secure in the house. To end this novel, I'll add that the first winter we had Cat Genies we found Kendall sleeping in one. They wash and blow dry the PVC litter-pellets, so we eventually figured out that he was cold and put a heating pad in a hidy-box. Now we know the weather is starting to turn cold because 3 of our 4 cats fight over who gets to be in the hidy-box (only 2 fit at a time). So, sleeping in the litter box is not always an insecurity thing. In our case, what changed was the litter box and the weather."
My cat mixes up the floors in my building. How can I help him?,"This is hard to answer. I think you will have to do some experiments. If your cat has a toy or object he likes, you might try to put this outside your door so he can smell his own scent to make him recognize he is at home. Cats in general do know their area by sight and by scent, There are many examples of cats living in an multi-apartment building and not having any  problems in finding the right door to where they live. I think one of the things you need to do is to visit the vet to see if your cat has any problems smelling or if it might have eye problems. This is to be sure it is not a physical problem. If nothing physical is wrong with your cat, you can try to mark your apartment by putting up a visual marker and/or a scent marker for your cat outside your door to help him locate his home. You can simply move the welcome mat from inside to outside your door or hang one of your cat's toys on the door so he can reach and smell it."
Is it harmful for my cat to eat bugs?,"In my experience, cats are pretty good determining whether something they've caught should be eaten - one of the cats I grew up with was an avid hunter but while he played with a rat that had eaten poison, he didn't try to eat it. The other cats I've lived with haven't been as eager to hunt but none of them ever tried to eat anything poisonous although they'd eat bugs quite cheerfully (including crunching down on grasshoppers). If you're not poisoning the bugs that get in, there shouldn't be a problem - but keep an eye out for venomous spiders that are common where you live. Your cat probably won't try to eat those, but hunting them could get the cat bitten, with ugly consequences.  Update for those who object to my offering the anecdotal evidence of having spent most of my 47 years living with at least one cat and those who think my lack of concern about cats eating insects is problematic:"
Why is my dog drinking his pee after he urinates inside?,"Why is my dog drinking his pee when he urinates inside? Dog's drinking urine can be a sign of a few different things: This answer is linked with this post How should I correct my dog when I catch him drinking his urine?.  The inside of your home is the den and pack animals naturally like to keep their dens clean. They will want to relieve themselves as far away as possible from where they eat and sleep. From wolfcountry.net During nursing the mother will clean the pups and stimulates them to urinate and defecate by licking the genital region. She swallows all of their excretions, keeping 
  the birthing area clean and odor-free.   In wolf packs the entire pack protects the mother and the den and help to raise the puppies. Given he doesn't do this when he is outside, I wouldn't regard it as a problem, per se, he is doing what comes naturally and cleaning up. Why a Dog Laps Its Own Urine One reason is that urine doesn't absorb into linoleum, tile or
  finished wood like it does into dirt, grass and concrete. It remains
  pooled on the floor, tempting the dog's curiosity. Another reason is
  that, while a dog may not be housebroken, it may still know that
  urinating inside is forbidden. It will lap up its urine to hide the
  evidence. Conclusion: You've stated your dog came from a reputable breeder, implying he was well cared for as a pup; so it's unlikely this is caused from the syndrome of dogs in confined spaces learning to eat and drink their own waste. Given the information that it only happens when you forget to take him out at night or when  go to bed early (so he has to hold on longer overnight) I would say it's just your dog trying to fix up fix mishap and no great problem. My suggestion is that the cause of the problem sounds like:"
Cooling a goldfish tank during summer,"Well, you didn't say so, but I assume you have a thermometer inside your tank, don't you? Or did you measure the temperature using a portable, temporary one? Since your tank is inside your house, it's not directly at sunlight, perhaps some breeze was on it, etc. For the solutions, since it only happens few times a year, I'd go with ice cubes of pre-treated water, or as Baarn suggested, water that you have taken from your aquarium (although it might get... smelly... when you freeze and unfreeze it, since you´ll be killing some bacteria). Since they won't have chemicals that are harmful for your fish, it can be used without problems. Since some energy input is required to transform ice to water, the ice will ""steal"" this energy from the water, cooling all the tank. And due to convection, the cold water around the ice cube will flow to the bottom of the tank, and the warmer water will flow to the top, get in contact with the ice cube, and doing a cycle. You'd just need to make things slow (so you won't be changing the water temperature too fast, causing some cold shock on your fish). The thermometer will be your friend here."
How can I deionize water to prevent brown eye stains on my dog?,"The iron in your water is present in two forms.  The majority of it is iron (III) oxide, also known most commonly as rust.  The second is ionized iron, which is Fe2+. Iron oxide is insoluble in water, and if enough of it is present (usually happens in well water) then the water will start to have a brown/orange tinge.  It is not filtered by Brita filters.  They use activated carbon filters which will not filter out iron. Reference for this. See section called 'What Activated Carbon doesn't do' Fe2+ is usually not present in in high quantities in water, as it is a rare form of iron, and in drinking water it is not stable and precipitates into iron (III) hydroxide, which is also insoluble and rust colored. Reference.  There still some remaining though. To fully filter out the ionized iron and the solid iron, you need a system that oxidizes the ionized iron and a filter (sediment filters are fine) to get the particles that become oxidized or were already present.  More information here. This is all very complicated and can be expensive though (unless you just want to buy a sediment filter, which can be 10-15 dollars). A less expensive option would be to buy a large jug of water at a grocery store that was treated by reverse osmosis, as this removes most of the iron.  Make sure you check out the standards of the brand you are buying though, because some filter out more things than others."
Why do cats love sleeping on cardboard?,"This has to do with security. A box has 4 sides so they feel safe and protected since they are closed off. It also gives them the element of surprise and if anything happens they can easily escape/attack etc. (src) They like the security of an enclosed space. A box resembles a cave and may make your cat feel secure knowing they are protected and, theoretically, cannot be attacked from behind. Boxes are fun! Lots of cats seem especially playful in and around boxes. Cats enjoy jumping in and out of a box, pouncing, stalking and climbing atop boxes. Cats are little predators, and a box is a great spot from which to pounce on their prey, even if the prey is just a catnip mouse toy. Boxes are cozy. Try putting a soft blanket in the bottom of your cat’s favorite box. The sides help retain the cat’s body heat making a comfy nest. (src)"
Cat has bad tooth and won't eat but vet won't remove tooth if she isn't eating,"As someone with 5 cats, one of whom recently lost a lower front tooth, I'd be inclined to get a 2nd opinion from a different vet. My reasoning is that she can't eat anything because of the pain in her mouth. She can't drink anything because of the same problem (unless you can get her to try warm water), so how is she to ""get healthy"" enough for the extraction? After the extraction, I would think your cat would be more happy to chow down and not be in pain. Plus, your vet making your cat suffer for another 7 days is very stressful for her (and you). That's just not right."
Is it a responsible action to adopt a starving kitten when I live in a very small place?,"First question is, do you want a cat? If not, disregard the rest of my comment and say no. I'm inclined to agree with your friend, although I do understand your reservations. If the situation the kitten is currently in involves potentially starving to death - any kind of living area where they are not starving is much more preferable. Consider how you would feel if the same situation applied to you. Of course in the future, the cat may ""grow out"" of your living area, but at least it will be alive. You could always rehome to someone with a bigger house, or the cat could be so grateful for saving its life it won't be too bothered. Also, cats live a long time, you might move in to a bigger place during its lifetime. "
Safe for cats to drink from the aquarium?,"Here are the main problems in my mind: I'd first put a lid or covering on the tank to stop the direct access that the cat already has. If this isn't possible because the filter would still be exposed, you can try training your cat not to go there. If the cat really only likes running water, you can also get it a drinking fountain (This is the first one I found online - YMMV). The cat will be able to drink from a running water source without needing to disturb the aquarium."
Did I Traumatize My Puppy?,"That was probably a little too much in one go for a puppy. Puppies learn natural dog behavior from their mothers and rudimentary human behavior from their mother's owners (that's called socializing). They are most trusting and confident in situations they experienced in a positive way during socializing. Everything above and beyond makes them insecure until they learned how to cope with the new situation. After such a negative experience, you need to give your puppy much love and, if possible at all, repeat the same or a similar situation in a much more positive way. First there was cutting the nails. This is not an activity you usually do with a puppy during socialization and holding the feet of a dog is not part of the natural behavior. Almost all dogs get nervous during nail cutting at first and need to be trained to endure the procedure in a calm way. You should train ""holding hands"" with your puppy. He can be sitting up or lying on his side (to hold the feet). Just pet him a little, take one of his feet in your hand, look at it and move it a little bit for 5 - 10 seconds, then release it and continue petting. This connects the experience with positive emotions. Next you should include the nail clipper in this training. Let your dog sniff at it, then do the ""holding hands"" training but instead of just holding his feet, touch his nails with the clipper. You don't need to actually clip his nails, just touching is enough. Continue petting after that. Next time you need to cut his nails, repeat the same training, this time actually cutting his nails. Pet him after every single nail that was cut. Next the bath. Many dogs are afraid of the bathtub because they cannot see the shape of the surface clearly, it makes a metallic sound that most dogs aren't used to and amplifies sounds and on top of that, they get wet. You could compare the experience with a ghost train for dogs. Some simple tips to make the experience less frightening are: Getting water into a dog's ear can cause ear infections, so avoid that at all costs. Even plain, clean water without shampoo will significantly raise the risk of an infection. Always use a shampoo designed for dogs. Shampoo for humans shouldn't be ingested, can dry out a dog's skin for several weeks and cause itching or rashes. Once you're done, either let your dog jump out of the tub or lift him out. Offer a towel in your open hands and call him to you. Rub him dry in a playful manner. Our dog loves to rub himself on the towel and squirm around on it. Last but not least, the ears. I share your fate in that regard. Any ear infection is extremely unpleasant for a dog, and so is getting any liquid into their ears. Our own dog whines as if he's being slaughtered every time we treat his ears. Don't grab your dog by the snout and force his head into the position you'd like. Don't clamp his head between your legs. This is not only a form of violence, it also means a rather severe punishment in a dog's natural body language. That way you connect treating his ears with very negative emotions and he will fight harder and harder against it. Instead, you need to have more patience and outsmart him. You should start massaging his ears with your non-dominant hand. In case of an infection, it's best to massage from the cheek (inner ear) towards the neck (outer ear) to dislodge any accumulation of ear wax. If there is excessive ear wax, it's best to wipe it out with a moistened cotton swap before applying any medication. Do not use Q-tips / cotton buds in a dog's ear. Then move your dominant hand (holding the medication bottle / dispenser) to the same ear and quickly squirt some of the medication in the ear. Continue massaging the ear to spread the medication. If the medication is very liquid, you don't even have to aim. It'll flow into the ear while you massage. If it's more like a gel and your dog won't let you aim in his ear, squirt a dose onto your finger tip and gently push the finger as deep into the ear as you can get, then massage. Be careful not to hurt your dog with your finger nails. After each treatment, give him some very special treats he doesn't get every day and praise him."
What level of output laser pointer is safe for a cat?,"This article from Princeton University deals with laser pointer use and human effect, and it mentions that use of laser pointers that are higher than 5 mW are dangerous and should not be used, so it seems like the green one might be safe, although they recommend that the lower the output the better, as they will be safer. Like with any laser, avoid pointing it at your cat's eyes, or at reflective surfaces that might reflect the laser into their eyes, and that can cause problems, the same way it can for humans.  Further, though, beyond just the output, another concern is that since the cats cannot ""kill"" the laser, they are not able to come down from the ""high"" of hunting, and may redirect that energy in negative ways (excessive grooming, aggression, etc), so it is suggested that at the end of a laser pointer play session, you give the cat something to ""kill"" such as a stuffed toy or something similar. "
Is it possible to have a pet cat even with cat allergies?,"It's definitely possible to live with a cat even if you have cat allergies. There are several things you can do to reduce, and remove the allergens that cause a reaction. Step one is always fresh air, ventilation, and filtration. Open windows when you can to get fresh air flow moving through the house, bring in new air and take away the old with dander and other allergens. If you can't have the windows open all the time, like if it rains or gets cold outside, you can use an air filter like Oldcat suggested (Technically you can use one all the time I guess, but come on, fresh air!). Here is an example air filter. Though I have no idea how good this one is, it has a 4 1/2 star rating. You can always give the cat its own space so that your wife has places to be safe from any reactions. The bedroom is a perfect place to make into a safe room. You should be able to spend time with your cat whenever you want, but in the case of an allergic reaction, your wife should have a place to get away. Brush the cat often to get rid of shed hair and dander. Also, brush it outside if you can, or in a well ventilated room. You're brushing the allergens off of the cat and into the air, which is something you definitely don't want. Furniture and upholstery are allergen traps. You can either clean them often, or you can put allergen protectors on them. My wife is allergic to dust mites, so we have a mattress cover on our bed. I will warn you they make crinkling sounds when you move on them. They make anti-allergen sprays that are supposed to remove even pet allergens, though I can't say the effectiveness of those, it might be something to look into. Watch your vacuum. Old vacuums with bags are especially notorious for kicking back some dirt and dust. You can get allergen trapping bags, but newer, bagless vacuums are much better. Keep the litter box clean. Not only is cat urine an allergen, but cat litter is extremely dusty. You might want to try different kinds of cat litter to see if that helps. Yesterday's News is made of old newspaper, and Feline Pine is made of compressed sawdust. Keep the cat clean. While cats will wash themselves, they will not get rid of all their dander on their own. Also, cat saliva is an allergen too (go figure). I personally don't suggest daily baths; especially for kittens. But a bath once a week or so would help. Daily wipe downs with a cloth or kitten wipes are an alternative to baths, and can be less stressful on both of you. Important notes:  
Finally, I would suggest you get treatment -- Even if it's just taking antihistamines to reduce the allergic reaction. There's also the option of getting an allergy test to tell what specifically you're allergic to. That can help you target the allergens more effectively.  You will want to speak to a doctor about immunotherapy for the details but I can tell you this much: It will not cure allergies. What it does, is it gets your body used to the allergens. Desensitizing your body to the reaction and lessening the immune system's response. Your wife still might have allergic reactions after the treatments are completed, but the point is that they're so minuscule she won't hardly notice. First thing to do is understand what an allergy is. At the basic level, an allergy is the body reacting negatively to an otherwise harmless substance. What immunotherapy aims to do, is expose the immune system to the allergen in minute amounts at first, then slowly increase the dosage until you no longer feel the effects. The process does take time, so don't expect it to be done anytime soon. The treatment goes something like this: You will go in once a week for a mall dose at first, then once every other week, then once a month, then once every few months, then once a year, then once every couple years. The dosage increasing by a fraction each time. Because there are so many treatments, it can be fairly costly, but I cannot give an estimate with any confidence. I will say immunotherapy has been shown to be an effective method of managing allergies. If you and, more importantly, your wife are patient enough, it will help her manage the allergic reactions.

Can I use a gecko to get rid of a cockroach infestation?,"If I read your question right, you want to use the gecko to clean up the poisoned roaches? You'll just end up with a poisoned gecko that way. But either way, a free-roaming gecko isn't going to make a dent in your roach problem, because roaches go out of their way to live and breed in places that predators can't reach, and to be honest the population is probably more than large enough to sustain itself even with minor losses from poison or predation. Plus, roaches tend to live within a few meters of their food supply, and letting reptiles run around your kitchen increases your risk of catching salmonella from them. It sounds like you have a pretty bad infestation, which unfortunately is not going to be easy or quick to get rid of. There's never a silver bullet for any kind of infestation, and you need to look at everything that's encouraging the roaches to settle in your kitchen: how new ones come in, where they're getting their food and water, where they're hiding and breeding, and so on. This approach is called integrated pest management (IPM), and it's the most effective response to any vermin problem. It's perfectly reasonable to hire a professional exterminator who understands IPM in a case like this (and I'd personally be skeptical of any exterminator who doesn't)."
How long can a 1-year-old cat stay home alone?,"It's not really about age once they get past 6 months, and it depends on him. If he's the reclusive sort that doesn't want or expect a lot of attention, you can have a friend come over daily to make sure he's got food and water and a little play time, and tend to the litter box as it needs it. It's good to have feeding systems that store enough for a couple of days no matter what, you never know when something might come up. If he craves attention and actively seeks it, you probably don't want to leave him at home alone for a protracted amount of time, or no longer than twice the length of time you'd normally be gone. That could be quite a bit of stress on him, and that can lead to undesirable things. He'll need a couple visits each day you're away. If you don't have a friend that you trust with a key, consider a good cat kennel where he'll have plenty of room and opportunity to interact and play with people. Just check them out first, the best ones are those that come recommended by other cat owners you know. "
Why do rabbits chew electrical wires?,"They have to chew. Rabbit teeth are constantly growing and the chewing activity actually serves to grind them down. Rabbits will chew pretty much anything ""chewable"" which includes wood, wires, and the like. If you give them lots of non-wire stuff to chew, like apple tree branches, then it does reduce the chance they'll go after your wires, but it doesn't stop it in my experience (we had two rabbits once). One good option, by the way, is the plastic teething keys you can get for babies. Not only do rabbits like to chew on them, but they also toss them about for play. Our rabbits loved the plastic keys."
Why is it not common for cats to be taken for walks?,"I use a leash and harness with my cats to let them outside, but I don't take them for a walk as I would with a dog. It's more letting them explore around the yard as much as they want, but controlling how far they go, and when they come back. They're not interested in walking around the block because they don't really like meeting strangers outside of the house, as they're already nervous from leaving the known safety of the house. I also don't want to take them outside of the yard because I don't want to have to deal with finding out what happens if they meet a dog. They've already had some bad experiences with dogs, so I'd rather keep them away as much as possible. The only types of cats that really do enjoy walking around the block are cats that are still relatively wild, like Bengals and Servals. They still have strong instincts to patrol/mark a broader territory than normal housecats, along with having higher amounts of energy. Servals are rarely seen as pets due to the legal restrictions on them, and Bengals are generally kept by owners who care more about how they look than how happy they are, so the chances of you happening across an owner walking their cat is almost none. The only reason I like to take my cats outside to explore is for the fresh air, really. It's mental stimulation, the same reasons people want to get out of the house: it gets boring after so long. It's just nice to see something different every once in a while. Sure, it's a bit of exercise for them too, but it's not the only way they can get exercise. They are smaller than most dogs, meaning they have more room to run around without knocking into things (most of the time). But really the main difference is that they can climb. I have a 6 foot tall cat tree that my cats can climb up and down, which gives them vertical space to exercise."
Are cats appropriate pets if I am not home for most of the day?,"The short answer: ""Yes"" The longer version: cats are generally pretty independent creatures, but they do miss their humans especially if we're not at home during the day. If you have just one cat, be prepared to be met with demands for attention, playing, and a great deal of petting when you are home. This will be strongest after you get the cat, because it won't be sure that you're coming back until gets used to your work routine.  Some of the things you can do to help are: "
Are there any special considerations when taking in a stray cat?,"There are several considerations: Health: A top priority is a visit to the vet to check for any health issues (illness, parasites) and get any immediately-needed vaccines (your vet will advise on this).  The vet should also check for a microchip; if for any reason the vet can't check this, call a local shelter and ask where you can have the cat checked. Do not allow the cat to interact with any other pets in your house before being cleared for health issues by a vet.  When I adoped a stray from the street she lived in the basement for a few days, well-separated from everybody else -- not much fun for her, maybe, but better than living on the street or potentially infecting my other cats with something contagious. Try to find the owner, if one exists and wants to be found: I mentioned checking for a microchip above; other things you can do, as JoshDM mentioned in his answer, are checking for and posting lost-pet notices.  It's also useful to call all local shelters and the animal-control division of local government to report the found cat.  An owner who's lost a pet will be calling those places, so this maximizes chances of you finding each other. House prep: If these are their first cats, they'll need to do the ""cats 101"" stuff -- food, litterbox, removing (or putting away) household hazards, etc.  That's beyond the scope of this question. Integration: If there are other pets in the house, follow the usual practices for gradually introducing the newcomer to them.  (I answered a related question about moving house here; I can't find a general ""how to introduce cats to each other"" question.)  If the cat is feral (as opposed to one who was previously a pet) things can be more complicated; see here for some advice."
"What causes fur clumps on my cat's back, and how can I prevent them?","These are generally called Mats. They are particularly a problem with long haired cats, but short haired cats can get them too. They are more susceptible to them in the spring and fall when they are shedding their seasonal coats. Also, overweight cats might get them in parts they can't easily reach to groom (i.e. their back). Prevention is quite simple, just brush your cat regularly and they are unlikely to occur. The main goal is to facilitate shedding. I'd recommend a strong wire brush (often called a cat rake) for this, for example something like:  The reason for this sort of brush is that it gets into their undercoat where mats generally develop. So when brushing your cat with this you want to be fairly aggressive (which they tend to like). The other advantages of regular brushing are that your cat will most likely love it, they will shed less (if your cat is indoors), santization (brushing out dirt / cat litter) and it will help prevent hairballs as well.  As far as what causes them I am not entirely sure, but I think it is probably similar to ""Why do cords always end up getting tangled?"" "
My cat loves coconut oil. Is it safe to give him some?,"Coconut oil is safe for cats, if given in moderation. Potential side effects include: Since you've been letting your cat have small amounts without any allergic reactions, I would think it is safe to assume that he is not allergic. Coconut oil has many benefits for cats and can be used internally or topically for a wide range of reasons: Topical Internal How much? The research that I've done suggests 1/8 to 1/2 teaspoon once or twice daily. Here's the catch, extra virgin coconut oil contains 92% saturated fat, or 117 calories per tablespoon, 14g fat and 12g saturated fat. This is a high-calorie supplement. If your cat has existing weight issues, or if he gains weight, it may become necessary to cut back, or reduce his caloric intake elsewhere. As with anything, if you see any side effects, stop immediately and consult with your local vet.

How can I stop my inside cat from being irritated by other outside cats or animals?,"You need to add a relatively tall climbing tree (the number one answer to almost anything related to cats) or similar high-up vantage point near the window and instead of closing the curtains I'd let a view to the outside from this tree. Closing the curtains forces your cat to go on the windowsill where s/he is then suddenly too close to the passerby. Having the window glass between them makes no difference, as you've noticed. Provide your cat with the high-up observation platform with a good view to keep watch over the ""intruder"" while the cat itself can stay invisible (or at least feel like invisible). How this might work depends a lot on the reason what really upsets your cat in the first place. Usually it is the close proximity to the passerby, which is quite unavoidable if the cat sits on a windowsill and the intruder moves right under your cat's nose. Stealth is life! What changes between night and day is the lighting. During a day the brightest light comes from outside, which makes it very difficult from the outside to see in. An animal passing the window at daytime can't really see in, so it can't make eye-contact with your cat. Your cat is invisible because of the glass reflection. Night changes this. An animal on the outside can see your cat so close on the windowsill and makes eyecontact. In case there is an outside lightsource that shines through the window illuminating your cat as well as the outside creature, then a roll-down curtain might help by shadowing your cat out of view. Like this:  Update:
From what I've later understood of the setting, it seems the above pic is not quite what your basement apartment looks like. If I got it right, the relation of ground level to window looks like this:  For the happiness of the cat I would not try to prevent access to the windowsill, as cats seem to like to sit and watch things through a window. I would turn the window into a one-way-mirror to the outside, which adds some darkening effect to the inside. Making it one-way to outside allows you (and your cat) to see out, but from the outside it appears to be a mirror. I don't know what the product is called in English, but it is a thin foil-like adhesive film that is spread on the window glass. Though there's no guarantee that this would work, but at least it would prevent eyecontact between your cat and the by-passing animal, as I believe that is an important part of the problem. The get a full mirror-effect requires that there's some light on the outside and relatively dark in the room inside."
Why is my cat growling at his toys?,"Cats growl when they grapple with their prey. Your cat is just playing, which in cats is just following their natural predatory instincts.
  Source : Why does my female cat hiss and growl over furry toys? In addition to this, I suggest that you do not try to pet him or stop him when he is doing this. If you do, he might think you're trying to take his ""prey"" away from him and can become aggresive towards you."
How can I encourage my kitten to leave my adult cat alone?,"The solution has two parts. First, tire out the kitten so she's less likely to view the adult cat as a plaything.  Wand toys like Da Bird are pretty effective for most cats (though I have one who prefers snake toys, so we have a wand toy with a feather boa instead of a ""bird"" attached for him). Second, make sure that the older cat has enough pathways to escape the younger cat's advances without getting cornered. You want to make sure that there aren't any ""dead ends"" in your house, and where there are dead ends, generally add vertical shelving/trees to enable the older cat to escape UP and continue getting away instead of having to face the younger cat.  In a similar situation we've also belled our youngest so that the older cats can easily find him.

Jackson Galaxy also has a great show on Animal Planet (and Netflix), My Cat from Hell, that may be able to help. Good luck!"
How can I keep my cat stimulated when she's stuck inside the house during winter?,"There are a lot of toys on the market designed to stimulate cats who are stuck in indoor environments, and usually they are designed to mimic behaviours that cats use outside and in the wild, etc. Some suggestions you might want to try that don't involve buying possibly expensive toys that your cat might not like are:"
Why does my cat (almost) constantly purr while he's awake?,"The language of purring Cats also purr if they're injured, while giving birth - even when dying.  British zoologist Desmond Morris has observed that  purring is ""a sign of friendship - either when the cat is contented with a friend or when it is in need of friendship - as with a  cat in trouble. (1) A cat's purr is a type of language, as is the meow. The meow tends to be a more intense expression than a purr. Although purring can also have emotion effect on cat owners. Purring doesn't always indicate a cat is content, it can mean a variety of things. (2)  At the very least it is a way of displaying submissive as opposed to aggressive intention.  German ethologist and cat behaviourist Paul Leyhausen interpreted the
  purr as a signal that the animal is not posing a threat. (3) Purring and attachment Even if you're across the room, your cat is still communicating with you, and being affected by your presence, which is probably reassuring for him. An interesting test would be to film him while you're out of the house. It could be his way of maintaining a connection with you. It is theorized that kittens and mother cats use purring as a way of bonding and that this may be a form of communication used throughout a cat's life to facilitate bonding.  Kittens are able to purr from a few days after birth. They can purr
  while suckling from their mother which may communicate contentment or
  maintain contact with her. ... Mother cats may also purr while nursing kittens, perhaps >to  maintain contact with their offspring. Or maybe it’s all down to the
  hypothalamus detecting a pleasurable sensation and helping to trigger
  purring. (3) Possible emotional damage of rescue pets Contrary to the prevailing view, there is evidence that emotional pain may induce greater suffering than physical pain. Studies have shown that emotional factors weigh more strongly in animals’ behavioral choices than physical pain. (4) Although it has yet to be determined what the long term effects of psychological or emotional suffering can be; it is becoming more apparent that a history of emotional abuse or neglect may well have lasting effects on a pet's psychology. Given you got him from the shelter, it might be a huge relief for your cat to have found you, and this could result in him being extra purry. He may well have an underlying insecurity, without knowing his history, he may have been happy with another owner and then suddenly removed, this is conjecture, but the fact he ended up homeless, means he's been uprooted. It would be hard to provide a definitive explanation as to why your cat purrs so much.  What we know for sure is that animals do suffer psychological and not just physical pain, and that emotional abuse and maltreatment may be far more widespread and pernicious than physical abuse. (5) The many articles I've linked discuss the variable nature of purring. If your cat is in good physical health and as settled as he sounds, it doesn't sound like something to be concerned about. As for something else going on in terms of physical health, there is some discussion about possible physical health issues that can cause (perceived) excessive purring.

How can I make one of my two cats eat less?,"Instead of forcing the lean cat to eat in a ""prison"", like a carrier box or a closed room, you could take advantage of the fact that the fat cat is just that; fat. Can he jump as high up as the lean one? Can he fit through a hole so tiny that the lean cat is just able to wiggle through? Find such place in your home that only the lean cat can jump onto, and put the food bowl up there. Show the place to the lean cat, so it'll know where to find food. The fat cat can't get there; problem solved. Example of a cat's ability to jump and climb:

(This animated gif is found in several pages in internet, I don't know whom to credit for it.) I currently have this situation with our cats. We have five cats, the youngest of which is overweight. I feed four of the cats on kitchen counter. This one cat is not willing to jump even this much, a relatively low (85 cm/34 inches) height for a cat, but simply waits on the floor until I give him the leftovers after the other cats have all eaten."
Why is my cat so interested in me making the bed?,"I cannot provide a definitive explanation. I only have my own anecdotal assumptions. I have always assumed that the cats which do this are motivated by their prey drive and their ""need"" to hunt & stalk. Cats differ as to how they express this need.  A common way people experience a cat's  prey drive is as an obsession to chase a dangling piece of string. A more elaborate cat toy designed to stimulate this same impulse are the wand toys such as ""Da Bird"" (example pic below).    Media figure Jackson Galaxy advocates regular ""play therapy"" with your cat(s) in order to satisfy what he considers an innate need to hunt.  I tend to agree with this advice, though I don't know if it has ever been investigated (verified) in a formal fashion. When you make the bed, the cats can be attracted by the sheets flying through the air and attempt to pounce on and catch them. Another motivation can be either to explore or hide in the small ""burrow"" created when they get underneath the sheets. Whether a cat is playing or hunting when they do this does not strike me as something worth debating.  It is likely different elements of each for different cats. I have several cats, but only one of them is especially interested in ""playing"" when I am trying to make the bed. I find it extremely annoying. (I also really miss it the occasional times he does not do it.) "
How can I keep my cats safe in my car?,"When transporting cats in carriers, I always put the crates in the back seat of the car and run the seat belt through the handle on the top and around the side of the crate. Like with children, the back seat is safest for cats and other pets, not only physically in event of a crash, but also limiting distraction to the driver (as when I have the crate in the front seat I often look over and talk to my cat).  I would think that the airbag deploying on a crate wouldn't be a good thing since it deploys with enough force to break bones in a human, and could potentially crush the crate.  Putting the crates on in the hatchback wouldn't be optimal, since the crates could slide around and tumble in event of a crash since they aren't secured by anything. Belting the crates with the seat-belt as explained above would be the best bet to reduce the risk to your furry friends.  Many dog and cat carriers have a slot for seatbelt on both sides of carrier topside."
How can I ensure that homemade dog food is healthy for my dog?,"Dogs are not pure carnivores and so do need a certain percentage of vegetable matter in their diet, but the majority of the diet should still be meat and with a little variation in the type of meat. About 20% of the remainder of the diet should have some vegetables in it. From the meat perspective, you want to have a decent mix of organs, muscle, skin and fat roughly in proportion to what they'd get from prey or scavenging. The meat that you use, though, should be meat that is fit for human consumption (even if we don't want to eat it). The vegetable mix can include things like squash, lettuce, carrots, cabbage, and similar, don't use carbs.   A good source for more detail, along with some recipes to help you get started at Dog Training Central or at Know Better Pet Foods. As with any diet, you should very carefully monitor the health of your friend as you transition his diet, pay particular attention for any signs of gas, vomiting, or other unusual behaviour such as lethargy."
Is there benefit to feeding my cats cat food that incorporates fruits and vegetables?,"Most of the relevant work seems to indicate that the nutrients found specifically in vegetables/fruits aren't digestible by cats, and the nutrients that they need are found in animal tissue (usually muscle or fatty tissue). So the inclusion of these ingredients in their food is not poisonous, but adds indigestible mass that they don't need. For example, in The carnivore connection to nutrition in cats (JAVMA, Vol 221, No. 11, December 1, 2002) Dr. Debra L. Zoran states: Vitamin A is found naturally only in animal tissues, and it must be
  provided as the biologically active form in diets formulated for cats
  because of the fact that cats cannot convert β-carotene (which is
  plentiful in plants) to retinol (the active form of vitamin A); this
  conversion is not possible, because cats lack the necessary intestinal
  enzyme. In high enough levels, being unable to digest some materials can actually be harmful to the cat. For example, benzoic acid is one of the components in cranberries (a popular fruit to add to cat food because of its folklore status as a cure for urinary tract infections in humans). Too much benzoic acid can be fatal for cats. Outbreaks of poisoning affecting 28 cats have followed ingestion
      of meat containing 2.39% benzoic acid. The effects were nervousness,
      excitability, and loss of balance and vision. Convulsions occurred and
      17 cats either died or were killed. Autopsies showed damage to
      intestinal mucosa and liver. The sensitivity of the cat may be due to
      its failure to form benzoyl glucuronide and toxicity may develop with
      quantities greater than 0.45 g/kg single doses or 0.2 g/kg repeated
      doses (Bedford & Clarke, 1971). However, you'd have to feed your cat a LOT of cranberries to get to this level of toxicity, so I don't believe your cat would be in any danger from a commercially produced food that included cranberry. Cranberries are somewhat of an unusual case. Their inclusion is often to promote urinary health, not just to increase the ""nutritiousness"" of the food. Skepvet summaries his findings: There is weak theoretical justification for using cranberry products
  for UTIs, though none of the supporting preclinical evidence involves
  dogs or cats. There is conflicting clinical trial evidence in humans,
  and no clinical studies in dogs and cats. There are weak theoretical
  safety concerns. Peas and pumpkin can also be included not for nutritional value, but to bulk up the stool and relieve constipation. I don't generally recommend feeding fiber to an otherwise healthy cat and prefer to monitor the situation myself. GI symptoms can be the first sign of an illness, so I prefer to know as soon as possible that something may be wrong. "
What can I do about the black dots on my cat's chin?,"This looks and sounds like something known as feline acne.   Basically, they're blackheads, or clogged pores. We have one cat who suffers from this.  She commonly gets black spots on her chin, lips, and muzzle, although the underneath of the chin is were we see most of them.  The veterinarian identified the spots as acne, and suggested that we try switching from plastic bowls to metal or porcelain.  He also suggested wiping them with a warm, wet rag, which generally seems to work. I've seen some disagreement about exactly what causes this.  Some suggested causes I've seen are stress, hormones, allergic reactions to plastic bowls, hygiene, or an overactive sebaceous gland. Its definitely worth taking your cat to the veterinarian, for a professional opinion.  Even if it is feline acne, the blackheads can become infected, or may be associated with other problems."
How do I help my dog with major leash anxiety?,"how is it going? Your description makes me think of a dog that might have been a nice, even beloved homebody dog who developed into an unmanageable training drop-out so that his owners despaired of being able to keep him - and hoped to give him a chance with somebody else. Supposedly he knows some training 'helpers', starting with stopping when he pulls and trying to get the leash out of his mouth by pulling - so he was given every chance and time enough to find his antidote for any of those methods - probably without ever understanding what kind of behaviour they wanted from him - and that it might bring him some kind of success he finds attractive in his situation, if would only he choose another option than pulling/holding/shaking. Later on I would think they probably tried to correct him by some rather more desperate kind of punishment - seemingly not connected (by him) with his owners actions but with the leash situation/strangers (you possibly know, what's in the market)-for me that could explain his fearful body signals when on leash with anybody else, his shaking and so on.  Not Dominance, but bad outcome of some training experiments during his impressionable younger years. What to do? Would first try to teach him to heel at home without collar and leash (not to trigger the 'old' behaviour again by them and not get him fixated on grabbing the leash again (which keeps his neck safe from most kinds of leash punishments at least he might have learned). Because of possible earlier trainings issues I would never use 'normal' signals for any training with him - not to remind him of earlier errors but use foreign language ones or/and unusual body signs, use praise and high value treats/play for any nearness to heel position (no command, not even a 'signal' or lure, just waiting what happens with a friendly dog when You walk around the home without any distractions and talk to him some friendly nonsense...  Just 'golden' the position near your leg (might choose the right instead of the usual left - reason the same as above: completely unrelated new training usually much easier to introduce than any changing of old habits/expectations). If he gets the idea, You might slowly add the first distractions and later on a new collar (still no leash) and then look for an qualified APDT-Trainer to help you get it 'on the street'... Who am I? A dog trainer from another country with university degree - noticeable not in English - and decades of experience with normal and correction work in a soft way."
Why does my dog's leg shake/twitch when I scratch certain spots on her body?,"You are eliciting a Scratch Reflex* that is located in the animal's spinal cord.  The urge to itch is involuntary. As for the ""smiling"" aspect, I don't know how that relates to the scratch reflex, but I can only surmise that it's similar to a minor grimace that a human might have while they are stretching their muscles. *Warning, skip the article if you are sensitive to descriptions of animals being used in research "
"Dog likes walks, but is terrified of walk preparation","Please consider that the problem might not be the harness itself, but how you act with the harness. Chihuahuas are small dogs and can be slinky when they want to avoid something. If you grab her, lift her up and somehow force her into the harness, that process is very uncomfortable. Even if you don't cause her any pain, it's still uncomfortable from a psychological point of view to be robbed of your ability to escape. The way I often see people put a harness on their dog is: standing with their legs fully stretched, bending at the waist to reach for the dog and grabbing or pulling the dog if it doesn't stand still and in some cases even trapping the dog between their legs. In short: people are towering over their dogs, which is a very aggressive pose in dog's body language. And since many dogs want to avoid this aggressive situation, people become even more aggressive or physically rough to just get the darn harness on. A much better pose is to kneel or sit down and offer the harness to the dog with outstretched hands. If the harness (or coat) needs to go over the head, you should hold it in a way that the dog can simply walk into it. To train this behavior, hold a treat behind the hole to lure the dog into the harness voluntarily. If kneeling down isn't an option for you, you could have the dog jump on your lap to avoid the towering pose. If the legs need to go into holes, the process is a little more complicated, but still works best without applying any force. Having their feet lifted from the ground can be disorienting for dogs. So it's better to stroke the fur from shoulder to the foot to give the dog time to either lift the foot themselves or to mentally prepare for having the foot lifted. Maintaining a calm chat of encouragements and praises also helps convey the message that this isn't an aggressive situation. If your dog is very nervous or too hyped up, you should speak with an extremely low and calm voice to calm your dog. In your specific situation you could start a harness desensitization training. Right now your dog connects the harness with negative memories, so she hates the sight of it. By connecting the harness with positive experiences, you can change her mind. If you already have different harnesses, I highly recommend doing the training with a different harness than you use for walking. Get the harness out several times a day (without actually going on a walk) and offer a treat in the close proximity of it. Your dog should simply come to you and eat the treat. After that you simply put the harness away again. It may take a few tries at first before she even takes the treat, but eventually she will trust that she can eat it without having to put the harness on. Once she reliably takes the treat, you can adapt the training to make her put her head through the harness in order to take the treat. A few days after she started doing that reliably, you can start putting her legs through the holes and rewarding her with a second treat, but still without closing the clasps and going out. Only when she voluntarily puts her head into the harness and you can calmly put her legs through the holes should you switch to using the training harness for your actual walks."
Why doesn't my cat like being held?,"It may be the cat's personality; however, you may well be able to change that to some extent. We adopted our cat when she was about two years old.  (She is now about thirteen.)  At first, she was very skittish and spent most of her day hiding behind furniture.  It's possible that she was badly treated by her previous owner, and certainly she was traumatized by the noisy, competitive shelter.  To this day she is still rather hesitant to approach strangers; and she still does not like to be picked up.  (The latter is because we have not tried to alter this behavior, and usually when we pick her up we're about to stuff her in her carrier to go to the vet, or give her medication!) Here's what we did to encourage her to be petted. Nowadays she responds to her name; she jumps on the bed and purrs if she sees that we're there; and she will come over and jump on my lap (and purr) if she sees me sit down.  We've even trained her to meow for treats, ""stand up"" and paw at my leg to get me to pet her, etc.  She did not do any of this when we first adopted her -- and she was an adult at that point.  So don't give up: it can be a long, slow process, but at least in our experience, it is possible and quite rewarding in the end!"
Cat Keeps Drinking Unattended Drinks,"I propose replacing his assigned water bowl with something he likes drinking from, like a dessert glass bowl or a drinking glass with a low rim. Different containers can add their own smell and taste to the water in them, especially containers that aren't supposed to hold liquids for a long time. The main reason why water bottles have a use before date is not that the water somehow goes bad, but that the bottle itself slowly breaks down and releases weird chemicals into the water. To make him unlearn that he can find drinkable water in your glass, you should always put a lid on your glass. There are different types available online or in stores for kitchenware. I think it would be best to find a lid that fits your usual drinking glass as best as possible, or maybe buy a new glass with a lid included."
Can I use human medicine on dogs?,"Never give pets human medication unless advised by your local Veterinarian. People may be tempted to try and save money, by bypassing a trip to the Vet or paying for expensive Veterinary medications and products. Unfortunately the cost of looking after our pets can be high, but to try and help our pets with well meaning shortcuts, by using human products and medications is not a viable solution. Animals metabolise drugs differently from human beings and differently between species. What may be effective in a human being, may be harmful or potentially fatal for a dog. Top 10 Dog Poisons Dog poison No. 1: Prescription medications for people. Drugs that
might be beneficial or even lifesaving for people can have the
opposite effect in pets. And it doesn’t always take a large dose to do
major damage. Some of the most common and harmful medications that poison dogs
include: Common Dog Poisons Medications that can be toxic at certain doses include: Aspirin, Paracetamol and Ibuprofen. Other medications that should not be given to your dog as they can be potentially lethal, even in small doses, include: Antidepressants – can cause vomiting and lethargy with certain types leading to serotonin syndrome.
ADHD medications – act as a stimulant and dangerously elevate heart rate, blood pressure and body temperature.
Anti-cancer drugs.
Anti-diabetics – cause a major drop in blood sugar levels causing disorientation, lack of coordination and seizures.
Cold medicines – acts as a stimulant causing elevated heart rates, blood pressure, body temperature and seizures.
Vitamin D derivatives – cause life-threatening spikes in blood calcium levels in pets that can lead to kidney failure.
Diet pills.
Muscle relaxants – can impair the central nervous system and lead to death. (2) It's important never to assume: An important note to make is, although many medications may be the same that is used for a pet and a human, it is important not to dose a pet based on the dosage given to a person. It is not just a weight by weight correlation, different species may require a varying dose per weight, as they have different metabolisms. The only exception: On the written advice of a Veterinarian:
For instance, you take your dog to the Veterinarian and the Vet gives you written instructions on the use of any over the counter medications  with explicit dosage guides. References: WebMD (1) Department of Environment and Primary Industries (DEPI)
